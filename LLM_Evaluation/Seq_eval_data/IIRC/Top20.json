            "Chunk[1]:\nNew Horizons has captured distant images of Triton, Quaoar, Haumea, Eris, and Makemake, as well as the smaller candidates Ixion, 2002 MS4, and 2014 OE394.\n\n",

            "Chunk[3]:\nIn particular, Salacia has a known mass and diameter, putting it as a borderline case by the IAU's 2006 Q&A.\n\nAt the time Makemake and Haumea were named, it was thought that trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with icy cores would require a diameter of only about 400 km (250 mi), or 3% the size of Earth – the size of the moons Mimas, the smallest moon that is round, and Proteus, the largest that is not – to relax into gravitational equilibrium.\n",
            "Chunk[4]:\nBut in 2019 Grundy et al. proposed, based on their studies of Gǃkúnǁʼhòmdímà, that dark, low-density bodies smaller than about 900–1000 km in diameter, such as Salacia and Varda, never fully collapsed into solid planetary bodies and retain internal porosity from their formation (in which case they could not be dwarf planets). They accept that brighter (albedo > ≈0.2) or denser (> ≈1.4\n",
            "Chunk[5]:\nThough large relative to asteroids, Ceres is small compared with many other solid bodies in the solar system.\n",
            "Chunk[6]:\nWith the discovery of Pluto in 1930, most astronomers considered the Solar System to have nine major planets, along with thousands of significantly smaller bodies (asteroids and comets).\n",
            "Chunk[7]:\nErecting lenses  In aprismatic binoculars with Keplerian optics (which were sometimes called \"twin telescopes\"), each tube has one or two additional lenses (relay lens) between the objective and the eyepiece.\n",
            "Chunk[8]:\nAs of 13 September 2019, Brown's list identifies ten trans-Neptunian objects with diameters then thought to be greater than 900 km (the four named by the IAU plus Gonggong, Quaoar, Sedna, Orcus, (307261) 2002 MS4, and Salacia) as \"near certain\" to be dwarf planets, and another 16, with diameter greater than 600 km, as \"highly likely\".\n",

            "Chunk[11]:\nThere is no clear upper limit: an object very far out in the Solar System that is more massive than Mercury might not have had time to clear its neighbourhood; such a body would fit the definition of dwarf planet rather than planet. Indeed, Mike Brown set out to find such an object.\n",
            "Chunk[12]:\nMost early binoculars used Galilean optics; that is, they used a convex objective and a concave eyepiece lens.\n",
            "Chunk[13]:\nThis was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community.\n",
            "Chunk[14]:\nThe IAU only established guidelines for which committee would oversee the naming of likely dwarf planets: any unnamed trans-Neptunian object with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 (and hence a minimum diameter of 838 km at the maximum geometric albedo of 1) was to be named by a joint committee consisting of the Minor Planet Center and the planetary working group of the IAU.\n",
            "Chunk[15]:\nPallas (minor-planet designation: 2 Pallas) is the third-largest asteroid in the Solar System by volume and mass.\n",
            "Chunk[16]:\nA dwarf planet is a small planetary-mass object that is in direct orbit around the Sun, massive enough to be gravitationally rounded, but insufficient to achieve orbital dominance like the eight classical planets of the Solar System.\n",
            "Chunk[17]:\nCeres's small size means that even at its brightest it is too dim to be seen by the naked eye, except under extremely dark skies.\n",
