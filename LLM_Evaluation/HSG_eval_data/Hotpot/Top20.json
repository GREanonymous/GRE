Lamprocles was a youth (μειράκιον meirakion) at the time of Socrates' trial and death.  \ncontext 2: Lamprocles  was Socrates' and Xanthippe's eldest son. His two brothers were Menexenus and Sophroniscus.\ncontext 3: Lamprocles, Menexenus, and Sophroniscus were the three sons of Socrates and Xanthippe. Lamprocles was a young boy during his father's trial and death. Menexenus and Sophroniscus were also children at the time, with one of them being small enough to be held in their mother's arms.\ncontext 4: One additional reason for thinking Xanthippe's family was socially prominent was that her eldest son was named Lamprocles instead of \"Sophroniscus\" after Socrates' father Sophroniscus: the ancient Greek custom was to name one's first child after the more illustrious of the two grandfathers. Xanthippe's father is believed to have been named Lamprocles.\ncontext 5: Aristotle described Socrates' descendants as unremarkable, including Lamprocles, Socrates' and Xanthippe's eldest son. The name Lamprocles, rather than Sophroniscus, suggests Xanthippe's family had aristocratic prominence, as her father was also named Lamprocles. Xenophon's portrayal of Xanthippe includes Lamprocles' complaint about her harshness.\ncontext 6: According to Aristotle, Socrates' descendants as a whole turned out to be unremarkable \"fools and dullards\". Lamprocles (Greek: Λαμπροκλῆς) was Socrates' and Xanthippe's eldest son.  \ncontext 7: Xanthippe (; Greek: Ξανθίππη [ksantʰíppɛː]; fl. 5th–4th century BCE) was an ancient Athenian, the wife of Socrates and mother of their three sons: Lamprocles, Sophroniscus, and Menexenus.\ncontext 8: Lamprocles was only a boy (μειράκιον \"meirakion\") at the time of Socrates' trial and death.\ncontext 9: Socrates, a pivotal figure in Western philosophy, was married to Xanthippe and had three sons: Lamprocles, Menexenus, and Sophroniscus. Despite his influential philosophical contributions, Socrates was sentenced to death in 399 BC, accused of impiety and corrupting the youth. His legacy is primarily documented through Plato's dialogues, which detail his trial and execution, as well as his belief that virtue cannot be taught, critiquing Athenian society's moral education.\ncontext 10: Menexenus (; Greek: Μενέξενоς) was one of the three sons of Socrates and Xanthippe. His two brothers were Lamprocles and Sophroniscus.  \ncontext 11: Anthene lamprocles, the lesser black-patches, is a butterfly in the family Lycaenidae.\ncontext 12: Xanthippe was an ancient Athenian woman who lived in the 5th-4th century BCE, known for being the wife of the philosopher Socrates and the mother of their three sons: Lamprocles, Sophroniscus, and Menexenus. Different accounts of Xanthippe's life, including one involving a character named Myrto, are provided by Aristoxenus in his \"Life of Socrates,\" which he claims is based on firsthand accounts from his father. These accounts offer varying perspectives on Xanthippe's relationship with Socrates and her personal life.\ncontext 13: In 399 BC, he was accused of impiety and corrupting the youth. After a trial that lasted a day, he was sentenced to death. He spent his last day in prison, refusing offers to help him escape.\ncontext 14: \"The Death of Socrates\" is a 1787 painting by Jacques-Louis David depicting the execution of Socrates, who was sentenced to death by drinking poison hemlock for corrupting Athenian youth and introducing strange gods. Plato's works, including \"Apology,\" \"Euthyphro,\" \"Crito,\" and \"Phaedo,\" chronicle Socrates' final days and his trial for impiety and corruption. These dialogues are key sources for understanding the trial and death of Socrates, as depicted by Plato.\ncontext 15: The Death of Socrates (French: La Mort de Socrate) is an oil on canvas painted by French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787.\ncontext 16: Xenophon, in his Memorabilia, portrays her in much the same light. However, he does make Lamprocles complain of her harshness.\ncontext 17: Socrates, a Greek philosopher from Athens, is considered the founder of Western philosophy and one of the earliest moral philosophers, but was sentenced to death in 399 BC after being accused of impiety and corrupting the youth. Sennedjem, an Ancient Egyptian artisan, lived in Set Maat during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II, and was buried with his family in a tomb discovered in 1886. Sócrates, a Brazilian footballer, began his career in Brazil, moved to Italy to play for Fiorentina, and returned to Brazil in 1985 to conclude his career.\ncontext 18: Socrates (; Greek: Σωκράτης; c. 470 – 399 BC) was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as the founder of Western philosophy and as among the first moral philosophers of the ethical tradition of thought.\ncontext 19: A different account of Xanthippe and Myrto is given in Aristoxenus's Life of Socrates written in the latter part of the fourth century BC that Aristoxenus asserts is based on first-person accounts by his father.\ncontext 20: The hippos in an ancient Greek name often suggested aristocratic heritage.\n\n        Question is: **Where did Lamprocles's father die?**\n        Answer in less than 6 words.
