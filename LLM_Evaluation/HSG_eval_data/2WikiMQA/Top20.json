There are two distinct kings named Rhescuporis I, one from the Odrysian period and another from the Sapaean period, which complicates the historical narrative. Additionally, Rhescuporis is a name shared by several kings across different Thracian kingdoms and Roman client kings of the Bosporan Kingdom, spanning multiple centuries.\ncontext 3: Rhescuporis I was a king of the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace from 240 BC to 215 BC, succeeding his father Cotys III, though the historical accuracy of this succession and the dating of related inscriptions and coins are questioned. The Odrysian kingdom, an ancient Thracian state encompassing present-day Bulgaria and parts of southeastern Europe, was founded by King Teres I and later became the Roman province of Thracia.

Lamprocles, the eldest, is noted as unremarkable by Aristotle and is associated with Xanthippe's aristocratic lineage, while Xenophon describes Xanthippe as harsh, a trait Lamprocles complained about. Socrates' trial and death, vividly depicted in Jacques-Louis David's painting \"The Death of Socrates\" and detailed in Plato's dialogues, remain key events in understanding his life and philosophy.\ncontext 5: Lamprocles, Menexenus, and Sophroniscus were the three sons of Socrates and Xanthippe. Lamprocles was a young boy during his father's trial and death, while his brothers, Menexenus and Sophroniscus, were also children, with one being small enough to be held in their mother's arms. These details highlight the young ages of Socrates' sons during this significant and tragic period in their lives.\ncontext 6: Aristotle described Socrates' descendants as unremarkable, including Lamprocles, Socrates' and Xanthippe's eldest son. The name Lamprocles, rather than Sophroniscus, suggests Xanthippe's family had aristocratic prominence, as her father was also named Lamprocles. Xenophon's portrayal of Xanthippe includes Lamprocles' complaint about her harshness.\ncontext 7: According to Aristotle, Socrates' descendants as a whole turned out to be unremarkable \"fools and dullards\". Lamprocles (Greek: Λαμπροκλῆς) was Socrates' and Xanthippe's eldest son.  \ncontext 8: Xanthippe (; Greek: Ξανθίππη [ksantʰíppɛː]; fl. 5th–4th century BCE) was an ancient Athenian, the wife of Socrates and mother of their three sons: Lamprocles, Sophroniscus, and Menexenus.\ncontext 9: Lamprocles was only a boy (μειράκιον \"meirakion\") at the time of Socrates' trial and death.\ncontext 10: Menexenus (; Greek: Μενέξενоς) was one of the three sons of Socrates and Xanthippe. His two brothers were Lamprocles and Sophroniscus.  \ncontext 11: Anthene lamprocles, the lesser black-patches, is a butterfly in the family Lycaenidae.\ncontext 12: Xanthippe was an ancient Athenian woman who lived in the 5th-4th century BCE, known for being the wife of the philosopher Socrates and the mother of their three sons: Lamprocles, Sophroniscus, and Menexenus. Her character and relationship with Socrates are often mentioned in historical accounts, though details vary. Aristoxenus, a later historian, provided a different account of Xanthippe and another woman named Myrto in his \"Life of Socrates,\" which he claimed was based on first-person accounts from his father.\ncontext 13: In 399 BC, he was accused of impiety and corrupting the youth. After a trial that lasted a day, he was sentenced to death. He spent his last day in prison, refusing offers to help him escape.\ncontext 14: The Death of Socrates (French: La Mort de Socrate) is an oil on canvas painted by French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787.\ncontext 15: Xenophon, in his Memorabilia, portrays her in much the same light. However, he does make Lamprocles complain of her harshness.\ncontext 16: Socrates, a classical Greek philosopher from Athens, is recognized as one of the founders of Western philosophy and the first moral philosopher in the Western ethical tradition. Sennedjem, an Ancient Egyptian artisan, lived in Set Maat during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II, and was buried with his family in a tomb discovered in 1886. In Aristophanes' play The Clouds, Socrates is depicted as a sophistic philosopher teaching a young man to justify striking his father, contrasting with Socrates' own philosophical stance that virtue cannot be taught.\ncontext 17: Socrates (; Greek: Σωκράτης; c. 470 – 399 BC) was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as the founder of Western philosophy and as among the first moral philosophers of the ethical tradition of thought.\ncontext 18: In 399 BC, Socrates was tried for impiety and corrupting the youth, resulting in a death sentence he accepted without escape. The Death of Socrates, painted by Jacques-Louis David in 1787, depicts Socrates' execution by poison hemlock, a scene also described in Plato's Phaedo, which along with Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito, chronicles Socrates' final days. The Apology of Socrates, another of Plato's dialogues, specifically recounts Socrates' defense at his trial, making it a key source on the philosopher's trial and death.\ncontext 19: A different account of Xanthippe and Myrto is given in Aristoxenus's Life of Socrates written in the latter part of the fourth century BC that Aristoxenus asserts is based on first-person accounts by his father.\ncontext 20: The hippos in an ancient Greek name often suggested aristocratic heritage.\n\n        Question is: **Where did Lamprocles's father die?**\n        Answer in less than 6 words.
