        "answer": "Canadian",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Which country the performer of song Soldier (Neil Young Song) is from?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nAstrid North( Astrid Karina North Radmann; 24 August 1973, Berlin – 25 June 2019, Berlin) was a German soul singer and songwriter. She was the singer of the German band, with whom she released five Albums. As guest singer of the band she published three albums. Harvest is the fourth studio album by Canadian-American musician Neil Young, released on February 1, 1972, by Reprise Records, catalogue number MS 2032. It featured the London Symphony Orchestra on two tracks and vocals by guests David Crosby, Graham Nash, Linda Ronstadt, Stephen Stills, and James Taylor. It topped the Billboard 200 album chart for two weeks, and spawned two hit singles, \"Old Man\", which peaked at No. 31 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and \"Heart of Gold\", which reached No. 1. It was the best-selling album of 1972 in the United States. The album has since remained Neil Young's signature album as well as his best selling. In 2015, Harvest was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.    Background  In 1970, Young released both Déjà Vu with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and his third solo album, After the Gold Rush. The year also saw Young tour as a solo act and with both CSNY and his collaborators Crazy Horse. In the fall of 1970, Young released After the Gold Rush, divorced his wife Susan Acevedo, and purchased Broken Arrow Ranch in Redwood City, California, where he would live for the next four decades. While renovating his new home, Young injured his back, limiting his mobility and ability to perform electric guitar. Around the same time, Young would also begin his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress. Young's new home and romantic relationship would inspire several new songs.  After completing After the Gold Rush, Young promoted the album through a series of solo acoustic concerts. After playing Carnegie Hall in December 1970, Young returned to his ranch for a break in touring. While picking up a slab of walnut, Young injured his back, which prevented him from standing up while performing, limiting him to playing acoustic music. Young explains in an August 1975 interview with Cameron Crowe for Rolling Stone: I was in and out of hospitals for the two years between After the Gold Rush and Harvest. I have one weak side and all the muscles slipped on me. My discs slipped. I couldn't hold my guitar up. That's why I sat down on my whole solo tour. I couldn't move around too well, so I laid low for a long time on the ranch and just didn't have any contact, you know. I wore a brace. Crosby would come up to see how I was, we'd go for a walk and it took me 45 minutes to get to the studio, which is only 400 yards from the house. I could only stand up four hours a day. I recorded most of Harvest in the brace. That's a lot of the reason it's such a mellow album. I couldn't physically play an electric guitar. \"Are You Ready for the Country\", \"Alabama\", and \"Words\" were all done after I had the operation. The doctors were starting to talk about wheelchairs and shit, so I had some discs removed. But for the most part, I spent two years flat on my back. Young embarked on a solo acoustic tour in January and February 1971 where he debuted many of the album's songs. A performance on The Johnny Cash Show led to collaborations with record producer Elliot Mazer and Nashville studio musicians. In Nashville, Young recruited a group of country session musicians, whom he would dub The Stray Gators to record his new songs. The resulting record was a massive hit, producing a US number one single in \"Heart of Gold\". The album's success caught Young off guard and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. He would later write that the record \"put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\"    Writing  In a post on his website, Young shares that much of Harvest \"was written about or for Carrie Snodgress, a wonderful actress and person and Zeke Young's mother.\" In a radio interview, Young specifically cites \"Heart of Gold\", \"Harvest\" and \"Out on the Weekend\" as being inspired by his then blossoming love.  \"A Man Needs a Maid\" was also inspired by Young's budding relationship with Snodgress, whom he contacted after seeing her picture in a magazine. At a Philadelphia concert in October 2014, Young shared that the song was also inspired by a light switch in a hotel he stayed at while touring with CSNY: Now maid is a word that's been hijacked. It doesn't mean what it means anymore. Now it's like a derogatory thing. It's something bad. Someone working. Sometimes I tell a little story here about something. Kinda tears it for people a little bit. So a while ago a long time ago I was in a band and we were playing in London. I was in this hotel and there was this light switch on the wall. Decade is a compilation album by Canadian–American musician Neil Young, originally released in 1977 as a triple album and later issued on two compact discs. It contains 35 of Young's songs recorded between 1966 and 1976, among them five tracks that had been unreleased up to that point. It peaked at No. 43 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart, and was certified platinum by the RIAA in 1986.    History  Compiled by Young himself, with his hand-written liner notes about each track, Decade represents almost every album from his career and various affiliations through 1977 with the exception of 4 Way Street and Time Fades Away. Of the previously unreleased songs, \"Down to the Wire\" features the New Orleans pianist Dr. John with Buffalo Springfield on an item from their shelved Stampede album; \"Love Is a Rose\" was a minor hit for Linda Ronstadt in 1975; \"Winterlong\" received a cover by Pixies on the Neil Young tribute album from 1989, The Bridge; and \"Campaigner\" is a Young song critical of Richard Nixon.  The track \"Long May You Run\" is a different mix to that found on the album of the same name, featuring the harmonies of the full Crosby Stills & Nash before David Crosby and Graham Nash left the recording sessions. For many years, Decade was the only Neil Young compilation album available. A 1993 compilation called Lucky Thirteen was released, but it only covered Young's 1982–1988 output. It was not until 2004 that Reprise Records released a single-disc retrospective of his best-known tracks, titled Greatest Hits. Throughout the 1980s and '90s, Young promised fans a follow-up to the original Decade collection, provisionally titled Decade II; eventually, this idea was scrapped in favor of a much more comprehensive anthology to be titled Archives, spanning his entire career and ranging in size from a box set to an entire series of audio and/or video releases. The first release of archival material since Decade and Lucky Thirteen would appear in 2006, Live at the Fillmore East, a recording from a 1970 concert featuring Crazy Horse with Danny Whitten. Several other archival live releases followed, and in 2009 the first of several planned multi-disc box sets, The Archives Vol. 1 1963–1972, was issued. In April 2017 Decade was reissued on vinyl as a limited-edition Record Store Day release, with remastered vinyl and CD editions planned for general release in June 2017.    Alternate early version  Initially, Decade was to be released in 1976, but was pulled at the last minute by Young.  It was shelved until the following year, where it appeared with two songs removed from the original track list (a live version of \"Don't Cry No Tears\" recorded in Japan in 1976, and a live version of \"Pushed It Over the End\" recorded in 1974). Also removed were the following comments on those two songs and Time Fades Away, from Young's handwritten liner notes:  Time Fades Away. No songs from this album are included here. It was recorded on my biggest tour ever, 65 shows in 90 days. Money hassles among everyone concerned ruined this tour and record for me but I released it anyway so you folks could see what could happen if you lose it for a while.  I was becoming more interested in an audio verité approach than satisfying the public demands for a repetition of Harvest. Don't Cry No Tears. Initially titled 'I Wonder,' this song was written in 1964.  One of my first songs.  This is a live recording from Japan with Crazy Horse.  Pushed It over the End. Recorded live on the road in Chicago, 1974.  Thanks to Crosby & Nash's help on the overdubbed chorus, I was able to complete this work.  I wrote it for Patty Hearst and her countless brothers and sisters.  Also, I wrote it for myself and the increasing distance between me and you.    Reception   The album has been lauded in many quarters as one of the best examples of a career retrospective for a rock artist, and as a template for the box set collections that would follow in the 1980s and beyond. However, in the original article on Young from the first edition of the Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll and a subsequent article in the 1983 Rolling Stone Record Guide, critic Dave Marsh used this album to accuse Young of deliberately manufacturing a self-mythology, arguing that while his highlights could be seen to place him on a level with other artists from his generation like Bob Dylan or The Beatles, the particulars of his catalogue did not bear this out.

It was released as a single, backed with Stephen Stills's \"Find the Cost of Freedom\", peaking at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 16 in Canada. Although live versions of \"Ohio\" and \"Find the Cost of Freedom\" were included on the group's 1971 double album 4 Way Street, the studio versions of both songs did not appear on an LP until the group's compilation So Far was released in 1974. The song also appeared on the Neil Young compilation albums Decade, released in 1977, and Greatest Hits, released in 2004.\nThe song also appears on Neil Young's Live at Massey Hall album, which he recorded in 1971 but remained unreleased until 2007.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nYoung wrote the lyrics to \"Ohio\" after seeing the photos of the incident in Life Magazine. On the evening that the group entered Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, the song had already been rehearsed, and the quartet—with their new rhythm section of Calvin Samuels and Johnny Barbata—recorded it live in just a few takes. During the same session, they recorded the single's equally direct B-side, Stephen Stills's ode to the war's dead, \"Find the Cost of Freedom\".\nThe record was mastered with the participation of the four principals, rush-released by Atlantic and heard on the radio with only a few weeks' delay (even though the group's hit song \"Teach Your Children\" was already on the charts at the time). In his liner notes for the Decade retrospective, Young termed the Kent State incident as \"probably the biggest lesson ever learned at an American place of learning\" and reported that \"David Crosby cried when we finished this take.\" In the fade, Crosby's voice—with a tone evocative of keening—can be heard with the words \"Four!\", \"Why?\" and \"How many more?\".\nAccording to the liner notes in Greatest Hits, the track was recorded by Bill Halverson on May 21, 1970, at Record Plant Studio 3 in Hollywood.\n\n\n== Lyrics and reception ==\nAn article in The Guardian in 2010 describes the song as the \"greatest protest record\" and \"the pinnacle of a very 1960s genre\", while also saying \"The revolution never came.\" President Richard Nixon, who is criticized in the song, won a landslide reelection in 1972, which included winning the 1972 United States presidential election in Ohio by a margin of over 21%. The lyrics help evoke the turbulent mood of horror, outrage, and shock in the wake of the shootings, especially the line \"four dead in Ohio\", repeated throughout the song. \n\"Tin soldiers and Nixon coming\" refers to the Kent State shootings, where Ohio National Guard officers shot and killed four students during a protest against the Vietnam War. Crosby once stated that Young keeping Nixon's name in the lyrics was \"the bravest thing I ever heard.\" The American counterculture took the group as its own after this song, giving the four a status as leaders and spokesmen they would enjoy to a varying extent for the rest of the decade.\nAt the time of the shooting the American public was highly critical of the protestors and blamed them for the violence. This is what the line \"What if you knew her? / And found her dead on the ground\" was about. Sociology professor David Karen said the importance of the song was that \"it didn't let the moment die\" and \"underlined just how corrupt and awful the government was.\" After the single's release, it was banned from some AM radio stations including in the state of Ohio, because of the challenge to the Nixon Administration but received airplay on underground FM stations in larger cities and college towns. Today, the song receives regular airplay on classic rock stations. The song was selected as the 395th Greatest Song of All Time by Rolling Stone in 2010. In 2009, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDavid Crosby – vocals; rhythm guitar on \"Ohio\"\nStephen Stills – vocals, guitars\nGraham Nash – vocals\nNeil Young – vocals, guitars\nCalvin Samuels – bass on \"Ohio\"\nJohn Barbata – drums on \"Ohio\"\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Weekly charts ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of anti-war songs\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNeil Young Ohio Lyric Analysis. Accessed on March 26, 2007. Bernard Bonvoisin, known as Bernie Bonvoisin( born 9 July 1956 in Nanterre, Hauts- de- Seine), is a French hard rock singer and film director. He is best known for having been the singer of Trust. He was one of the best friends of Bon Scott the singer of AC/ DC and together they recorded the song\" Ride On\" which was one of the last songs by Bon Scott. \" Panda\" is a song of the Chilean band Astro and is the fifth song of the homonymous album of the year 2011. The song was composed and produced by the singer of the band Andrés Nusser and released like third single of the album on February 1, 2013. Tonight's the Night is the sixth studio album by Canadian / American songwriter Neil Young. It was recorded in August–September 1973, mostly on August 26, but its release was delayed until June 1975. It peaked at No. 25 on the Billboard 200. The album is the third and final of the so-called \"Ditch Trilogy\" of albums that Young released following the major success of 1972's Harvest, whereupon the scope of his success and acclaim became so difficult for Young to handle that he subsequently experienced alienation from his music and career. In 2003, the album was ranked number 331 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, moving up to number 330 in the list's 2012 edition and climbing further to number 302 in the 2020 update.     Background  Tonight's the Night is a direct expression of grief. Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten and Young's friend and roadie Bruce Berry had both died of drug overdoses in the months before the songs were written. Bruce Berry was the brother of both Jan Berry of Jan and Dean fame and of Ken Berry, owner of S.I.R. studios where the album was recorded. Berry leveraged his music industry connections to work as a roadie for both Young and Stephen Stills during his Manassas tour. Berry died of a heroin overdose in June 1973. Danny Whitten was a singer, songwriter and guitarist in the band Crazy Horse, with whom Young had recorded two albums. He died in November 1972 the night after Young fired him during rehearsals for the Time Fades Away tour due to his inability to play. The sessions were the first time the remaining members of Crazy Horse had played together since the passing of Whitten. In 1975 Young explained to Bud Scoppa of Creem magazine how the loss was both personal and professional: \"At S.I.R. we were playing, and these two cats who had been a close part of our unit – of our force and our energy – were both gone to junk. Both of them O.D.'d, and we're playing in a place where we're getting together to make up for what is gone and try to make ourselves stronger and continue. Because we thought we had it with Danny Whitten – at least I did. I thought that I had a combination of people that could be as effective as groups like the Rolling Stones had been. Just for rhythm, which I'm really into. I haven't had that rhythm for a while and that's why I haven't been playing my guitar; because without that behind me I won't play. I mean you can't get free enough. So I've had to play the rhythm myself ever since Danny died\". Tonight's the Night was not the first of Young's work to concern the dangers of heroin and the toll it had taken on the musicians around him. \"The Needle and the Damage Done\" from the album Harvest addresses the topic directly, and was partly inspired by Whitten's struggles. The song was also inspired by several other artists Young had seen fall to heroin, as he explained to a January 1971 audience: \"I got to see to see a lot of great musicians before they happened. Before they became famous. When they were just gigging. Five and six sets a night. Things like that. I got to see a lot of great musicians who nobody got to see for one reason or another. But strangely enough the real good ones that you never got to see was because of heroin. And that started happening over and over. And then it happened to some that everybody knew about.\"  The title track \"Tonight's the Night\" mentions Berry by name, while Whitten's guitar and vocal work highlight \"Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown\", taken from a March 1970 Crazy Horse concert at the Fillmore East. The song later appeared, unedited, on a live album from the same concerts, Live at the Fillmore East, with Whitten credited as the sole author. Nils Lofgren's guitar parts on the album are intentionally played in a style reminiscent of how Berry would play: \"When I use Nils, like on Tonight's the Night I used him for piano, and I played piano on a couple of songs and he played guitar. In the songs where he plays guitar he's actually playing as Bruce Berry, the way Bruce Berry played guitar. The thing is, I'm talking about him and you can hear him. So Nils just fits in – he plays that hot rock & roll style guitar. He was really into it.\" The band assembled for the album was known as The Santa Monica Flyers. It consisted of Young, Ben Keith, Nils Lofgren, and the Crazy Horse rhythm section of Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. Young had previously recorded with Talbot and Molina on Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, with Lofgren on After the Gold Rush and with Keith on Harvest. \"Soldier\" is a song by Neil Young from the 1972 soundtrack album, \"Journey Through the Past\". It was the only new track included on the album, and was later released on the 1977 compilation \"Decade\", although it was slightly edited. The song observes how a soldier's eyes \"shine like the sun. \" In the second verse, Young sings he does not believe Jesus because he \"can't deliver right away\". \"Soldier\" is a song by Neil Young from the 1972 soundtrack album, Journey Through the Past. It was the only new track included on the album, and was later released on the 1977 compilation Decade, although it was slightly edited.\nThe song observes how a soldier's eyes \"shine like the sun.\" In the second verse, Young sings he does not believe Jesus because he \"can't deliver right away\".\nAccording the Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 book (1945-1972), this recording is Neil solo on piano and vocal, recorded by L.A. Johnson inside a sawdust burner in a sawmill, Kings Mountain, California on November 18, 1971. According to Neil Young's notes from the Decade 3-Record set(1977), the sounds in the background are of a roaring fire. This song is published by Silver Fiddle/BMI. \" O Valencia!\" is the fifth single by the indie rock band The Decemberists, and the first released from their fourth studio album,\" The Crane Wife\". The music was written by The Decemberists and the lyrics by Colin Meloy. It tells a story of two star- crossed lovers. The singer falls in love with a person who belongs to an opposing gang. At the end of the song, the singer's lover jumps in to defend the singer, who is confronting his lover's brother( the singer's\" sworn enemy\") and is killed by the bullet intended for the singer. The discography and filmography of Neil Young contains both albums and films produced by Young. Through his career most of Young's work has been recorded for and distributed by Reprise Records, a company owned by Warner Bros. Records since 1963 and now part of the Warner Music Group. The only exceptions are Young's five albums for Geffen Records in the 1980s, which were once distributed by Warner, but are now distributed by Universal Music Group.\n\n\n== Albums ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\nNotes\n\n\n=== EPs ===\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\n\nNeil Young has included material recorded live on many of his albums; listed here are albums consisting completely or primarily of live concert recordings.

The album was first released on November 12, 1968, in the so-called 'CSG mix'. It was then partially remixed and re-released in late summer 1969, but at no time has the album ever charted on the Billboard 200.    Background  The album is Young's first solo record after releasing three albums with Buffalo Springfield. After their final breakup, Young hired Joni Mitchell's manager Elliot Roberts to also manage his career. Roberts continued to serve as Young's manager until his passing in 2019. Roberts organized Young's first solo tour of coffeehouses and negotiated a record contract for Young with Reprise Records, a division of Warner. The album also marks Young's first collaboration with record producer David Briggs. Young met Briggs in Topanga Canyon, then a nexus of music talent, while Briggs was living in Stephen Stills' old house. They met one day when Briggs offered Young a ride, and they quickly became friends. David Briggs would go on to produce the vast majority of Young's albums until his death in 1995.    Songs  According to Young in his memoir Waging Heavy Peace, the songs on the album represent a variety of different themes. Some of the songs had been recently written, while others dated back to his time with Buffalo Springfield: \"The songs were gathered from the past and the future, mostly dreams, nothing concrete; they were mostly created as vehicles for record-making, like \"Here We Are in the Years,\" or personal expression and longing, such as \"I’ve Been Waiting for You.\" Some of them were stream-of-consciousness, like \"The Last Trip to Tulsa,\" with no preconceived thought behind them. They were just songs. There was no big pressure on me at that time to top anything I had already done. That came later. The sky was the limit. I had no idea what was coming my way.\" \"The Emperor of Wyoming\" and \"String Quartet from Whiskey Boot Hill\" are both instrumentals. Young recorded many such instrumentals during his time with Buffalo Springfield. One such instrumental, \"Falcon Lake (Ash on the Floor)\" would be reworked into \"Here We Are in the Years.\" \"String Quartet from Whiskey Boot Hill\" is a string quartet performance of an instrumental Young had previously recorded during his time with the band. He would later incorporate the song into the \"Country Girl Suite\" on CSNY's Déjà Vu. Young would also revisit the melody of \"The Emperor of Wyoming\" during his mid-1980s country era, recording the song with lyrics as \"Leaving the Top 40 Behind.\" \"The Loner\" was released as a single. The guitar driven rock song employs D modal tuning, which Young learned alongside Stephen Stills, who used it on \"Bluebird.\" Stills would later cover the song on his 1976 album Illegal Stills. The track's guitar sound presages Young's work on his next album, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. Young acknowledges this in a 1973 radio interview: \"On my first album, I like \"The Loner.\" I felt like I was getting into something different there, starting to.\" At the March 7, 1970 Fillmore concert with CSNY, Young remembers reading one early review of the song that wrote \"this snappy little item should send Young rising Phoenix-like from the ashes of the Buffalo Springfield,\" which pleased Young and boosted his confidence in his solo career. \"The Old Laughing Lady\" is the oldest song on the album, having been written three years prior. Young wrote the song before his time in The Mynah Birds, while playing coffee houses in Michigan, across the border from Ontario. He remembers in Shakey: \"I had a series of gigs; maybe Joni and Chuck Mitchell might’ve gotten these gigs in the Detroit/Ann Arbor area: solo acoustic, before the Mynah Birds. Chess Mate coffeehouse, an old folk club in Detroit, Livernois and One-eleventh. Very near there is where the White Tower is. \"The Old Laughing Lady;\" I was having some coffee and wrote it on napkins. I don’t know what prompted it. It came out on a napkin, no guitar. Hangin’ out in a coffee shop.\" He explained further to a concert audience: \"We had come out of the Chess Mate Club and found out that someone had left with part of our car and we had to wait for a while in this restaurant. We had to wait for almost a day. It was out of sight. Guys propositioning me at four o'clock in the morning. I wrote it out on a napkin in true folk tradition. Sounds very good. And then I went home and put it in D-modal tuning which was very hip. Neil Percival Young (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian singer-songwriter. After embarking on a music career in the 1960s, he moved to Los Angeles, where he formed Buffalo Springfield with Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and others. Young had released two solo albums and three as a member of Buffalo Springfield by the time he joined Crosby, Stills & Nash in 1969. From his early solo albums and those with his backing band Crazy Horse, Young has recorded a steady stream of studio and live albums, sometimes warring with his recording company along the way. Young's guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature tenor singing voice define his long career. Young also plays piano and harmonica on many albums, which frequently combine folk, rock, country and other musical styles. His often distorted electric guitar playing, especially with Crazy Horse, earned him the nickname \"Godfather of Grunge\" and led to his 1995 album \"Mirror Ball\" with Pearl Jam. More recently Young has been backed by Promise of the Real. Young directed (or co-directed) films using the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\", including \"Journey Through the Past\" (1973), \"Rust Never Sleeps\" (1979), \"Human Highway\" (1982), \"Greendale\" (2003), and \"CSNY/Déjà Vu\" (2008). He also contributed to the soundtracks of the films \"Philadelphia\" (1993) and \"Dead Man\" (1995). Young has received several Grammy and Juno awards. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him twice: as a solo artist in 1995 and in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield. In 2000, \"Rolling Stone\" named Young the 34th greatest rock 'n roll artist. He has lived in California since the 1960s but retains Canadian citizenship. He was awarded the Order of Manitoba on July 14, 2006, and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada on December 30, 2009. Neil Percival Young  (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian and American singer-songwriter. After embarking on a music career in Winnipeg in the 1960s, Young moved to Los Angeles, joining the folk-rock group Buffalo Springfield. Since the beginning of his solo career, often with backing by the band Crazy Horse, he has released critically acclaimed albums such as Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (1969), After the Gold Rush (1970), Harvest (1972), On the Beach (1974), and Rust Never Sleeps (1979). He was also a part-time member of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, with whom he recorded the chart-topping 1970 album Déjà Vu. Young's guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature high tenor singing voice define his long career. He also plays piano and harmonica on many albums, which frequently combine folk, rock, country and other musical genres. His often distorted electric guitar playing, especially with Crazy Horse, earned him the nickname \"Godfather of Grunge\" and led to his 1995 album Mirror Ball with Pearl Jam. More recently he has been backed by Promise of the Real.

He also contributed to the soundtracks of the films  Philadelphia (1993) and Dead Man (1995). Young has received several Grammy and Juno Awards. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him twice: in 1995 as a solo artist and in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield. In 2023, Rolling Stone named Young No. 30 on their list of 250 greatest guitarists of all time. Young is also on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 greatest musical artists. 21 of his albums and singles have been certified Gold and Platinum in the U.S. by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba in 2006 and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2009.    Early life (1945–1963)  Neil Young was born on November 12, 1945, in Toronto. His father, Scott Alexander Young (1918–2005), was a journalist and sportswriter who also wrote fiction. His mother, Edna Blow Ragland \"Rassy\" Young (1918–1990) was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Although Canadian, his mother had American and French ancestry. Young's parents married in 1940 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and moved to Toronto shortly thereafter where their first son, Robert \"Bob\" Young, was born in 1942. Shortly after Young's birth in 1945, the family moved to rural Omemee, Ontario, which Young later described fondly as a \"sleepy little place\". Young contracted polio in the late summer of 1951 during the last major outbreak of the disease in Ontario, and as a result, became partially paralyzed on his left side. After the conclusion of his hospitalization, the Young family wintered in Florida, whose milder weather they believed would help Neil's convalescence. During that period, Young briefly attended Faulkner Elementary School in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. In 1952, upon returning to Canada, Young moved from Omemee to Pickering (1956), and lived for a year in Winnipeg (where he would later return), before relocating to Toronto (1957–1960). While in Toronto, Young briefly attended Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute as a first-year student in 1959. It is rumoured that he was expelled for riding a motorcycle down the hall of the school. Young became interested in popular music he heard on the radio. When Young was twelve, his father, who had had several extramarital affairs, left his mother. She asked for a divorce, which was granted in 1960. She moved back to Winnipeg and Young went to live with her there, while his brother Bob stayed with their father in Toronto. During the mid-1950s, Young listened to rock 'n roll, rockabilly, doo-wop, R&B, country, and western pop. He idolized Elvis Presley and later referred to him in a number of his songs. Other early musical influences included Link Wray, Lonnie Mack, Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs, The Ventures, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Chuck Berry, Hank Marvin, Little Richard, Fats Domino, The Chantels, The Monotones, Ronnie Self, the Fleetwoods, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison and Gogi Grant. The Neil Young Archives is a longtime project by singer-songwriter Neil Young. It started as a series of archival releases featuring previously released as well as unreleased studio and live recordings. It eventually developed into a website featuring almost the whole of Young's recording output throughout his career, available for streaming in high resolution audio format. The project has been long in the making – work began in the late 1980s. Throughout its development, Young himself has made several statements about the material included, release dates, and marketing that have proven false as the project was modified for new multimedia formats and expanded upon to accommodate new releases or other relevant material. As of July 26th, 2024, Young has said that there will be four volumes of Neil Young Archives box sets, this after some discussion as to whether or not to expand this number. The archives are divided into several series. The main series consists of several volumes of box sets, each covering a separate period of the artist's career. The Performance Series consists of individual releases of live material, each representing a specific show or tour. Finally, there is the Special Release Series, which consists of previously unreleased albums. These different series also overlap; for example, two volumes of the Performance Series that are included on each of the first two Archives box set releases are also available separately. Homegrown is also included in its entirety on Neil Young Archives Volume II: 1972–1976 but was also released on its own earlier in 2020. As of 2019, Young has launched a subscription website and application where all of his music is available to stream in high resolution audio. The Neil Young Archives also include his newspaper, The Times-Contrarian; The Hearse Theater, which shows limited runs of concert films and rare footage; and photos and memorabilia throughout his career.    Box sets     Volume I: 1963–1972  The first volume, The Archives Vol. 1 1963–1972, was released on June 2, 2009. Covering Young's early years with The Squires and Buffalo Springfield, it also includes cuts, demos, outtakes and alternate versions of songs from his albums Neil Young, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, After the Gold Rush, and Harvest, as well as tracks he recorded with both Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young during this time. Also included in the set are several live discs, as well as (on the Blu-Ray/DVD versions) a copy of the long out-of-print film Journey Through the Past, directed by Young in the early 1970s. Volume I was released as a set of 10 Blu-ray discs in order to present high resolution audio as well as accompanying visual documentation.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Which film came out first, The Love Route or Engal Aasan?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\n\"My Love\" is the first single by British DJ and record producer Route 94, featuring vocals by Jess Glynne. It was released in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2014, through Rinse Recordings. The song topped the UK Singles Chart, peaked at number 12 on the Irish Singles Chart and also charted in Belgium. The song was written by Glynne and Route 94, and produced by Route 94.\nGlynne's previous single, \"Rather Be\" with Clean Bandit, topped the UK chart the previous month. The song and an acoustic version appear on the deluxe edition of her album I Cry When I Laugh. The Route 94 version has since become a 3× Platinum record in the UK and the acoustic version has separately received a silver certification.\nThe song was sampled by rapper Lil Keed on \"Proud of Me\", featuring Young Thug, released in 2019. The track was also sampled by rapper Yo Gotti on \"Fuck Em\", which was released in 2015.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"My Love\" is a deep house song heavily influenced by 1990s Eurodance.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nRobert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review, stating:\n\n\"The latest producer-turned-frontman poised to take over the charts seemingly out of nowhere is Route 94; a Rinse FM-signed wonderkid who has shot through the ranks after receiving praise from Radio 1's Annie Mac as well as D'n'B DJs Skream and Benga. What's more, his mysterious alias actually holds meaning: it's the US highway that links Chicago – the home of house music – and Detroit, the birthplace of techno. Naturally, what will almost certainly be his breakthrough hit 'My Love' lands somewhere in the middle on the deep house pH spectrum, its heady piano thuds and gauzy electro glow offset by the radio friendly vocals of Jess Glynne, who featured on Clean Bandit's recent chart topper 'Rather Be'. And while you'd think the latter's recent success would have satisfied the public's appetite for chart-friendly house, we suspect its reign is far from over yet.\" \n\n\n== Chart performance ==\nThe song debuted at number one for one week on the UK Singles Chart, dethroning Pharrell Williams's single \"Happy\" and also was number one on the UK Dance Chart, dethroning Clean Bandit's single \"Rather Be\", which also features Glynne, from that position with first-week sales of 120,770. It was also successful in mainland Europe, peaking within the top ten in five other countries, peaking at number two on the Euro Digital Songs chart, behind Pharrell Williams, for one week.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA music video directed by Ryan Staake to accompany the release of \"My Love\" was first released onto YouTube on 27 January 2014 at a total length of three minutes and eleven seconds and was filmed in infrared. It follows a young man (Jon Fleming) as he enters a club, dances with a young woman (Lorena Sarria), leaves with her, they embrace in the rain and later at her house it is implied that they have sex. She then showers and he leaves. Just before the video ends, it turns back to normal colour and the young man is shown walking out in the rain. The video was taken down after more than 363,000,000 views. As of January 2022, the video is now back online.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Charts and certifications ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References == The Love Route is a 1915 American Western silent film directed and written by Allan Dwan based upon a play by Edward Henry Peple.

Rowan Tyler Jones (born 21 May 1993), known by his stage name Route 94, is an English record producer and remixer from Richmond, London. Initially producing dubstep as Dream, Jones worked with the likes of Skream, Benga and Katy B. He then began producing house music. His single \"My Love\" was a commercial success, reaching number one in three charts.\n\n\n== Music career ==\n\n\n=== 2010–2012: Dream and early career ===\nIn 2010, Jones began to produce dubstep as Dream. Three of his songs were uploaded by UKF Dubstep, and his songs were supported by several big names including Chase & Status and Skrillex who released the Dream EP This Isn't House on his label Owsla.\n\n\n=== 2012–present: Route 94 and commercial breakthrough ===\nOn 26 July 2012, Jones created social network accounts under the name Route 94 after getting his dubplates played on Skream and Benga's Radio 1 show. He explained that the moniker Route 94 came from the name of the road that runs from Chicago to Detroit, which is the birthplace of house and techno music. The Dream accounts were subsequently deleted at the time. He denied rumours of being Dream, using simply a logo and not revealing his name or face. This sparked interest from music blogs such as Fact, who made guesses as to his identity. It has since emerged that they are the same person; Jones has revealed the face of Route 94 and has been credited on albums. Throughout 2013 he produced remixes for Katy B, Skream, Storm Queen and an unreleased remix for Example as well as co-producing \"Smile\" from Benga's third studio album Chapter II.\nThe debut EP under the new alias, titled Fly 4 Life, was released on 17 June 2013 on his eponymous record label. He later signed to Rinse. In September 2013, BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra began to play his debut single \"My Love\", featuring Jess Glynne. MistaJam added it to his Inbox:Fresh feature and it featured on Annie Mac's 2013 mix compilation. Its release date was announced as 2 March 2014, and it became added to Radio 1's A List for frequent airplay. Jones produced \"Everything\", a track from Katy B's second studio album, Little Red.\nGlynne found her commercial breakthrough in 2014 with the Clean Bandit song \"Rather Be\", which topped the UK Singles Chart. This helped \"My Love\" gain exposure, and the song topped the UK Singles Chart, UK Dance Chart and Scottish Singles Chart upon entering the charts.\nFollowing the success of \"My Love\", Jones released his second Route 94 EP Misunderstood on 23 July 2014.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Extended plays ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n==== As lead artist ====\n\n\n==== Promotional singles ====\n\n\n=== Other appearances ===\n\n\n=== Remixes ===\n\n\n=== Production credits ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website Donald William Crisp (27 July 1882 – 25 May 1974) was an English film actor as well as an early producer, director and screenwriter. His career lasted from the early silent film era into the 1960s. He won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1942 for his performance in How Green Was My Valley.    Early life  Donald Crisp was born George William Crisp in Bow, London, in a family home on 27 July 1882. He was the youngest of ten children (four boys and six girls) born to Elizabeth (née Christy) and James Crisp, a labourer. He was educated locally and in 1901 was living with his parents and working as a driver of a horse-drawn vehicle. Crisp made a number of claims about his early life that were eventually proven false decades after his death. He claimed that he was born in 1880 in Aberfeldy in Perthshire, Scotland, and even went so far as to maintain a Scottish accent throughout his life in Hollywood. In fact, he had no connections to Scotland, but in 1996, a plaque commemorating him was unveiled by Scottish comedian Jimmy Logan in Crisp's supposed hometown of Aberfeldy. He claimed on alternative occasions that his father was a cattle farmer, a country doctor or a royal physician to King Edward VII. He also claimed that he was educated at Eton and Oxford, and that he served as a trooper in the 10th Hussars in the Boer War.    Early career   While travelling on the SS Carmania to the United States in July 1906, Crisp's singing talents during a ship's concert caught the attention of opera impresario John C. Fisher, who immediately offered him a job with his company. Crisp spent his first year in New York City in the Grand Opera, and the following year as a stage director. It was while touring with the company in the United States and Cuba that Crisp first became interested in the theatre. By 1910, Crisp, now using the name Donald (he retained George as a middle name), was working as a stage manager for the renowned entertainer, composer, playwright and director George M. Cohan. It was during this time he met and befriended film director D.W. Griffith. When Griffith ventured west, to seek his fortune in Hollywood in 1912, Crisp accompanied him.  From 1908 to 1930, Crisp, in addition to directing dozens of films, also appeared in nearly 100 silent films, though many in bit or small parts. One notable exception was his casting by Griffith as General Ulysses S. Grant in Griffith's landmark film The Birth of a Nation in 1915. Another was his role in Griffith's 1919 film Broken Blossoms as \"Battling Burrows\", the brutal and abusive father of the film's heroine, Lucy Burrows (played by Lillian Gish; the actress was only 11 years his junior).    Director  Crisp worked as an assistant to Griffith for several years and learned much during this time from Griffith, an early master of film story telling who was influential in advancing a number of early techniques, such as cross cutting in editing his films. This experience fostered a similar passion in Crisp to become a director in his own right. His first directing credit was Little Country Mouse, made in 1914. Many directors (and actors) would find themselves turning out a dozen or more films in a single year at this time. Over the next fifteen years, Crisp directed some 70 films in all, most notably The Navigator (1924) with Buster Keaton and Don Q, Son of Zorro (1925) with Douglas Fairbanks. When asked later by an interviewer why he eventually gave up directing and returned full-time to acting, Crisp commented that directing had become extremely wearisome because he was so often called upon, if not forced, to do favours for studio chiefs by agreeing to employ their relatives in his films. His final directorial effort was the film The Runaway Bride (1930).    Military career  Between working for Griffith and other producers, along with his many acting roles, Crisp managed to return to the U.K., serving in British army intelligence during the First World War (1914–1918). Crisp became an American citizen in 1930; during the Second World War (1939–1945), he served in the United States Army Reserve, attaining the rank of colonel.    Return to acting   With the advent of \"talkies\", Crisp abandoned directing and devoted himself entirely to acting after 1930. He became a much sought after character actor.

All the Love may refer to: Jumbo Love is a very long 76-metre (249 ft) sport climbing route, on remote limestone cliffs on Clark Mountain in the Mojave Desert.  Bolted by American climber Randy Leavitt in the 1990s, he invited Chris Sharma to attempt it in 2007.  When Sharma completed the first free ascent on September 11, 2008, the route became the first-ever rock climb in history to have a confirmed grade of 9b (5.15b), and it remains an important route in the history of rock climbing.   The route has been repeated, and its grade confirmed, by a number of subsequent climbers, including French climber Seb Bouin, who made the fourth ascent on October 25, 2022.  Bouin followed up his ascent by adding a direct start to the route on November 1, 2022, to create a route called Suprême Jumbo Love, which at 9b+ (5.15c) became North America's hardest climbing route and only the sixth 9b+ sport climbing route in history.    History  The route was bolted by American Randy Leavitt in the late 1990s, who envisaged it being a 3-pitch climb. Leavitt failed to complete the route and invited Chris Sharma to try it.  Sharma spent 2007 with fellow American climber Ethan Pringle working the route, which Sharma envisioned as a huge 76-metre (249 ft) long single-pitch climb. In 2008, Pringle was injured and Sharma, living below the cliff (the \"Third Tier\" crag) for weeks, made the first ascent on September 11, 2008. Sharma named the route Jumbo Love in recognition of Leavitt's neighboring route, Jumbo Pumping Hate. At the time of Sharma's ascent, Jumbo Love was one of several sport climbing routes that were proposed at the grade of 9b (5.15b). Fred Rouhling's controversial 1995 route, Akira, was downgraded to 9a after its first repeat by Seb Bouin in 2020. Bernabe Fernandez's equally controversial 2003 route, Chilam Balam, was later downgraded to 9a+/b after repeats by Adam Ondra and Bouin. Tommy Caldwell's 2003 route, Flex Luthor, always had caveats due to the extreme level of rock erosion (including from Caldwell himself), and was regraded to 9a+ (5.15a) by Jonathan Siegrist in 2022. Dani Andrada's 2007 route, Ali Hulk Sit Start Extension, was downgraded to 9a+/b by Alex Garriga in 2021, and further downgraded to 9a by Dani Moreno in 2023. Andrada's September 2008 route, Delincuente Natural, was also downgraded to 9a on its first repeat by Jonathan Flor in 2021. Sharma would be the only climber of this \"first potential 9b\" group that would go on to climb further consensus 9b graded sport climbing routes, which he did with Golpe de Estado (2008), and Neanderthal (2009); he also went on to climb 9b+ (5.15c) with La Dura Dura in 2013. Neither Rouhling, Fernandez, Andrada, or Caldwell, would climb another route with a claim of being at, or above, the grade of 9b. The first repeat of Jumbo Love was completed almost seven years later by Ethan Pringle on May 17, 2015; his climb (and Sharma's 2008 ascent) was captured in the 2016 Reel Rock documentary film Reel Rock: Jumbo Love. American climber Jonathan Siegrist completed the third ascent on May 17, 2018, and French climber Seb Bouin made the fourth ascent on October 25, 2022. Despite being able to use kneepads, Bouin felt the 9b grade was unaffected, saying: \"Jumbo Love is not just a hard line, it's a whole adventure\"; at the time, Bouin had climbed 9b/9b+ and 9b+    Suprême Jumbo Love  From 2010 to 2013, Sharma tried to add a direct start to Jumbo Love but ended up eventually abandoning the project; Leavitt told Climbing that the direct start could create a new route that was closer to grade 5.15c (9b+). After completing the fourth ascent of Jumbo Love, Seb Bouin immediately began working on the direct start, which he named Suprême Jumbo Love.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

The population was 10,666 at the 2010 census. The city is situated along the Wabash River in the county seat of Wabash County. Wabash is notable as claiming to be the first electrically lighted city in the world, which was inaugurated on March 31, 1880. However, closer inspection of the reference shows only the court house grounds were lighted. It is also home to the historic Eagles Theatre, Paradise Spring Treaty Grounds (1826), the Wabash and Erie Canal, Presbyterian Church (1880), and Disciples of Christ Christian Church (1865).    Etymology  The name Wabash derives from a Miami-Illinois term for \"water over white stones.\" The Miami name reflected the clarity of the river in Huntington County, Indiana, where the river bottom is limestone.    History  The first settlers to arrive in Wabash was in 1829 as a result of the treaty of Paradise Spring. The town of Wabash was platted in the spring of 1834 by Col. Hugh Hanna and Col. David Burr. The community was designated as the county seat, and it was incorporated in 1834. The town prospered due to its proximity to the Wabash and Erie Canal. In 1870 the Wabash County Courthouse and most of downtown was destroyed in a fire. However, the resilience of the city led Wabash to recover. The construction of the Big Four Railway brought even more growth to the small town but led to the neglect of the canal. Wabash used a new type of carbon arc light invented by Charles Brush in 1870. On March 31, 1880, four 3,000-candle power lamps were suspended from the top of the courthouse. Two telegraph wires ran from the lamps to the courthouse basement, where they were connected to a generator powered by a 12-horsepower steam engine to provide power  The James M. Amoss Building, Downtown Wabash Historic District, East Wabash Historic District, First Christian Church, Honeywell Memorial Community Center, Honeywell Studio, McNamee-Ford House, North Wabash Historic District, West Wabash Historic District, and Solomon Wilson Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.    Media  The Wabash Free Trader was published in Wabash from 1871 to 1876. The Wabash Weekly Courier was published from 1876 until 1887.    Geography   The Wabash River runs through the town, on its way towards Peru, where it splits creating a series of islands, and where the sandbars are quite common on this stretch. According to the 2010 census, Wabash has a total area of 9.128 square miles (23.64 km2), of which 8.89 square miles (23.02 km2) (or 97.39%) is land and 0.238 square miles (0.62 km2) (or 2.61%) is water.    Climate     Demographics     2010 census  As of the census of 2010, there were 10,666 people, 4,465 households, and 2,805 families living in the city. The population density was 1,199.8 inhabitants per square mile (463.2/km2). There were 5,068 housing units at an average density of 570.1 units per square mile (220.1 units/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 96.3% White, 0.4% African American, 1.0% Native American, 0.5% Asian, 0.6% from other races, and 1.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.0% of the population. There were 4,465 households, of which 29.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.7% were married couples living together, 12.5% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.7% had a male householder with no wife present, and 37.2% were non-families. 32.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.88. The median age in the city was 41.3 years. Wabash College is a private liberal arts men's college in Crawfordsville, Indiana. Founded in 1832 by several Dartmouth College graduates and Midwestern leaders, it enrolls nearly 900 students. The college offers an undergraduate liberal arts curriculum in three academic divisions with 39 majors. As of 2020, it is one of only three private, non-religious, all-male colleges in the United States.    History  The college was initially named The Wabash Teachers Seminary and Manual Labor College, a name shortened to its current form by 1851. Many of the founders were Presbyterian ministers, yet nevertheless they believed that Wabash should be independent and non-sectarian. Patterning it after the liberal arts colleges of New England, they resolved \"that the institution be at first a classical and English high school, rising into a college as soon as the wants of the country demand.\"  Among these ministers was Caleb Mills, who became Wabash College's first faculty member. He would come to be known as the father of the Indiana public education system. Elihu W. Baldwin, the first president of the college, served from 1835 until 1840. He came from a church in New York City and accepted the presidency even though he knew that Wabash was at that time threatened with bankruptcy. After his death, he was succeeded by Charles White, a graduate of Dartmouth College and the brother-in-law of Rev. Edmund Otis Hovey (1801–1877), a professor at the college. Joseph F. Tuttle, who became president of Wabash College in 1862 and served for 30 years, worked with his administrators to improve town-gown relations in Crawfordsville. Gronert described him \"an eloquent preacher, a sound administrator, and an astute handler of public relations.\" He was the namesake of the former Tuttle Grade School in Crawfordsville (1906), the former Tuttle Junior High School, and the former Tuttle Middle School (1960). Scott E. Feller, Dean of the college from 2014 to 2020 and chemistry professor at Wabash since 1998, became the 17th President of Wabash College on July 1, 2020.  In the early 1900s, the college closed its \"Preparatory School\", which prepared incoming students from less-rigorous rural high schools that lacked the courses required for entrance to the college. During World War II, Wabash College was one of 131 colleges and universities that offered students a path to a Navy commission as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program. In 1996, Wabash became the first college in America to stage Tony Kushner's Angels in America.    Academics     Curriculum  Wabash College's curriculum is divided into three: Division I, Division II, and Division III representing the natural sciences, humanities and arts, and social sciences respectively. Wabash offers 27 academic programs as majors and 31 accompanying minors. Its most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:  Rhetoric (21) Economics (20) History (18) Religion/Religious Studies (15) Experimental Psychology (14) English Language and Literature (11) Biology/Biological Sciences (10)    Comprehensive exams  Seniors at Wabash College take a three-day comprehensive exam in their major subject area. There are two days of written exams and one day of oral exams. The two days of written exams differ by major, but the oral exams are relatively uniform. A senior meets with three professors, one from his major, another from his minor, and a third professor who represents an outside perspective, and can be from any discipline. Over the course of an hour a senior answers questions from the professors which can relate to anything during his studies at Wabash. A senior must pass the comprehensive examinations in order to be eligible for a degree.    Student life     Student culture and traditions  On \"Ringing In Saturday\", incoming students are addressed by the dean of students, the dean of admissions, the president of the alumni association, and the college president and are \"rung in\" by the president, using the same bell that Caleb Mills used to call students to class. On Homecoming weekend, students are given the opportunity to show how well they know the college fight song (Old Wabash) during \"Chapel Sing\".    Student government  The student government, referred to collectively as the Student Body of Wabash College, comprises executive, legislative, and judicial branches.    Student organizations  Student organizations at Wabash receive funding and recognition from the Student Senate. This funding in turn comes from a student activities fee, which every attendee of the college must pay each semester. Below is a list of selective and agricultural high schools run by the NSW Department of Education. Entry to these schools is managed by the department's Selective High School and Opportunity Class Placement Unit. In years before, prospective students sit the Selective High School Test during May when students are in Year 6 (in former years March) and are allocated places at selective schools according to their profile mark, which is out of 300, which comprises both exam and school marks, however there is no more marks being provided to applicants. Students may list up to three preferred selective or agricultural high schools they wish to enter.\nA number of other government and non-government high schools also select their students based on merit; these include, for example, creative and performing arts schools, and also some private schools.\n\n\n== Schools ==\n\n1 Previously known as Manly Boys High School (1954–1983) and Manly High School (1983–2002).\n\n2 Year of amalgamation of Dover Heights High School and Vaucluse High School.\n\n3 Previously known as Malvina High School (1965–2001) and foundation year for selective stream.\n\n\n== Creative and performing arts high schools ==\nThe New South Wales Department of Education operates creative and performing arts high schools in communities throughout the state for students who wish to work with creative arts when they grow up.

The Wabash River  (French: Ouabache) is a  503-mile-long (810 km) river that drains most of the state of Indiana, and a significant part of Illinois, in the United States. It flows from the headwaters in Ohio, near the Indiana border, then southwest across northern Indiana turning south near the Illinois border, where the southern portion forms the Indiana-Illinois border before flowing into the Ohio River. It is the largest northern tributary of the Ohio River and third largest overall, behind the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers. From the dam near Huntington, Indiana, to its terminus at the Ohio River, the Wabash flows freely for 411 miles (661 km)  The Tippecanoe River, White River, Embarras River and Little Wabash River are major tributaries. The river's name comes from a Miami word meaning \"water over white stones\", as its bottom is white limestone, now obscured by mud. The Wabash is the state river of Indiana, and subject of the state song \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" by Paul Dresser. Two counties (in Indiana and Illinois); eight townships in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio; one Illinois precinct, one city, one town, two colleges, one high school, one canal, one former class I railroad, several bridges and avenues are all named for the river itself while four US Navy warships are either named for the river or the numerous battles that took place on or near it.    Etymology  The name Wabash is an English transliteration spelling of the French name for the river, Ouabache. French traders had adopted the  Miami-Illinois word for the river, waapaahšiiki, meaning 'it shines white', 'pure white', or 'water over white stones', and attempted to spell it according to their own phonetic system. The Miami name expressed the clarity of the river in Huntington County, Indiana, where the river bottom is limestone.    Geology  As the Laurentide Ice Sheet began to retreat from present-day Northern Indiana and Northwest Ohio between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, it receded into three distinct lobes. The eastern or Erie Lobe sat atop and behind the Fort Wayne Moraine. Meltwater from the glacier fed into two ice-marginal streams, which became the St. Joseph and St. Marys rivers. Their combined discharge was probably the primary source of water for the proglacial Wabash River system. As the Erie Lobe of the glacier continued to retreat, its meltwater was temporarily trapped between the ice front to the east and the Fort Wayne Moraine to the west, and formed proglacial Lake Maumee, the ancestor of modern Lake Erie. Around 11,000 years ago the waters of Lake Maumee became deep enough that it breached a \"sag\" or weak spot in the Fort Wayne Moraine. This caused a catastrophic draining of the lake, which in turn scoured a 1 to 2 mi (1.6 to 3.2 km) wide valley known as the Wabash-Erie Channel or \"sluiceway\".  The Little (Wabash) River flows through this channel. U.S. 24 traverses it between Fort Wayne and Huntington. The valley is the largest topographical feature in Allen County, Indiana. When the ice melted completely from the region, new outlets for Lake Maumee's water opened up at elevations lower than the Wabash-Erie Channel. While the St. Joseph and St. Marys Rivers continued to flow through the channel, Lake Maumee no longer did. Now a low-lying, probably marshy bit of terrain lay in between. It is not known for certain when, but at some point in the distant past the St. Joseph and St. Marys Rivers jumped their banks and flooded the marshy ground of the Fort Wayne Outlet. The discharge of this unusual flood was enough to cut across the outlet and come into contact with the headwaters of the Maumee River. Once this happened, the flood waters rushed to the east into the Maumee River, and their erosive force was enough that the new channel cut across the Fort Wayne Outlet into the Maumee River since it was at a lower elevation than that of the sluiceway. This meant that when the flood waters receded, the sluiceway was permanently abandoned by the two rivers. As a result of capturing them both, the Maumee was converted from a minor creek to a large river. Once again, river waters flowed through the Fort Wayne Outlet, but now they flowed eastward, toward Lake Erie, instead of westward. The Ottawa High School and Junior High School, located at 526 and 506 S. Main St. respectively, are the historic former high school and junior high school in Ottawa, Kansas. The high school was built in 1917, while the junior high school was built from 1927 to 1928; an enclosed hallway connecting the two buildings was built with the junior high school. The high school was the first school in Ottawa to be built solely as a high school and the eighth school built in Ottawa. George P. Washburn& Son designed the high school in the Collegiate Gothic style. When the junior high school was constructed ten years later, the firm, by then known as Washburn& Stookey, designed the building in the same style as the high school. In 1966, a new high school was built for the upper three classes of students; the freshman class moved to the building in 1976, and the old high school and junior high school became a middle school. The two buildings were connected by a multi-purpose room in the same year. The middle school later vacated the building. The school was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 6, 2000.

It is approximately 9 km (6 mi) by road south-east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Randwick.\n\n\n== History ==\nMatraville is named in honour of James Matra (1746–1806), an American sailor and diplomat, who was a midshipman on the voyage by Captain James Cook to Botany Bay in 1770. Matra was born in New York, but later settled in England. Matra had walked over the area with Cook and his close friend, botanist Joseph Banks. Matra had proposed to the British government that it establish a colony at Botany Bay in 1783, and settle dispossessed American Loyalists who had to leave the United States after the American War of Independence. Matra offered to be its 'Conductor and Governor'. The Pitt administration concurred with Matra's proposal but declined to offer him the government of the intended colony. Instead he was given the post of Consul at Tangier, where he remained until his death in 1806.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\nLandmarks include Heffron Park, a large reserve bordering Maroubra, formerly the site of a naval stores base in World War II.\nEastern Suburbs Memorial Park sits along the southern border of the suburb and incorporates Botany Cemetery, Eastern Suburbs Crematorium and Pioneer Park.

[CC-By-SA]\nSatellite Images of Matraville A sports school (Russian: Детско-Юношеская Спортивная Школа, ДЮСШ) is a type of educational institution for children that originated in the Soviet Union. Sports schools were the basis of the powerful system of physical culture (fitness) and sports education in the USSR and the Eastern Bloc, particularly East Germany. The main features of this system remain in the system of sports education in Russia and other post-Soviet states, and also became the basis of similar systems in other countries, one of the most powerful ones at the present time being that of the People's Republic of China. Many legendary athletes, such as Nikolai Andrianov, Nellie Kim, Alexander Popov, Viktor Krovopuskov, Vladislav Tretiak, Valeri Kharlamov, Anatoly Alyabyev and Sergey Bubka started their path to Olympic success from Soviet sports schools. They are also found in Asia, in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Australia.    Establishment and early years  The system of sports schools was founded in the 1930s. In 1934, Young Pioneers Stadium was built in Moscow, the first specialized sports extracurricular institution in the USSR. In the same year the first children's collective was established by Dynamo sports society; this was a prototype of sports schools by sports societies. In 1935–1936, the first sports schools were opened in Moscow, Leningrad and other cities of the USSR; they were created and functioned on the basis of regulations, approved by the Central Soviet of Sports Societies and Organizations of the USSR. By the 1940s dozens of schools functioned in the USSR by Dynamo sports society, Spartak sports society, CDKA, sports societies of Trade Unions, OSOAVIAKHIM and in the system of education. After the Great Patriotic War, sports schools were frequently reorganized, transferred from the jurisdiction of sports societies to that of the system of education and vice versa. Separate from these were two national sports universities under government operation: the Leningrad and Moscow Sports Institutes, which were the major sports institutions for adult level national athletes.    Olympic Reserve specialized (complex) schools  After the USSR joined as a full member of the International Olympic Committee in 1951, Specialized Children and Youth (Sports) Schools of the Olympic Reserve (Russian: Специализированная Детско-Юношеская (Спортивная) Школа Олимпийского Резерва, СДЮ(С)ШОР) began to be opened to prepare young athletes for the sports of highest achievements. The number of such sports schools grew, as did the number of sports disciplines within sports schools. They included not only Olympic sports, but also national sports disciplines as well as tourism, orienteering, and other sports. As an alternative there is also Complex Specialized Children and Youth School of the Olympic Reserve (Ukrainian: Комплексна Спеціалізована Дитячо-Юнацька Школа Олімпійського Резерву, КСДЮШОР).    Schools of Higher Sports Mastery  Aside of regular sports schools and specialized schools of Olympic Reserve, there are also schools of higher sports mastery (Ukrainian: Школа вищої спортивної майстерності, ШВСМ).    Regional boarding schools of sports profile (Schools of Olympic Reserve)  Before 1989 in the Soviet Union existed a network of regional boarding schools of sports profile (Russian: ОШИСП, Областная школа-интернат спортивного профиля). Children live, study and receive advanced sports training there. Sports boarding schools can be either one-sport-oriented or multisports. In those schools children spend most of their time off studying practicing sports or perfecting certain skills. In 1989 all sports boarding schools were converted to schools of Olympic Reserve, UOR (Russian: училище олимпийского резерва, УОР).    Structure  Sports schools were compatible with the administrative division of the country: there were District, City, Oblast, Central, Republican sports schools. To enter sports school, a child could have a recommendation from one's secondary school; children were also invited to come into a certain sports school for the selection during lessons in an ordinary school, or they could come for the selection on their own initiative.

Matraville Sports High School is a member of the NSW Sports High Schools Association.    History  In the years consequent upon the Second World War, South Eastern suburbs of Sydney saw increasing population growth and, as a result, increasing demands for infrastructure to assist that growth. At the time, the closest high schools in the area were South Sydney Boys' High School and Maroubra Junction Girls' High School. As a result, the local member and Minister for Education, Bob Heffron, made the decision to establish a new high school in Matraville. The site on the corner of Anzac Parade and Franklin Street in southern Matraville was secured by the Department of Education in 1957.  The original school site was covered in virgin Banksia scrub growing on low sand hills bordered by houses on Mitchell Street. The southern part of Matraville became the suburb of Chifley in 1964. At Heffron's instigation, the new school would be co-educational, in a period when the vast majority of NSW secondary schools were sex segregated. Prior to 1960, Robert E. Mobbs, a former Second World War army officer who had also helped establish Fairfield Boys' High and Arthur Phillip High, was appointed as the school's first headmaster. However, a lack of funding restricted the start of construction and it was not until well after the first 200 students had been accepted in 1960 that building began. Therefore, the first students were housed at Daceyville Public School and the 1961 intake of students were sent to Gardeners Road Public School. Designed by the New South Wales Government Architect, in February 1961 the NSW Department of Public Works awarded the contract of £247,740 to build stages I and II of the school to Monier Builders Pty Ltd of Villawood. Construction was finished by early 1962, which allowed the students to finally move in, and was officially opened by the local Member of Parliament for Maroubra and NSW Premier, Bob Heffron, on 27 September 1963. The school soon generated a reputation for excellence in sports, with a particular emphasis on rugby that was developed by sports master and coach, Geoff Mould. The Waratah Shield, the state knockout competition for Rugby Union, was won by Matraville in 1972, 1976, 1977, 1983 and 2007 and the ARL Schoolboy Cup was also won in 2007. In recognition of the school's excellence in this area, in December 2001, Matraville High was re-established as a specialist sports high, thus becoming \"Matraville Sports High School\".    School details  In 2020, there were 344 students enrolled in the school from Years 7 through to Year 12. Of these, 115 students were girls and 229 were boys. The school has an enrolment of 35% Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and 14% of students have a language background other than English. There were approximately 40 teaching staff at the school.

        "answer": "November 28, 1919",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: What is the date of birth of the director of film Wandering Fires?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nMaurice S. Campbell (October 7, 1869 or 1870 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – October 16, 1942) was an American journalist, Broadway producer, Army officer, silent film director, and enforcer of Prohibition in a long and varied career.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCampbell was born the fifth child of Samuel Campbell (1829–1920), a candymaker, and his wife Mary. Shortly after his birth the family moved to Leadville, Colorado where Samuel made money in the mining boom there. After the death of Campbell's mother, his father remarried, to Caroline Brooke (1840–1905) of Lower Pottsgrove Township, Pennsylvania, and the family lived, first in Philadelphia and by 1883 on the Brooke farm. His father eventually had a 30-room mansion built on the property.\nCampbell graduated from New York University in 1889 with a degree in veterinary medicine. Instead of establishing a practice, Campbell went into journalism, working for the New York Herald, covering the Spanish–American War, and later becoming the assistant city desk editor.\n\n\n== Show business ==\nIn 1896 Campbell married actress Henrietta Crosman and moved into the world of show business. He became a press agent and then a writer, producer, and director. Between 1902 and 1913 he produced many Broadway plays, most of them featuring his wife, including the only Broadway production of Henrik Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken in 1905 and Where There's a Will (1910), which Campbell himself adopted from a French comedy by Paul Gavault and Robert Charvay; it ran 64 performances and was briefly revived in 1939.\nCampbell served in the US Army 4th Division during World War I, reaching the rank of major; he probably served as a veterinarian.\n\nAfter the war Campbell became a director in the new silent film industry. Most of his work was done for Realart Pictures, a production unit associated with Adolph Zukor's Famous Players–Lasky studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures. His output included at least 14 films between 1920 and 1925, including Oh, Lady, Lady (1920), starring Bebe Daniels in a version of a popular play by P. G. Wodehouse, An Amateur Devil (1920), Burglar Proof (1920), She Couldn't Help It (1920), First Love (1921), The Speed Girl (1921), Two Weeks with Pay (1921), The March Hare (1921), Ducks and Drakes (1921), One Wild Week (1921), Through a Glass Window (1922), Midnight (1922), The Exciters (1923), and Wandering Fires (1925). Most of his films have been lost.\nWhile in Hollywood Campbell, on behalf of the Motion Picture Directors Association, managed an elaborate gala production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream in the Hollywood Bowl on October 7, 1922 as a benefit for the Actors Fund of America. The production included the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra under director Frederic Richard Sullivan.\n\n\n== Prohibition ==\nIn 1926 Campbell, who was an active supporter of Prohibition, became Supervisor of the Great Lakes and North Atlantic Zones for the Bureau of Prohibition, the federal agency charged with enforcing that law. In June 1927 he was appointed the administrator for Prohibition District 2 of the state of New York, a district which included New York City – a center of opposition to Prohibition.\nCampbell's enthusiastic enforcement efforts, including a massive series of nightclub raids in New York City while New York state's \"wet\" governor, Al Smith, was being nominated at the Democratic national convention, were politically embarrassing to Republican party leaders. In July 1930 he was reassigned to upstate New York and resigned in protest. By then Campbell had concluded that enforcement was impossible and a cause of corruption and crime.\nCampbell accused Assistant Treasury Secretary Seymour Lowman and others of asking him to reduce Prohibition enforcement in New York City for political reasons, publishing a series of articles in the New York World about the matter and later complaining directly to President Hoover about Lowman's conduct. In 1931 Campbell became the editor of a new anti-Prohibition publication, \"Repeal\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nCampbell and Crosman had a son, Maurice Jr., in 1897. They moved to Pelham Manor, New York in 1913 and lived there the rest of their lives, except for Campbell's war service and his time in Hollywood in the early 1920s.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMaurice S. Campbell at IMDb The Fionavar Tapestry is a book series of fantasy novels by Canadian author Guy Gavriel Kay, published between 1984 and 1986.

Arthurian characters  The story borrows elements of medieval literature its plot, particularly King Arthur, who is known to the characters in the books as \"The Warrior\", Lancelot and Guinevere. Parts of the story focuses on the reenactment of the Arthurian stories.    The Deities  The Weaver is the creator of the tapestry, the fabric of time, causality and existence, and all the worlds within the trilogy. They are described by the inhabitants of Fionavar as \"hands-off\" deity, who acts only to bring about events required by fate (the \"weave of the Tapestry\") and who otherwise does not interfere with free will. It is mentioned that The Weaver's only law is that the gods cannot act directly upon the Tapestry without being summoned and bound by mortals to do so, an act that always requires sacrifice, a rule which is enforced by other gods if it is violated. The gods can, however, act indirectly by choosing mortal champions and bestowing gifts and powers upon them. Mörnir is the lord of the summer tree, the patron god of the royal house of the High Kingdom of Brennin. He is described to be a sky god who is connected with ravens and oak trees. Dana is the goddess of the earth and the moon and written as the \"mother, sister, daughter, bride of the God\".

Her name is directly inspired by the Irish goddess Danu. Ceinwen is a goddess of the wood and the hunt who is revered by the Dalrei, a tribal people of the plains of Fionavar. She is seen to kill all men of Fionavar who witness her hunting. Cernan of the Beasts is the god of animals and wild things who is also revered by the Dalrei. He is characterised to be crowned with the antlers of a stag. His name is derived from the Celtic deity Cernunnos. Macha and Nemain are twin goddesses of war who are directly inspired by the Irish mythological figures associated with The Morrigan. Liranan is the god of the sea, whose name is derived from the Celtic deity Manannan mac Lir. Owein and the Wild Hunt is a group of once-mortal kings who together comprise a cosmic force of randomness and wildness; their existence is said to be necessary for mortals to have free will. In the books, they are described to be bound to the Cave of the Sleepers and can be woken and summoned by the artifact Owein's Horn but must be led by a mortal child who becomes one of them and rides with them. The group is inspired by the Wild Hunt of European folklore. Rakoth Maugrim is the renegade god, characterised as the enemy of the Weaver. Wandering Fires is a 1925 silent film drama produced and directed by Maurice Campbell and stars Constance Bennett.

Guy Gavriel Kay  (born November 7, 1954) is a Canadian writer of fantasy fiction. The majority of his novels take place in fictional settings that resemble real places during real historical periods, such as Constantinople during the reign of Justinian I or Spain during the time of El Cid. Kay has expressed a preference to avoid genre categorization of these works as historical fantasy. As of 2022, Kay has published 15 novels and a book of poetry. As of 2018, his fiction has been translated into at least 22 languages. Kay is also a qualified lawyer in Canada.    Biography  Kay was born in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, in 1954. He was raised and educated in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and received a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Manitoba in 1975. When Christopher Tolkien needed an assistant to edit his father J. R. R. Tolkien's unpublished work, he chose Kay, then a student of philosophy at the University of Manitoba, because of a family connection. Kay moved to Oxford in 1974 to assist Christopher in editing The Silmarillion. Kay returned to Canada in 1975 to pursue a law degree at the University of Toronto, which he obtained in 1978; he was called to the bar of Ontario in 1981. Kay became principal writer and an associate producer for the CBC Radio series The Scales of Justice, and continued as principal writer when the series transferred to television as Scales of Justice. Kay's first novel, the portal fantasy The Summer Tree that serves as the first volume of his Fionavar Tapestry trilogy, was published in 1984. He subsequently had many other novels published, most of them in the field of historical fantasy. Kay has voiced concerns relative to the decline of individual privacy, the expectation of privacy, and literary privacy. The last principally has to do with the use of real individuals in works of fiction, such as Michael Cunningham's The Hours, partly based on the life of Virginia Woolf, where Woolf features in the novel as one of a number of protagonists.

John Maurice Hardman Campbell  (1891–1973) was a British physician, cardiologist, and medical journal editor.    Biography  After education at Winchester College, J. Maurice Campbell studied at New College, Oxford, where he graduated with a first-class honours degree in physiology. He was awarded a senior demyship at Magdalen College, Oxford and entered in 1914 Guy's Hospital Medical School, where he graduated in 1916 BM BCh (Oxon.). He joined in 1916 the RAMC, served with the rank of captain in Mesopotamia and North Persia, and was twice mentioned in despatches. In June 1919 he was awarded the OBE for his services with a field ambulance. In 1920 Campbell returned to Guy's Hospital as a medical registrar. He graduated DM in 1921 and qualified MRCP in 1921. He spent three years (from 1923 to 1925) in the department of physiology working with E. P. Poulton on oxygen therapy and with Marcus Pembrey. Campbell held from 1923 to 1927 a Beit memorial research fellowship, in 1925 resumed clinical work as a medical registrar, and in 1926 became an assistant physician at Guy's Hospital. He was elected FRCP in 1929.  His early publications included papers on respiratory and gastric physiology, paroxysmal atrial rhythm disturbances, complete heart block, the use of quinidine, the heart in thyroid disease, and the effects of exercise on the heart and digestion. At the National Heart Hospital he began working in 1926 with the cardiologist John Parkinson and in 1930 became there a consultant physician. During WWII Campbell was superintendent of the Emergency Medical Service Hospital, Orpington. At Guy's Hospital he was promoted in 1945 to general physician, and in 1948 became a cardiologist and head of the newly-founded cardiac department.  In 1938, he became the first editor of the British Heart Journal (along with Evan Bedford) which he continued to edit for 20 years until 1958. The Worshipful Company of Clothworkers sponsored a visitor exchange of senior staff members between Guy's Hospital and the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Under this sponsorship Campbell invited in 1947 Alfred Blalock to Guy's Hospital to perform the first \"blue baby operation\" in the UK. Campbell identified a number of patients with cyanotic heart disease as possible candidates for surgery.  This led to an intense period of surgical development and close collaboration with Russell Brock and Charles Baker that would make Guy's Hospital famous for its surgery on congenital heart disease and mitral stenosis. Campbell delivered in 1946 the Lumleian Lectures. In 1958 he retired from active clinical practice but continued to write papers and attend medical conferences. He was president from 1956 to 1960 of the British Cardiac Society and was the chair of the British Heart Foundation upon its inception in 1961. The Royal College of Physicians award him the Moxon medal in 1966. Campbell published in 1935 a book entitled Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson: A Medical Digression and was an active member of the Sherlock Holmes Society of London. In the autumn of 1972 he made a lecture tour of American medical centres. J. Maurice Campbell's father was the mathematician John Edward Campbell. On 28 August 1924 in Nefyn, Caernarfonshire, Maurice Campbell married Ethel Mary Chrimes, a nurse at Guy's Hospital. He was survived by his widow, two sons and three daughters.

The Wandering Fire is a 1986 novel by Canadian fantasy author Guy Gavriel Kay and the second novel of The Fionavar Tapestry trilogy. It follows The Summer Tree.    Plot summary  Six months have passed since the end of The Summer Tree, and Kim is waiting for the dream that will tell her how to summon the Warrior to aid them in their battle against Maugrim.  Jennifer is pregnant with Rakoth Maugrim's child and, surprisingly, is determined to have the baby—aware that Maugrim wanted her dead, she is determined not only to live but to have the child, believing that it will be both an answer and a threat to him.  She and Paul are menaced in their own world by Galadan; Paul, tapping the potent but unreliable power of Mörnir that lives in him since his three nights on the Summer Tree, takes the two of them back to Fionavar.  They arrive safely but the crossing brings on Jennifer's labor.  When the child is born she names him Darien and gives him to Vae and Shahar, the parents of Finn.  Jaelle sends Paul and Jennifer back to their own world. In the spring, Kim and the others go to Stonehenge, where a dream has revealed to Kim she can call on Uther Pendragon to find out where Arthur is buried.  She succeeds in raising Uther and extracting from him the name by which Arthur may be summoned.  Using the Baelrath, she sends the others to Fionavar and herself to Glastonbury Tor, where she summons Arthur with the name Childslayer.  Arthur is bound to answer to this name because of the May Babies, children he had ordered slain in an attempt to forestall Mordred's growing to manhood. Kim and Arthur rejoin the others in Fionavar.  This time, Fionavar is in the midst of an unnatural months-long winter.  Upon meeting Arthur, a flood of memories awakens in Jennifer and she recalls her life as Guinevere.  Unable to break through the walls she created to survive her ordeal in Starkadh, Jennifer retreats to the temple of Dana, relieved that at least there is no Lancelot and so although she cannot love Arthur, at least she won't betray him.  Meanwhile, Darien is growing up unnaturally quickly, like all andain, so Vae, Shahar and Finn move to Ysanne's cottage by the lake.  Darien is a loving little boy and devoted to Finn—but he also hears voices in the storm and sometimes unknowingly flexes the power he inherited from his father, which makes his eyes turn red. On the Plains, the eltor are bogged down in the snow and harried by Galadan's wolves.  The Dalrei do their best to protect the herds but come under attack by an army of urgach mounted on slaug.  Diarmuid and his men, with Dave and Kevin, arrive in time to thwart the initial assault, but it is Tabor, mounted on Imraith-Nimphais, who finally saves them.  Ivor worries that his son's bond with the deadly but beautiful magical beast will weaken Tabor's hold on the real world. Kim, Dave, Levon and a small band make their way to the Cave of the Sleepers and Dave blows Owein's Horn to wake the Wild Hunt.  Owein and seven shadowy kings awaken, but there are nine horses.  Just as the Hunt is about to rampage forth looking for their missing member, Finn arrives and takes his place on the ninth horse: this is his Longest Road, riding with the Wild Hunt. The entire company (except for Paul who remains with Darien) journeys to Gwen Ystrat, a location sacred to the goddess, arriving (by chance?) on Midsummer Eve, or Maidaladan, a night of potent sexual/erotic magic.  Kim, Gereint, Jaelle and the mages discover that Metran, renegade first mage of Brennin, is making the winter on an island; since all the ports are frozen, they cannot get to him to stop him.  Kevin is wounded during a boar hunt which he realizes marks him as belonging to the Goddess.  That night, Midsummer Eve, Diarmuid and Sharra admit their love for each other; meanwhile, Kevin follows Cavall to the cave of Dun Maura where he sacrifices his life to the Goddess, allowing her to intercede and, with the magic unleashed from his sacrifice, end the winter that has been looming over Fionavar. Freed from winter, war begins.  Kim and Brock journey to the mountains where they are attacked by brigands.  The Dalrei are attacked by a vast army of the Dark, and only Dave's summoning of the Wild Hunt by blowing Owein's Horn turns the tide. Maurice Campbell Cornforth (28 October 1909 – 31 December 1980) was a British Marxist philosopher.    Life  Cornforth was born in Willesden, London, in 1909, and educated at University College School, where he was friends with Stephen Spender. In 1925 he went up to University College London, graduating in 1929, and then went on as an affiliated student to read Part II of the Moral Sciences tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was the only student on a specialised course in logic, taught by Moore, Braithwaite, and Wittgenstein. In 1931, after graduating, Cornforth was awarded a three-year research scholarship at Trinity. In the summer of the same year he joined the Communist Party, setting up the party's first organisation at Cambridge with fellow students such as David Guest; and in the autumn married a fellow Cambridge student, Kitty Klugmann, sister of James. From 1933 Cornforth worked full-time for the Communist Party in East Anglia.  Rejected for military service on medical grounds, during the Second World War Cornforth worked as a farm labourer. He published his first work, Science Versus Idealism, in 1946. In 1950 he was appointed as managing director of Lawrence & Wishart, a post he held until 1975, during which period he was responsible for the publishing of Marx's and Engels's Collected Works.  Cornforth died aged 71 in Islington, London, in 1980, leaving a widow, Kathleen Elliott, his second wife.    Philosophy  When Cornforth began his career in philosophy in the early 1930s, he was a follower of Ludwig Wittgenstein, writing in the then current style of analytic philosophy. Cornforth later became a leading ideologist of the Communist Party of Great Britain. He was critical of the aesthetic theories of fellow Marxist Christopher Caudwell. In Defense of Philosophy attacks empiricist philosophies of many kinds, such as those of Rudolf Carnap (linguistic analysis) and William James (pragmatism), on the materialist grounds that they divorce science and scientific investigation from the search for truer understanding of the really existing universe.  In this book there is a combination of Marxism with deep insights into the interrelations of the various sciences and the philosophical conundrums produced by the empiricist attempt to reduce science to the collection and correlation of data. Both the insights are based on the theory of the primacy of physical work and tools (thus, \"materialism\") in the development of specifically human traits such as language, abstract thought, and social organisation, and the essential role of the external world in the increasingly complex development of forms of life.  Cornforth's multi-volume book Dialectical Materialism was originally published in 1953 by the International Publishers, Co., Inc. The first US edition of this work was printed in 1971. The text originated from lectures that Cornforth received funding for from the London District Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1950.  The first volume, Materialism and the Dialectical Method, provides a good introduction to several important sociological principles: idealism, metaphysics, materialism, mechanical materialism, and dialectical materialism, in addition to Marxist philosophy. Volume 2 of this text is entitled Historical Materialism, and Volume 3 is Theory of Knowledge.

Plot  In the year 2058, an anomalously expanding red giant Sun threatens to engulf the Earth within 100 years. Under a world government, humanity has constructed 12,000 enormous fusion-powered \"Earth Engines\" to thrust Earth out of the Solar System. Before his mission aboard the Navigation Platform International Space Station, Chinese astronaut Liu Peiqiang leaves his son Qi in the care of his father-in-law Han Zi'ang. Half of humanity, mostly chosen by lottery, moves underground; the others die from the cold and cataclysms resulting from the halt of the Earth's rotation as the planet is thrust out of its orbit around the Sun. Seventeen years later, Peiqiang is about to return to Earth after the Chinese New Year. Qi, now an adult, obtains fake IDs and stolen thermal suits from criminal gangs and uses his grandfather's clearance pass to bring his foster sister, Han Duoduo, to tour the surface. Both are arrested at a checkpoint and meet another prisoner, Tim. Zi'ang is also arrested as he attempts to bribe for his grandchildren's release. As Earth approaches its gravity assist around Jupiter, a gravitation spike from Jupiter causes devastating earthquakes that disable many Earth Engines and sets the planet on a collision course with Jupiter. The four escape in the collapse and attempt to make their way to another underground city, but their truck is requisitioned for an emergency mission led by Captain Wang Lei to transport a Lighter Core to restart an Earth Engine in Hangzhou. In the frozen ruins of Shanghai, they lose their vehicle while transporting the component up the ruins of the Shanghai Tower, where Han Zi'ang freezes to death. After confronting the other rescue team members, Liu, Tim and Han Duoduo abandon the mission. The trio come upon a crashed cargo plane with an intact vehicle, where the surviving engineer aboard, Li Yiyi, eventually convinces them to transport another Lighter Core to repair the Earth Engine in Sulawesi, reconciling with the other members on the way. Aboard the space station, Peiqiang discovers that MOSS, the station's computer commander, has decided to abandon Earth and repurpose the station as an interstellar ark to seed a new planet with Earth's biosphere. Breaking out of forced hibernation, he is joined by fellow Russian cosmonaut Maxim Makarov, whom MOSS awakens to stop Liu. While spacewalking, Makarov is killed by the spacecraft's automated security measures. Liu enters the control room, but his attempts to override the evacuation procedures are revoked. Qi's group arrives at the Sulawesi Supply Depot to find that, while most engines around the planet have been restored, the combined thrust is insufficient to divert Earth's trajectory as it approaches Jupiter's Roche limit. MOSS broadcasts a final message to the world, but Peiqiang refuses to follow the computer's instructions. As Jupiter begins to siphon Earth's atmosphere, Qi proposes to ignite the oxygenated mixture of the two planets gases, which will cause a shockwave to knock Earth back into its regular path away from Jupiter. Yiyi configures the Sulawesi engine to fire a plasma beam tall enough to ignite Jupiter, but the group is unable to push the firing pin and ignite the engine. Contacted by Duoduo, Peiqiang is able to persuade the UEG to use its communication channels to call assistance for the party at Sulawesi despite MOSS' doubts. While other rescue parties manage to ignite multiple engines, they are unable to ignite the hydrogen.

It is the fifteenth novel in the Albert Campion series. The Beckoning Flame is a 1915 American silent drama film directed by Charles Swickard and featuring Henry Woodruff, Tsuru Aoki, and Rhea Mitchell in pivotal roles. The Beckoning is an Extreme progressive metal band that originated in Canada. Bloody Birthday is a 1981 American slasher film directed by Ed Hunt, produced by Gerald T. Olson, and starring Susan Strasberg, José Ferrer, and Lori Lethin. It s plot follows a group of children born on the same day who begin committing murders on their tenth birthdays. == Plot ==\nOn June 9, 1970, at a hospital in Southern California, three women give birth at the same time during a solar eclipse. Two boys and a girl are born - Curtis Taylor, Debbie Brody, and Steven Seton.\nTen years later, on June 1, 1980, a young couple are murdered in a cemetery by unseen assailants. The next day, the town sheriff and Debbie's father, James Brody, goes to the local primary school, where Debbie, Curtis and Steven are friends and classmates. Sheriff Brody shows the class a jump rope handle that was found at the scene of yesterday's crime, but fails to obtain any new information about the murders and leaves. Later, after school, Debbie is playing in the backyard with Curtis and Steven. After Debbie shows James that the handle of her jump rope is missing, she gets Steven to beat him to death with a baseball bat, and the kids frame the death as an accidental fall. However, Debbie notices that their classmate Timmy Russell had witnessed the murder.\nAfter the sheriff's funeral, Curtis and Steve lure Timmy to a junkyard and lock him inside an old refrigerator. Timmy manages to escape and tries to tell his older sister Joyce about the incident, but she doesn't believe him.  A few days later, Curtis murders schoolteacher Ms. Davis. The kids also attempt to kill both Timmy and Joyce, but fail. That night, Joyce talks with Timmy about horoscopes, saying that, because the solar eclipse that occurred during the births of the three kids blocked Saturn, the planet controlling the way a person treats other people, it means that something is missing from their personalities. Meanwhile, Curtis murders another young couple making out in a van.\nAt the kids' birthday party on June 9, Curtis tricks Joyce into believing that he poisoned the cake to make her look crazy to everyone. That evening, Debbie's older sister Beverly discovers a scrapbook owned by Debbie, which contains photos and news articles about the murders she and her friends have commited. She confronts Debbie over it, but Debbie lies and says the scrapbook belongs to Curtis. That night, Debbie murders Beverly and gets Curtis and Steven to help her move the body away from the house in order to avert suspicion.\nAfter Beverly's funeral, Curtis, Steven, and Debbie attempt to murder Timmy again before Joyce intervenes. Debbie once again blames Curtis and Steven to make herself look innocent. Joyce threatens to call the police, but Curtis says they'll dismiss her as crazy due to the incident at the birthday party, so an infuriated Joyce lets them go.\nThe next day, Debbie asks Joyce to babysit her, to which she agrees, unaware of her trap. After Joyce and Timmy arrive at Debbie's house, she lets Curtis and Steven in though the back door. Curtis and Steven try to kill Joyce and Timmy, but due to Debbie \"fighting back\", they successfully subdue the two kids and are able to call the police, whom arrest Curtis and Steven the next morning.\nSome time later, Debbie and her mother have fled to a new town and are staying at a motel, with Debbie now going by the name \"Beth\". Beth promises to be a good girl from now on, and the two head off together, not realising that a mechanic has been murdered close by.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Release ==\nBloody Birthday was given a belated limited release theatrically in the United States by Rearguard Productions in 1981.

While climbing in Peru in 1985, he suffered severe injuries and was assumed dead by his climbing companion Simon Yates after falling into a crevasse, but he survived and managed to crawl back to his base camp. He described the ordeal in his 1988 book Touching the Void, which has been adapted into a 2003 documentary film and a 2018 stage play, both of the same name.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSimpson was born on 13 August 1960 to a Scottish father and an Irish mother, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where his father was stationed with the British Army. From the age of 8, Simpson travelled between schools in Britain and various countries where his father was stationed. Simpson began rock climbing after being introduced to the sport at Peak Scar on the Hambleton Hills in north-eastern Yorkshire by a teacher at Ampleforth College. He was 14 when he read The White Spider by Heinrich Harrer, about the first ascent of the North Face of the Eiger by Harrer with Anderl Heckmair, Fritz Kasparek, and Ludwig Vörg in 1938. Despite the inherent dangers of mountaineering described in the book, this reading sparked a passion for the mountains in Simpson.\n\n\n== Climbing career ==\n\nIn 1985, Simpson and his climbing partner Simon Yates made a first ascent of the previously unclimbed west face of Siula Grande (6,344 m) in the Cordillera Huayhuash of the Peruvian Andes. On the descent, Simpson broke his right leg in a fall. Yates attempted to rescue Simpson by roping the pair together, with Yates lowering Simpson as far down the mountain as their rope would allow, before descending himself, and repeating the process. However, as weather conditions deteriorated and visibility diminished, he unknowingly lowered Simpson over a cliff edge. Simpson could not climb up the rope, and it was impossible for Yates to pull him up due to his own precarious position. To avoid being pulled off the mountain himself, Yates was forced to cut the rope. Simpson, however, succeeded in rescuing himself and survived. After they returned to Britain, Yates received some criticism for having cut the rope.\nSimpson published an article about the Siula Grande ordeal in the climbing press shortly afterwards, and later wrote the best-selling book Touching the Void. The book has been translated into 23 languages and has sold almost two million copies worldwide. Simpson wrote further about the Siula Grande expedition in his book This Game of Ghosts as did Yates in his book Against the Wall. A film based on the book was released in 2003. It takes the form of a docudrama with climbing sequences filmed in the European Alps and the Peruvian Andes together with interviews with Simpson, Yates and the third member of the expedition Richard Hawking (a non-climber).\nSimpson underwent six surgical operations as a result of the leg injuries sustained on Siula Grande. Doctors told him he would never climb again and that he would have trouble walking for the rest of his life. In 1987, however, he returned to mountain climbing.\n\n\n== Later activities ==\nHis later non-fiction books describe other expeditions and his changing feeling towards extreme mountaineering brought on by the many deaths that surround the pursuit. A bad fall broke Simpson's left ankle while climbing with Mal Duff in 1991 on Pachermo in Nepal, and is described in his third book This Game of Ghosts. Simpson also made six unsuccessful attempts on the North Face of the Eiger from 2000 to 2003 with his regular climbing partner Ray Delaney, all of which had to be aborted due to bad weather. One of his books, The Beckoning Silence, was made into a documentary shown on Channel 4 in October 2007. The book won the 2003 National Outdoor Book Award (Outdoor Literature category).\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nExcept as noted, all works are non-fiction.\n\nTouching the Void (Jonathan Cape), 1988\nThe Water People (fiction) (Jonathan Cape), 1992\nThis Game of Ghosts (Jonathan Cape), 1993\nStorms of Silence (Jonathan Cape), 1996\nDark Shadows Falling (Jonathan Cape), 1996\nThe Beckoning Silence (Jonathan Cape), 2001\nThe Sound of Gravity (fiction) (Jonathan Cape), 2011\nWalking the Wrong Side of the Grass (fiction) (DirectAuthors.com), 2018\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of climbers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJoe Simpson Official Website\nSpeaker Agent Website\nTouching the Void at IMDb\nPortraits of Joe Simpson at the National Portrait Gallery, London Lori Ann Lethin (born August 4, 1955) is an American retired actress, known for her appearances on television and in several horror films in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLethin was born August 4, 1955 in Los Angeles to Paul Lethin.

He played supporting roles in films and television shows, until he got his break as the lead in the martial arts action film American Ninja (1985). Dudikoff became an action film leading man and followed up with American Ninja 2: The Confrontation (1986), Avenging Force (1986), Platoon Leader (1988), River of Death (1989), Soldier Boyz (1996), Bounty Hunters (1996), Bounty Hunters 2: Hardball (1997), etc. In the 2000s, Dudikoff started to work in real estate, and made film appearances in the 2010s.    Early life  Dudikoff's father, Michael Joseph Stephen Dudikoff Sr., was Eastern Orthodox Christian. Born in New York to Russian immigrants Mary Bogdanova and John Dudikoff, Michael Sr. served in the Army before marrying Dudikoff's mother, Rita T. Girardin, a French-Canadian piano player from Quebec. The couple moved to California and had five children; the fourth, Michael Jr., was diagnosed with dyslexia. Dudikoff graduated from West High School in Torrance, California, and went on to study child psychology at Harbor College.    Career     Mid 1970s to 1985: Modeling and early roles  To pay for his education, Dudikoff worked at a rehabilitation center for abused youth called Cedar House and waited tables at Beachbum Burt's in Redondo Beach, California. He was eventually approached to do some modelling, and did a catwalk at a shopping mall. During lunch one day, Dudikoff served Max Evans, a fashion editor with Esquire magazine, who had come in with some models. Evans asked Dudikoff to walk in a Newport Beach fashion show, and his mother encouraged him to try it out. After a couple of successful runways, Dudikoff retained an agent at the Mary Webb Davis Agency in Los Angeles. Dudikoff soon entered the high fashion world and counted Calvin Klein and GQ among his clients. He moved quickly to international print modeling and traveled between New York, Los Angeles, and Milan by his late 20s.  Dudikoff soon began acting, and he starred in several commercials for companies, including Coppertone, Coca-Cola for Japan, Army Reserve and Stridex. Dudikoff's first television role took place after a meeting with theatrical agent Sid Craig. He went for some readings, and in 1978 he landed a supporting role in one episode of the hit TV show Dallas, and shortly after the part as Joanie's first boyfriend in the American sitcom Happy Days.

Shortly after, Cannon went on a worldwide search to find who would play Private Joe Armstrong, the American ninja. Over 400 candidates went on to audition for the part. The producer and owner of Cannon, Menahem Golan, and director Sam Firstenberg thought Dudikoff was the obvious choice for the part. Golan even went on to say that he would be the next James Dean. It was a surprise for Dudikoff, who at the time was mostly known for supporting roles in comedies. It was Dudikoff's first collaboration with actor Steve James, who was hired to play the partner of the American ninja, a role he maintained for the first three installments. On a $1 million budget, it went on to gross over $10 million domestically in the US and did extremely well in foreign markets.

He died in 1936 during an attempt to climb the then-unclimbed north face of the Eiger with his partner Andreas Hinterstoisser.    Biography  Toni Kurz was born on 13 January 1913 in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Germany, where he was raised. He completed a brief apprenticeship as a pipefitter before joining the German Wehrmacht in 1934 as a professional soldier. Together with his childhood friend Andreas Hinterstoisser, he made numerous first ascents of peaks in the Berchtesgaden Alps, including some of the most difficult climbs of that time. The two young men climbed the southwest wall of the Berchtesgadener Hochthron in 1934, and the south wall of the straight pillar in 1936. They also made first ascents in the Reiter Alpe on the German–Austrian border, and of the direct southern route up the Watzmannkinder, part of the Watzmann, in 1935. In July 1936, Kurz and Hinterstoisser left Berchtesgaden, where they were serving in the military, and travelled by bicycle to Kleine Scheidegg, Switzerland to attempt the then unclimbed north face of the Eiger. While on the mountain, they met up with two Austrian climbers—Edi Rainer and Willy Angerer—and the four decided to continue their attempt together. During the ascent, Angerer was injured by falling rocks loosened by the warmth of the rising sun as they crossed the first ice field. As a result of Angerer's worsening condition and their slow progress across the second ice field, they abandoned the attempt on the Eiger and decided to descend. A further challenge arose when Kurz and his fellow climbers failed to retrace their route across the area now known as the Hinterstoisser Traverse and had to climb downwards. As the result of another avalanche, Hinterstoisser's anchor became dislodged causing him to fall to his death. Angerer, who was climbing below Kurz, was struck by a falling boulder, dying instantly and causing his body to fall and catch at the end of the running line where it remained suspended. Edi Rainer, the climber who had been securing the other two, was violently pulled against the wall by the weight of Angerer's body. Rainer was struck in the face by the dislodged anchor shattering his jaw and entangling Rainer where he died minutes later of asphyxiation. Kurz now the only surviving climber, remained suspended by a single rope with the cliff wall out of reach. Later that day, amid worsening weather, a rescue team attempted to reach Kurz from below, ascending by means of the railway tunnel that ran through the mountain, the Jungfraubahn. They could not reach Kurz due to the severity of the storm and were forced to leave Kurz dangling unprotected and exposed to the blizzard for the entire night. The next day, the team again attempted to effect a rescue; Kurz himself made the effort, despite a frozen hand due to losing a glove, to abseil down the face of the mountain and reach the team. To accomplish this, he first had to cut loose the dead body of Angerer hanging below him, then climb up and cut loose Rainer's body. To increase the length of his rope, he unraveled it and tied the three strands end-to-end, this entire process took five hours. He then lowered the rope to the waiting rescuers, who attached their own rope, strong enough for the abseil.  The mountain guides only had one long rope – 60 metres – with them. Hans Schlunegger just put it between his back and his rucksack (not into his rucksack) to save some time. This was not an unusual practice for them. Unfortunately when he made a sudden movement the rope dropped and fell down to the foot of the wall. To try to reach the required length, the team combined two shorter ropes, but the combined length still fell short. Kurz pulled up their rope, fixed it, and began his abseiling descent. He was stopped a mere couple of meters above his rescuers by the knot. To abseil any further he would have had to raise himself enough to release the tension on the knot and let it pass through his gear. Desperately, Kurz tried to move himself past the knot, but in vain. Facing the futility of his situation, he said only \"Ich kann nicht mehr\" (\"I can't go [on] anymore\") and died of hypothermia shortly after.

Susan Elizabeth Strasberg (May 22, 1938 – January 21, 1999) was an American stage, film, and television actress. Thought to be the next Hepburn-type ingenue, she was nominated for a Tony Award at age 18, playing the title role in The Diary of Anne Frank. She appeared on the covers of LIFE and Newsweek in 1955. A close friend of Marilyn Monroe and Richard Burton, she wrote two best-selling tell-all books. Her later career primarily consisted of slasher and horror films, followed by TV roles, by the 1980s.    Biography     Early life   Strasberg was born in New York City to theatre director and drama coach Lee Strasberg of the Actors Studio and former actress Paula Strasberg. Her brother, John, is an acting coach. Her father was born in what is now Ukraine, and her mother in New York City. They were both from Jewish families who emigrated from Europe. Strasberg attended the Professional Children's School, and then spent time at both The High School of Music & Art and the High School of Performing Arts. She also did some modelling.    Early roles  At age 14, Strasberg appeared off-Broadway in Maya in 1953, which ran seven performances. Her TV debut was in \"Catch a Falling Star\", an episode of Goodyear Playhouse directed by Delbert Mann the same year. She was in Romeo and Juliet for Kraft Theatre (1954), playing Juliet, and episodes of General Electric Theater and Omnibus. She had a regular role in a short-lived sitcom, The Marriage, playing the daughter of Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy. It was the first network show broadcast in color. Strasberg made her film debut in The Cobweb (1955). She followed it with a widely praised performance as a teenager in Picnic (1955), playing the younger sister of Kim Novak. Kim Stanley played the role on Broadway but was too old for film. Joshua Logan, the director, wrote Strasberg's \"incipient beauty and spirit seemed just right for me.\"    The Diary of Anne Frank  Strasberg originated the title role in the Broadway production of The Diary of Anne Frank, directed by Garson Kanin, which ran for 717 performances from 1955 to 1957. Brooks Atkinson wrote that she was \"a slender, enchanting young lady with a heart-shaped face, a pair of burning eyes, and the soul of an actress.\" Strasberg was nominated for a Tony Award at the age of 18 and became the youngest actress to star on Broadway with her name above the marquee title. In 1955 she appeared twice on the cover of Life (July 11, 1955 issue; November 11, 1955 issue) and soon after on the cover of Newsweek (December 19, 1955 issue). During her run on the show she did The Cradle Song with Helen Hayes on TV. The success of the play led to numerous film offers. She decided on the lead in Stage Struck (1958), directed by Sidney Lumet. It was a remake of Morning Glory (1933) with Katharine Hepburn. According to one obituary, \"It had seemed as if the beautiful, dark-haired actress might have an impact equal to that made by Jean Simmons and Audrey Hepburn as ingenues.\" Strasberg was not cast in the George Stevens film version of Anne Frank. Several reasons have been suggested for this: that Stevens did not want to deal with the influence of Strasberg's mother, Paula, and that Stevens saw Strasberg at the end of the play's run when her performance had become tired. Strasberg did not test for the role. Strasberg's next appearance on Broadway was in Time Remembered (1957–58) by Jean Anouilh with Richard Burton and Helen Hayes. It was another success and ran for 248 performances. Strasberg continued to guest star on TV shows like Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse, Play of the Week (a production of The Cherry Orchard with Hayes), and Our American Heritage. She was in the cast of the New York City Center production of William Saroyan's The Time of Your Life that played at the Brussels World Fair in 1958. It was filmed for Armchair Theatre.

Movie, Movies, The Movie, or The Movies may also refer to: The Beckoning Silence is a 2007 British television film that follows and retraces the unsuccessful attempt to scale the north face of the Eiger led by Toni Kurz in 1936.

In 2008 it won an International Emmy Award. == Cast ==\nAndreas Abegglen as Willy Angerer\nSimon Anthamatten as Andreas Hinterstoisser\nCyrille Berthod as Edi Rainer\nRoger Schäli as Toni Kurz\nJoe Simpson as himself\nSteven Mackintosh as the narrator In July 1936, five climbers died while attempting to ascend the north face of the Eiger mountain in Switzerland.    Background  After a deadly and unsuccessful German attempt in 1935, ten climbers from Austria and Germany travelled to the still-unclimbed north face of the Eiger in 1936, but, before serious summit attempts could get underway, one climber was killed during a training climb. The weather was so bad that after waiting for a change and seeing none on the way, several climbers gave up. Only four remained: two Bavarians, Andreas Hinterstoisser and Toni Kurz, and two Austrians, Willy Angerer and Edi Rainer.    Ascent and retreat   The weather improved and they made preliminary explorations of the lowest part of the face. Hinterstoisser accidentally fell 37 metres (121 ft) but was not injured. A few days later, the four men began ascending the north face. They climbed quickly, but on the second day the weather changed; clouds came down and allowed observers on the ground only intermittent visibility of the climbers on the face. On the second day, the party was bombarded by rockfall, a notorious problem on the north face route. Angerer was hit just below the shoulder blade and injured. It is said that he tried to continue climbing, but the expedition had to be stopped for the night. The climbing resumed on the following day, when, during a break in the clouds, the party was observed descending. Later, it would be learned that the group had no choice but to retreat, since Angerer had suffered more serious injuries than initially assessed. The party became stuck on the face when they could not recross a difficult traverse – which became known as the Hinterstoisser traverse – from which they had pulled the rope during their ascent. Exhausted on their third day of climbing, with two days of bad weather, Hinterstoisser still tried for hours to cross the traverse, which was now covered in verglas. On the way up, Hinterstoisser had used a technique called a \"tension traverse\", where a rope is fixed and kept taut, allowing the lead climber to \"lean\" on it for balance. However, this technique cannot be used when descending. The weather worsened, and falling rocks, snow, and water could be seen from the town. The group decided to abseil from the lower lip of the First Ice Field down the vertical face (the great rock barrier). A ledge ran along the wall of rock, which, if they could get to it, would lead them to the Stollenloch, an entrance to the train tunnel. As belay devices had not yet been invented, they rappelled using the Dülfersitz method. Contact was made with a railway guard at the Eigerwand railway station halfway down the descent. During their exchange, the climber claimed everything had been going all right (perhaps out of pride and knowledge that they were very close to safety). However, as Hinterstoisser set up the last abseil of the descent, an avalanche came down the mountain, taking Hinterstoisser, who had unclipped from the group, with it. He was found at the bottom of the mountain days later. Angerer also fell and was killed when his body hit the rock face, while Rainer quickly asphyxiated from the weight of the rope around his diaphragm. Only Kurz survived the avalanche, hanging on the rope with his dead comrades.    Rescue attempt  Late on the third day, three Swiss guides started a rescue attempt from the Eigerwand Station. They failed to reach Kurz but came within shouting distance and learned what had happened. Kurz explained the fate of his companions: one had fallen down the face, another was frozen above him, and the third had fractured his skull in falling and was hanging on the rope below him. In the morning, the three guides returned, traversing the face again from a hole near the Eigerwand Station despite avalanche-prone conditions. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless. After four nights exposed to the elements, one of his hands and his arm was completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself back to the mountain face after cutting loose Angerer below him. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz, but they managed to get a rope long enough to reach Kurz by tying two ropes together. While abseiling, however, Kurz could not get the knot that joined the two ropes to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers, who were just a few metres below him, desperately trying to move himself past the knot, but in vain. He then began to lose consciousness. Andreas Hinterstoisser (3 October 1914 – 21 July 1936) was a German mountain climber active in the 1930s. He was killed in the 1936 Eiger north face climbing disaster during an attempted summit via that route with his partner Toni Kurz. A section of the north face was later named the \"Hinterstoisser Traverse\" in his honor. The 2008 film North Face was based on his experience climbing the Eiger.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAndreas Hinterstoisser was born on 3 October 1914 in Bad Reichenhall, Bavaria, Germany, where he was raised. He worked in a bank before joining the German Wehrmacht as a professional soldier in 1935. Together with his childhood friend Toni Kurz, he made numerous first ascents of peaks in the Berchtesgaden Alps, including some of the most difficult climbs of that time.\nThe two young men climbed the southwest wall of the Berchtesgadener Hochthron in 1934, and the south wall of the straight pillar in 1936. They also made first ascents in the Reiter Alpe on the German–Austrian border, and of the direct southern route up the Watzmannkinder in the Watzmann in 1935.\n\n\n== Eiger North face ==\n\nIn 1936, he was on the four-man team making the second attempt to scale the north face of the Eiger. He was renowned as one of the best rock climbers of his time and is held in high esteem to this day.\nHe cleverly managed to traverse a vertical slab of very icy rock—a feat that made the rest of the attempt on the Eiger possible—by climbing up on the slab and then lowering himself to execute a pendulum, or 'tension traverse', to the other side, where he secured a horizontal fixed rope to enable his companions to cross the unclimbable slab. This part of the route became known as the Hinterstoisser Traverse in his honour.\n\nDuring a retreat from the wall, due both to an injury suffered by one of his comrades and to the severe weather, Hinterstoisser could not recross the traverse to safety because the group had previously removed the rope that had helped them across. The group decided to abseil down the vertical face (the great rock barrier) to the base of the mountain. Contact was made with a railway guard halfway down the descent during which the climbers claimed everything was all right (perhaps out of pride or the knowledge that they were close to safety).\nHowever, as Hinterstoisser set up the last stage of the descent an avalanche came down the mountain, wiping out Hinterstoisser, who had unclipped from the group. He fell to his death and was found at the bottom of the mountain days later. The rest of the group suffered the same fate: Willy Angerer was killed by the impact; Edi Rainer was asphyxiated from the weight of the rope holding his comrades; and Toni Kurz died from exposure, despite having made contact with rescuers.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe tragic story became well known after publication of Heinrich Harrer's classic 1960 book The White Spider and was more recently covered by Joe Simpson's book (and Emmy-winning TV documentary), The Beckoning Silence, as well as the 2008 German dramatic movie North Face.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nRote Fluh and Hinterstoisser Traverse Eiger north face photos - Wayback Machine archive\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Who is Rhescuporis I (Odrysian)'s paternal grandfather?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe Odrysian kingdom (; Ancient Greek: Βασίλειον Ὀδρυσῶν) was an ancient Thracian state that thrived between the early 5th century BC and the early 3rd / late 1st century BC. Located in present-day Bulgaria, southeastern Romania (Northern Dobruja), northern Greece and European Turkey, it was a tribal amalgam dominated by the Odrysians that was the first large political entity to develop in the eastern Balkans. The Odrysian kingdom was founded by king Teres I, exploiting the collapse of the Persian presence in Europe due to the failed invasion of Greece in 480–79. Teres and his son Sitalces pursued a policy of expansion, making the kingdom one of the most powerful of its time. Throughout much of its early history it remained an ally of Athens and even joined the Peloponnesian War on its side. By 400 BC the state showed first signs of fatigue, although the skilled Cotys I initiated a brief renaissance that lasted until his murder in 360 BC. Afterwards the kingdom disintegrated: southern and central Thrace were divided among three Odrysian kings, while the northeast came under the dominion of the kingdom of the Getae. The three Odrysian kingdoms were eventually conquered by the rising kingdom of Macedon under Philip II in 340 BC. A much smaller Odrysian state was revived in around 330 BC by Seuthes III, who founded a new capital named Seuthopolis that functioned until the second quarter of the 3rd century BC. After that there is little conclusive evidence for the persistence of an Odrysian state, with the exception of a dubious Odrysian king fighting in the Third Macedonian War named Cotys. The Odrysian heartland was eventually annexed by the Sapaean kingdom in the late 1st century BC, which was converted into a Roman province of Thracia in 45-46 AD.    History     Background     Thrace and its early history  Since the ancient Thracians lacked an indigenous writing tradition, the most important sources for the reconstruction of their history are archaeological remains, coins as well as accounts of ancient Greek historians. Said historians considered the Thracians to be a numerous people and their country, Thrace, to be of barely comprehensible size, so large that Andron of Halicarnassus (4th century BC) thought of it as a continent of its own. While the boundaries of Thrace fluctuated throughout history, Thrace can be divided in a northern and a southern half, which were also culturally different. The border between the two halves has been identified as the Haemus Mountains or the Danube slightly further north. Southern Thrace covered the fertile valley between the Haemus and the Rhodopes, the Strandzha and the shores of the Propontis and the Aegean and Black Seas. The western boundary was marked by the Strymon and the upper Morava. Northern Thrace was defined by the Danube, the Carpathians and the adjacent western tip of the Pontic–Caspian steppe, thus enclosing parts of the territory now comprising modern Romania, Moldova, Serbia and Ukraine. Thrace also extended into what is now northwestern Turkey both west and east (Bithynia, Mysia) of the Propontis.  Thracians had already settled in the 2nd millennium BCE, and were featured in the epics of Homer. Occasional references to them appear in the following centuries, although it was not until the 5th century when Greek literature developed an interest in discussing non-Greeks more extensively. In the 7th and 6th centuries, much of the Thracian coast was settled by Greek colonists who founded numerous towns, like Thasos, Byzantion or Odessos. The political history of the Thracian tribes of this age is virtually unknown, although it is recorded that in the late 6th century, Athenian settlers interacted with a \"king of Thrace\" (and possible predecessor of the Odrysian kings?) residing north of the Chersonese peninsula. The absence of imported artefacts confirms that inland Thrace north of the Rhodopes remained largely isolated from the Aegean trade until the late 6th century.    Persian Thrace   In around 513 BC, an army of the mighty Persian dynasty of the Achaemenids crossed the Bosphorus, after already having subdued the Thracians of Bithynia thirty years earlier. King Darius I's goal was a punitive expedition against the Scythians at the northern shores of the Black Sea. Most eastern Thracian tribes submitted peacefully, except of the Getae, who were defeated. Rhescuporis I may refer to:\n\nRhescuporis I (Odrysian), Odrysian King of Thrace, 240–215 BC\nRhescuporis I (Sapaean), Sapean King of Thrace, 48-41 BC Frederick\" Fred\" Le Deux( born 4 December 1934) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Geelong in the Victorian Football League( VFL). He is the grandfather of Tom Hawkins. Zhao Shoushan( 12 November 1894 – 20 June 1965) was a KMT general and later Chinese Communist Party politician. He is the grandfather of Zhao Leji. Lyon Cohen( 1868–1937) was a Polish- born Canadian businessman and a philanthropist. He was the grandfather of singer/ poet Leonard Cohen. Rhescuporis I (Ancient Greek: Ραισκούπορις) was a king of the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace in 240 BC - 215 BC, succeeding his father, Cotys III. Rhescuporis I (Ancient Greek: Ραισκούπορις, Raiskouporis) was a possible king of the Odrysians in Thrace in the 3rd century BC. Scholarship has long associated a coin type struck for a king Cotys on one side and a king Rhescuporis on the other and also a king Cotys, father of a Rhescuporis, named in a decree from Apollonia (Sozopol) with the Odrysian rulers Cotys III and Rhescuporis I. However, these associations have been doubted, and some scholars have redated both the coin type and the inscription to almost three centuries later, when the same names and relationships appear again among the Astaean and Sapaean kings of Thrace. It is therefore uncertain whether Cotys III was succeeded by a son named Rhescuporis. If he was, the coin type struck for both kings would be the only certain proof that Rhescuporis reigned, because the Apollonia decree only mentions that he had spent time in the town as hostage on his father's behalf. Rev. John Westley( 1636 – 78) was an English nonconformist minister. He was the grandfather of John Wesley( founder of Methodism). Kaya Alp was, according to Ottoman tradition, the son of Kızıl Buğa and the father of Suleyman Shah, who was, in turn, the grandfather of Ertuğrul, and the great grandfather of the Ottoman Empire founder, Osman I. Abd al- Muttalib Shaybah ibn Hashim( c. 497 – 578) was the grandfather of Islamic prophet Muhammad. Cotys III or Kotys III can refer to two kings of Thrace:\n\nCotys III (Odrysian), ruled ca. 270 BC\nCotys III (Sapaean), ruled 12–19 AD The Odrysian kingdom (; Ancient Greek: Βασίλειον Ὀδρυσῶν) was an ancient Thracian state that thrived between the early 5th century BC and the early 3rd / late 1st century BC. Located in present-day Bulgaria, southeastern Romania (Northern Dobruja), northern Greece and European Turkey, it was a tribal amalgam dominated by the Odrysians that was the first large political entity to develop in the eastern Balkans. The Odrysian kingdom was founded by king Teres I, exploiting the collapse of the Persian presence in Europe due to the failed invasion of Greece in 480–79. Teres and his son Sitalces pursued a policy of expansion, making the kingdom one of the most powerful of its time. Throughout much of its early history it remained an ally of Athens and even joined the Peloponnesian War on its side. By 400 BC the state showed first signs of fatigue, although the skilled Cotys I initiated a brief renaissance that lasted until his murder in 360 BC. Afterwards the kingdom disintegrated: southern and central Thrace were divided among three Odrysian kings, while the northeast came under the dominion of the kingdom of the Getae. The three Odrysian kingdoms were eventually conquered by the rising kingdom of Macedon under Philip II in 340 BC. A much smaller Odrysian state was revived in around 330 BC by Seuthes III, who founded a new capital named Seuthopolis that functioned until the second quarter of the 3rd century BC. After that there is little conclusive evidence for the persistence of an Odrysian state, with the exception of a dubious Odrysian king fighting in the Third Macedonian War named Cotys. The Odrysian heartland was eventually annexed by the Sapaean kingdom in the late 1st century BC, which was converted into a Roman province of Thracia in 45-46 AD.

His one secure attestation is in an inscription from Athens dated to 330 BC; the inscription honored Reboulas, brother of Cotys and son of Seuthes. This is generally interpreted to mean that Cotys, not yet king, was the son of Seuthes III by a marriage earlier than that to Berenike (since their four sons did not include a Cotys or a Reboulas). Building on this interpretation of the evidence, a certain Gonimase (Gonimasē), wife of a Seuthes, buried in a tomb near Smjadovo, has been proposed as Seuthes III's earlier wife and mother of Cotys and Reboulas. However, the Athenian inscription precedes the first clear attestation of Seuthes III by about seven years, and various scholars have proposed Seuthes I, Seuthes II, and even a non-reigning Seuthes as the father of Cotys and Reboulas. One scholar conjectures that Cotys was an elder son of Seuthes III but did not live to succeed his father, dying during the siege of Callatis (Mangalia) in 310 BC. While it is likely that Cotys II was a Thracian ruler in this period, it is not possible to establish his precise relationship (chronologically and genealogically) to Seuthes III. The overall chronology and the names suggest the possibility that Cotys II may have been the father of Raizdos and grandfather of the latter's son Cotys III.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Thracian tribes\n\n\n== References ==\n\nK.

Early life  Cotys was known to have been born  during the reign of Seuthes I, based on ancient sources and date of birth estimates for Cotys, his daughter who married the Athenian general Iphicrates, and her son Menestheus. According to Harpokration, he reigned for 24 years, which places his accession in 384 BC. Although his origins are actually unknown, an Athenian inscription dated to 330 BC honors Reboulas, brother of Cotys and son of king Seuthes. As the ordinal of Seuthes is not mentioned, it was unclear which of the preceding kings named Seuthes is meant by the inscription. While scholars originally believed Seuthes II to be the father of Cotys I, now it is known that Seuthes I was his father, as Seuthes II was only 7 years old at the time of Seuthes I's abdication in 411 BC.  In 390 BC, the Athenian general Iphicrates joined his colleague Thrasybulus in Thrace, helping arrange peace between the Thracian rulers Amadocus I and Seuthes II, and making both Athenian allies. Iphicrates remained for about two years, and married the daughter of Cotys in opulent circumstances. Cotys' precise standing at the time remains obscure, but he is tentatively identified as a brother of Hebryzelmis, who was the Odrysian king in Thrace in 386/385 BC, when he was honored in an Athenian decree.    Early reign  Shortly afterwards, in 384 BC, Cotys I became king, perhaps at first in the interior parts of Thrace. With the help of Iphicrates, Cotys succeeded in establishing himself as the heir of Hebryzelmis, and eliminating the opposition of his rivals, possibly including Amadocus II and Saratocus. Archaeological finds of items inscribed for Cotys to the north and west suggest expansion and contacts in that direction that have escaped the narrative sources. The name of Cotys (in one instance described as a son of the god Apollon) appears several times on objects from the Rogozen Treasure, although the precise manner in which it came to be buried in northwestern Bulgaria, presumably in the territory of the Triballi, remains unclear.    Conflict with Athens  As Cotys tried to enlarge his kingdom, including towards the Aegean and the Chersonese, his actions led to increasing tensions with Athens. In the early 370s BC, the Second Athenian Confederacy was founded with a number of neighboring cities and islands joining the Confederacy as a safeguard against the threat from Cotys, among others. In 375 BC Cotys probably supported Hales, leader of Triballi, a powerful Thracian tribe in northwestern Thrace, in their attack on the city of Abdera. According to Diodorus, the city was saved only after the intervention of the Athenian general, Chabrias, whose forces then garrisoned the city. In 367 BC Ariobarzanes, the Persian satrap of Phrygia, occupied Sestos. Following Ariobarzanes' revolt against the Persian king Artaxerxes II in 365 BC, Cotys apparently opposed Ariobarzanes and his ally, Athens, but his actions are ambivalent and unclear. The same year Cotys welcomed the return of his son-in-law, the dismissed Athenian general Iphicrates, and a new ally, the mercenary commander Charidemus, who married another daughter of Cotys. The Athenians under their general Timotheus were able to gain Sestos and Krithote. Soon after, in 363 or 362 BC, Cotys sent Miltokythes into the Thracian Chersonese to take Sestos. Miltokythes besieged the city and starved it into surrender, then attacked Krithote. Athenian generals sent to relieve the attacked towns were unsuccessful. At this time, in 362 BC, however, Miltokythes rebelled against Cotys, seizing the royal treasury at Hieron Oros and, finding himself besieged there by Cotys, appealed for help to both Ariobarzanes and Athens. Cotys also appealed for help from Athens, and allied himself to the Persian satrap of Lydia Autophradates, enemy of Ariobarzanes. Athens chose to support Miltokythes, and sent a fleet to his aid, but this was defeated by Cotys with the help of his son-in-law Iphicrates.

Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan ; 6 May 1918 – 2 November 2004) was the ruler of Abu Dhabi for more than 30 years (6 August 1966 – 2 November 2004). He was the founding father and the principal driving force behind the formation of the United Arab Emirates, becoming the Union's first \"Raʾīs\" (President), a post which he held for a period of almost 33 years (1971 until his death in 2004). He is popularly referred to in the UAE as the Father of the Nation. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (Arabic: زايد بن سلطان آل نهيان, romanized: Zāyid bin Sulṭān Āl Nahyān; 6 May 1918 – 2 November 2004) was an Emirati royal, politician, philanthropist and the founder of the United Arab Emirates. Zayed served as the governor of Eastern Region from 1946 until he succeeded Sheikh Shakhbut as the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966, and then as the first president of the United Arab Emirates while he retained his position as Abu Dhabi's ruler from 1971 until his death in 2004.  He is revered in the United Arab Emirates as the Waalid al-Ummah (\"Father of the Nation\"), credited for being the principal driving force behind uniting the seven Trucial States to found the Union of the United Arab Emirates. Zayed replaced his older brother Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan as the ruler of Abu Dhabi on 6 August 1966 after Shakhbut was deposed through a bloodless coup by members of the ruling family with British support.    Family and early life  Zayed was the youngest of four sons of Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan. His father was the ruler of Abu Dhabi from 1922 until his death in 1926. Zayed was the youngest of his four brothers. His eldest brother, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan, became ruler of Abu Dhabi after their uncle, Saqr bin Zayed Al Nahyan. His mother was Sheikha Salama bint Butti. She extracted a promise from her sons not to use violence against each other, a promise which they kept. Sheikh Zayed was named after his grandfather, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan (\"Zayed the Great\"), who ruled the emirate from 1855 to 1909. At the time of Sheikh Zayed's birth, the sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi was one of seven Trucial States along the lower coast of the Persian Gulf. He also showed interest in falconry. Zayed was born at Qasr al-Hosn, Abu Dhabi, in 1918 and moved from Abu Dhabi to Al Ain in 1926, after the death of his father. As Zayed was growing up in Al-Ain, there were no modern schools anywhere along the coast. He only received a basic instruction in the principles of Islam, and lived in the desert with Bedouin tribesmen, familiarising himself with the life of the people, their traditional skills and their ability to survive under the harsh climatic conditions.    Career and reign   Zayed was appointed the governor of the Eastern Region of Abu Dhabi in 1946, and was based in the Muwaiji fort in Al Ain. At this time, the area was poor and prone to outbreaks of disease. When parties from Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) began exploring for oil in the area, Zayed assisted them. In 1952, a small Saudi Arabian force led by Turki bin Abdullah Al-Otaishan occupied the village of Hamasa in the Buraimi Oasis (the 'Buraimi Dispute'). Zayed was prominent in his opposition to Saudi territorial claims and reportedly rejected a bribe of about £30 million to allow Aramco to explore for oil in the disputed territory. As part of this dispute, Zayed and his brother Hazza attended the Buraimi arbitration tribunal in Geneva in September 1955 and gave evidence to tribunal members. When the tribunal was abandoned amid allegations of Saudi bribery, the British initiated the reoccupation of the Buraimi Oasis through a local military force, the Trucial Oman Levies. A period of stability followed during which Zayed helped to develop the region and took a particular interest in the restoration of the falaj system, a network of water channels which kept the plantations of the Buraimi Oasis irrigated and fertile. The discovery of oil in 1958, and the start of oil exports in 1962, led to frustration among members of the ruling family about the lack of progress under Sheikh Shakhbut's rule. Shakhbut was seen as averse to spending revenue from oil money to develop the emirate by other members of Al Nahyan and hence they requested British help to install Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan as the ruler of Abu Dhabi in his stead through a bloodless coup. On 6 August 1966, Shakhbut was deposed in a bloodless palace coup. The move to replace Shakhbut with Zayed had the unanimous backing of the Al Nahyan family. The news was conveyed to Shakhbut by British Acting Resident Glen Balfour-Paul who added the support of the British to the consensus of the family.

On 29 March 2023, MBZ appointed his son Sheikh Khalid as crown prince of Abu Dhabi and his future successor. Academics have characterized the UAE under MBZ as an authoritarian capitalist country. Since Mohamed became the de facto president, he introduced policies which aimed at economic liberalization. This included the introduction of VAT in 2018, corporate taxes and bankruptcy laws; the elimination of gas subsidies, as well as the removal of curbs of foreign ownership of businesses and the decriminalization of bounced cheques.

MBZ fell out with the Obama administration on the Iran nuclear deal and supported the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. The UAE was a leading party in the Qatar diplomatic crisis, in which the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other Arab countries like Egypt and Jordan severed diplomatic relations with Qatar based on claims that Qatar supports the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoot organizations. MBZ maintained a close relationship with former US President Donald Trump, with reports suggesting that MBZ was pushing Trump to take a more tough stance on Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. In September 2020, the UAE, alongside Bahrain, and later Morocco and Sudan, signed the Abraham Accords, an agreement to normalize diplomatic relationship with the State of Israel, a deal which was brokered by Trump. The UAE has more recently been involved in an economic rivalry with Saudi Arabia, and opposed Saudi efforts for OPEC+ production cuts.

He was also conferred the title of \"Thirai Isai Thilagam\" (Pride of Cine Music Directors) in Tamil cinema. His assistant Pukazhenthi is credited to have usually writing the score and arranging the orchestra, after Mahadevan composes a tune.    Early life and career  K. V. Mahadevan was born in 1918 at Krishnancoil, a locality in Nagercoil, Kanyakumari District. Father Venkadachalam Bhagavathar and Mother Pichaiyammal K. V. Mahadevan, also called by his honorific name Thirai Isai Thilagam (lit. pride of film music), did music composing for more than 50 years, beginning from 1942 until 1993. Telugu Film Industry crowned him with title \"Swara Brahma\" (Creator/Father of Musical notes). His song \"mama mama mama\" from 1962 Telugu movie Manchi Manasulu became popular those days, as a result, Telugu film industry with love started calling him \"Mama\" since then. His favorite music instrument is Nadaswaram similar to (Shehnai).It could be the reason his compositions have always reflected its mellifluous pattern. Another great characteristic from this scholar as it is known to everyone and open fact that he never asked lyricist to write lyrics for his earlier composed tunes. Always composed tunes to written lyrics.Very few in India have been able to exercise this feat with success. Music has no Language barriers. \"Sisurvethi, pasurvethi, vethiganarasamphanihi\" is a popular Sanskrit axiom which says that Music has the power to impress a child, animal, and the universe alike. As we can read from Climax song of film Sankarabharanam (1980 film), \"Tatva Saadhana ku Satya Shodhana ku Sangeethame Sopanam\" (Music is a Stair Case for attaining Enlightenment and truth discovery) \"Swara Brahma\" left no foot prints of his mother tongue when it comes to his scores in other languages. Telugu language being inherited from Sanskrit, has its own nativity which composers of Telugu as their mother tongue and \"North\" (O. P. Nayyar), \"West\" (C. Ramchandra), (Shankar–Jaikishan), (Laxmikant–Pyarelal), (Chirrantan Bhatt), \"East\" (R. D. Burman), (Salil Chowdhury), (Ravindra Jain), (Bappi Lahiri) like composers could fulfill effortlessly. \"Swara Brahma\" automatically had fallen into that groove as he was getting to know meaning of lyrics for every song before composing them. Assistant Puhalendi too exhibited similar characteristics as it was evident from interludes orchestration. According to famous Director K. Raghavendra Rao opinion as expressed by him, Mama \"Mahadevan\" is \"Saraswati Putra\" and K. Chakravarthy is \"Ekalavya\". His 1977 film Adavi Ramudu (1977 film) was recorded as the highest grossing Telugu film of the 1970s. Director K. Raghavendra Rao 's father K. S.

His absence of consent to prayers & worship at home is repentant to his benevolent wife, Kathyayini. Plus, she is troubled for her two sons, Ramesh & Suresh, who are turpitudes by their father's indulgence. Jagannatha Rao, a government official who authorizes the hefty contracts, and Dhannajay Rao make his dereliction of duty. Though he always wants to be candid, he is retreated by his greedy wife, who aspires to knit their daughter Padmini/Pammy with Ramesh as they are infatuated.\nMeanwhile, Ramesh moved abroad to pursue higher studies and returned after a few years. Suddenly, all are startled to view him as a true Indian when Kathyayini is in jubilation. Then, he states that patriotism flourished in him after witnessing how foreigners worship their culture, customs, & traditions and being conscious of the eminence of his country. Dhannajay Rao rebukes, forasmuch as what he learned is hardly stupidity and gullibility, and asks him to comprehend the status quo. Parallelly, as an anecdote, Pammy breaks up with Ramesh by enforcing her mother for his ongoing behavior.\nAs of today, Ramesh proceeds to their village as a commoner, looking for inequities, irregularities, & evils in society. Whereat, he acquaints a local lass, Satyavati, who has a career in saree weaving and endears her. Ramesh spots damn many in that profession going along thrall of mediator Abbaiah Naidu and attempts to hinder him. As a result, he has been thrashed and kicked out. Since the return, Ramesh mentions to his father that what he said is correct, and concurrently, he decides to watch over their cement factory at the very spot. \nNow that Ramesh is back in the village, Suresh also aids his brother in his style. They make meteoric changes by forming an association to relieve the saree-weaving pros from the evil clutches of Abbaiah Naidu, bringing soul-searching to the youth manipulated by dirty politicians. They all act together to transform the terrain by constructing Roads, wells, toilets, etc. Presently, Dhannajay Rao ploys to acquire a dam project mutually. Ramesh designed it for the welfare of desperate prime by forming a land army for which Jagannatha Rao also strongholds. Moreover, Kathyayini files a complaint against her husband's barbarities to triumph over Ramesh's aim when the Govt appoints a team. Here, Dhannajay Rao ruses to slaughter them and seeks to force Kathyayini to withdraw the complaint. At last, Suresh tragically dies with the team that reforms Dhanjaya Rao. Finally, the movie ends with a proclamation that Never mind if you are not patriotic, but do not implant and screw up your children's mindset. Do not scapegoat them in political chess.

Olav Aaraas( born 10 July 1950) is a Norwegian historian and museum director. He was born in Fredrikstad. From 1982 to 1993 he was the director of Sogn Folk Museum, from 1993 to 2010 he was the director of Maihaugen and from 2001 he has been the director of the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History. In 2010 he was decorated with the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. Fascism ( FASH-iz-əm) is a far-right, authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement, characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy, subordination of individual interests for the perceived good of the nation or race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy. Opposed to anarchism, democracy, pluralism, egalitarianism, liberalism, socialism, and Marxism, fascism is placed on the far-right wing within the traditional left–right spectrum. Fascism rose to prominence in early 20th-century Europe. The first fascist movements emerged in Italy during World War I before spreading to other European countries, most notably Germany. Fascism also had adherents outside of Europe. Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the mass mobilization of society erased the distinction between civilians and combatants. A military citizenship arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner. The war resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is inherently negative or pointless, instead viewing imperialism, political violence, and war as means to national rejuvenation. Fascists often advocate for the establishment of a totalitarian one-party state, and for a dirigiste economy (a market economy in which the state plays a strong directive role through economic interventionist policies), with the principal goal of achieving autarky (national economic self-sufficiency). Fascism's extreme authoritarianism and nationalism often manifest as a belief in racial purity or a master race, usually blended with some variant of racism or discrimination against a demonized \"Other\", such as Jews, homosexuals, transgender people, ethnic minorities, or immigrants. These ideas have motivated fascist regimes to commit massacres, forced sterilizations, deportations, and genocides. During World War II, the actions of the fascist Axis powers, with their genocidal and imperialist ambitions, caused the death of millions of people. Since the end of World War II in 1945, fascism as an ideology has been largely disgraced, and few parties have openly described themselves as fascist; the term is often used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions of neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes employed to describe contemporary parties with ideologies similar to, or rooted in 20th-century fascist movements. Some opposition groups have adopted the label anti-fascist (often shortened to antifa) to signify their stance.    Etymology  The Italian term fascismo is derived from fascio, meaning 'bundle of sticks', ultimately from the Latin word fasces. This was the name given to political organizations in Italy known as fasci, groups similar to guilds or syndicates. According to Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's own account, the Fasces of Revolutionary Action were founded in Italy in 1915. In 1919, Mussolini founded the Italian Fasces of Combat in Milan, which became the National Fascist Party two years later. The fascists came to associate the term with the ancient Roman fasces or fascio littorio, a bundle of rods tied around an axe, an ancient Roman symbol of the authority of the civic magistrate carried by his lictors. The symbolism of the fasces suggested strength through unity: a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is difficult to break. Similar symbols were developed by different fascist movements: for example, the Falange symbol is five arrows joined by a yoke.    Definitions   Historians, political scientists, and other scholars have long debated the exact nature of fascism. Historian Ian Kershaw once wrote that \"trying to define 'fascism' is like trying to nail jelly to the wall.\" Each different group described as fascist has at least some unique elements, and many definitions of fascism have been criticized as either too broad or too narrow. According to many scholars, fascism—especially once in power—has historically attacked communism, conservatism, and parliamentary liberalism, attracting support primarily from the far-right. Frequently cited as a standard definition by notable scholars, such as Roger Griffin, Randall Schweller, Bo Rothstein, Federico Finchelstein, and Stephen D. Shenfield, is that of historian Stanley G. Payne. The Fascist  is a 1961 Italian film directed by Luciano Salce. It was coproduced with France. It was also the first feature film scored by Ennio Morricone. The Fascist (Italian: Il federale) is a 1961  Italian comedy-drama film directed by  Luciano Salce. It was coproduced with France. It was also the first feature film scored by Ennio Morricone.    Plot  The movie takes place in 1944, when Italy was divided between the fascist puppet state Repubblica Sociale Italiana (RSI), which retained control only of the northern half of the country, and the Allied-occupied southern half. Fascist bosses gathered in Cremona (in the far North of Italy and well away from the line of fire) pick enthusiast militant Primo Arcovazzi (played by Ugo Tognazzi) to take into custody professor Bonafè, a noted anti-fascist philosopher and agreed upon new government leader among the opposition forces who are preparing the new democratic government after the war. During a first raid at the professor's home, Arcovazzi does not recognize him and Bonafè can escape to his family residence in rural Abruzzo. The fascist is hence appointed again to capture him there, and to lead him to Rome, momentarily still controlled by the RSI. Primo does not understand that the political situation is changing and his faction is about to lose, and is easily lured by the promise of a promotion; while for his superiors, his tardiness and naive fascist faith make him an ideal expendable candidate for the mission. Equipped with a motorcycle-sidecar combination Arcovazzi manages to capture the professor and the two head back towards Rome. Along the way they have a small accident to avoid running over a girl (Stefania Sandrelli), who turns out to be a confidence trickster and petty thief. They share part of the way after the motorcycle is wrecked, but the girl disappears after having scammed the professor out of 150 lire. Arcovazzi asks for assistance with his vehicle to a truckload of Wehrmacht soldiers passing by. But his sidecar gets confiscated and the two are taken prisoner by the German forces, who immediately recognize the professor for his academic fame and a have him in a Gestapo list of wanted men, due to a publication opposing the persecution of Jews. The couple manage to escape thanks to Bonafè's ability to improvise an explosive formula, and taking advantage of confusion during an allied air raid. They don German uniforms to pass unnoticed during the commotion and get momentarily separated. Later they reunite and again, while Arcovazzi is stealing a Schwimmwagen in order to continue his mission of delivering Bonafè to fascist authorities in Rome, the professor tries in vain to desert him. The following night the two men stop to sleep in a barn, and they meet again by chance the thieving girl. She is afraid but the trio eventually reconcile over the attempts to capture and cook a chicken for dinner. In the morning the girl wakes up first and leaves with all of Arcovazzi's and Bonafè's clothes and accessories, except for their Schwimmwagen. Depressed by the events but still faithful to his mission, Arcovazzi tries to continue. He attempts to ford a stream, trusting in the Schwimmwagen's amphibious qualities but, due to previous damage or his own ineptitude, the vehicle sinks. Upon eventually reaching a village on foot, Arcovazzi tries to ask for help at the local fascist party cell (\"Casa del Fascio\"). The place is however deserted, and the only people around are a couple of teenagers, armed and brain-washed by fascist propaganda. Arcovazzi is questioned to prove his knowledge of fascist lore, and kept at gun point until able to prove his trustworthiness. Only professor Bonafè's help in answering the last question allows him to answer the last challenge and to avoid being shot. But even after gaining the teenagers' trust, there is no support to be had and Arcovazzi is only able to confiscating a tandem bicycle and a pistol, again to resume his struggle of delivering Bonafè as prisoner in Rome. Again the duo has to stop when bursting a tire, in the neighborhood of the town of Rocca Sabina. Arcovazzi recognizes it as the home of (fictitious) nationalist poet Arcangelo Bardacci, whom he idolizes and whose writings (which he can quote verbatim) prompted him to become a fascist. Upon reaching the poet's house, he is told however that the poet had joined the Royal Italian Army in Albania and perished in the struggle. In reality Bardacci is alive and hiding in the house, biding his time hiding in the cellar until the regime he once endorsed finally collapses. Arcovazzi is oblivious to the false tale and accepts hospitality in the poet's house, while Bonafè discovers the truth and is allowed to escape in exchange of a promise to assist with Bardacci's political rehabilitation in the future. Luciano Salce (25 September 1922, in Rome – 17 December 1989, in Rome) was an Italian film director, actor and lyricist. His 1962 film \"Le pillole di Ercole\" was shown as part of a retrospective on Italian comedy at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. As a writer of pop music, he used the pseudonym Pilantra. During World War II, he was a prisoner in Germany. He later worked for several years in Brazil. == Selected filmography ==\n\n\n=== Director ===\n\n\n=== Actor ===\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAndrea Pergolari, Verso la commedia.

Anti-fascism is a political movement in opposition to fascist ideologies, groups and individuals. Beginning in European countries in the 1920s, it was at its most significant shortly before and during World War II, where the Axis powers were opposed by many countries forming the Allies of World War II and dozens of resistance movements worldwide. Anti-fascism has been an element of movements across the political spectrum and holding many different political positions such as anarchism, communism, pacifism, republicanism, social democracy, socialism and syndicalism as well as centrist, conservative, liberal and nationalist viewpoints. Fascism, a far-right ultra-nationalistic ideology best known for its use by the Italian Fascists and the Nazis, became prominent beginning in the 1910s. Organization against fascism began around 1920. Fascism became the state ideology of Italy in 1922 and of Germany in 1933, spurring a large increase in anti-fascist action, including German resistance to Nazism and the Italian resistance movement. Anti-fascism was a major aspect of the Spanish Civil War, which foreshadowed World War II. Before World War II, the West had not taken seriously the threat of fascism, and anti-fascism was sometimes associated with communism. However, the outbreak of World War II greatly changed Western perceptions, and fascism was seen as an existential threat by not only the communist Soviet Union but also by the liberal-democratic United States and United Kingdom. The Axis Powers of World War II were generally fascist, and the fight against them was characterized in anti-fascist terms. Resistance during World War II to fascism occurred in every occupied country, and came from across the ideological spectrum. The defeat of the Axis powers generally ended fascism as a state ideology. After World War II, the anti-fascist movement continued to be active in places where organized fascism continued or re-emerged. There was a resurgence of antifa in Germany in the 1980s, as a response to the invasion of the punk scene by neo-Nazis. This influenced the antifa movement in the United States in the late 1980s and 1990s, which was similarly carried by punks. In the 21st century, this greatly increased in prominence as a response to the resurgence of the radical right, especially after the election of Donald Trump.    Origins   With the development and spread of Italian Fascism, i.e. the original fascism, the National Fascist Party's ideology was met with increasingly militant opposition by Italian communists and socialists. Organizations such as Arditi del Popolo and the Italian Anarchist Union emerged between 1919 and 1921, to combat the nationalist and fascist surge of the post-World War I period. In the words of historian Eric Hobsbawm, as fascism developed and spread, a \"nationalism of the left\" developed in those nations threatened by Italian irredentism (e.g. in the Balkans, and Albania in particular). After the outbreak of World War II, the Albanian and Yugoslav resistances were instrumental in antifascist action and underground resistance. This combination of irreconcilable nationalisms and leftist partisans constitute the earliest roots of European anti-fascism. Less militant forms of anti-fascism arose later. During the 1930s in Britain, \"Christians – especially the Church of England – provided both a language of opposition to fascism and inspired anti-fascist action\". French philosopher Georges Bataille believed that Friedrich Nietzsche was a forerunner of anti-fascism due to his derision for nationalism and racism.  Michael Seidman argues that traditionally anti-fascism was seen as the purview of the political left but that in recent years this has been questioned. Seidman identifies two types of anti-fascism, namely revolutionary and counterrevolutionary:  Revolutionary anti-fascism was expressed amongst communists and anarchists, where it identified fascism and capitalism as its enemies and made little distinction between fascism and other forms of right-wing authoritarianism. It did not disappear after the Second World War but was used as an official ideology of the Soviet bloc, with the \"fascist\" West as the new enemy. Counterrevolutionary anti-fascism was much more conservative in nature, with Seidman arguing that Charles de Gaulle and Winston Churchill represented examples of it and that they tried to win the masses to their cause. Counterrevolutionary antifascists desired to ensure the restoration or continuation of the prewar old regime and conservative antifascists disliked fascism's erasure of the distinction between the public and private spheres. Like its revolutionary counterpart, it would outlast fascism once the Second World War ended. Seidman argues that despite the differences between these two strands of anti-fascism, there were similarities. They would both come to regard violent expansion as intrinsic to the fascist project.

He is currently the director of the Peabody Essex Museum. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia( Canberra) from 1997- 2004. David Emory( born 1949) is an American talk radio host and anti-fascist, born in New York City, based in the San Francisco Bay Area. He is known for his radio show which purports to uncover neo-fascism and neo-Nazism; among his more notable claims is that the Bush family was connected to the Third Reich. Fascist Italy is a term which is used to describe the Kingdom of Italy when it was governed by the National Fascist Party from 1922 to 1943 with Benito Mussolini as prime minister and dictator. The Italian Fascists imposed totalitarian rule and they also crushed political opposition, while they simultaneously promoted economic modernization, traditional social values and a rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church. According to historian Stanley G. Payne, \"[the] Fascist government passed through several relatively distinct phases\". The first phase (1922–1925) was nominally a continuation of the parliamentary system, albeit with a \"legally-organized executive dictatorship\". In foreign policy, Mussolini ordered the Pacification of Libya against rebels in the Italian colonies of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica (eventually unified in Italian Libya), inflicted the bombing of Corfu, established a protectorate over Albania, and annexed the city of Fiume into Italy after a treaty with Yugoslavia. The second phase (1925–1929) was \"the construction of the Fascist dictatorship proper\". The third phase (1929–1935) saw less interventionism in foreign policy. The fourth phase (1935–1940) was characterized by an aggressive foreign policy: the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, which was launched from Eritrea and Somaliland; confrontations with the League of Nations, leading to sanctions; growing economic autarky; the invasion of Albania; and the signing of the Pact of Steel. The fifth phase (1940–1943) was World War II itself ending in military defeat, while the sixth and final phase (1943–1945) was the rump Salò Government under German control. Italy was a leading member of the Axis powers in World War II, battling with initial success on several fronts. However, after the German-Italian defeat in Africa, the successes of the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, and the subsequent Allied landings in Sicily, King Victor Emmanuel III overthrew and arrested Mussolini. The new government signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943. Nazi Germany seized control of the northern half of Italy and rescued Mussolini, setting up the Italian Social Republic (RSI), a collaborationist puppet state which was ruled by Mussolini and Fascist loyalists. From that point onward, the country descended into civil war, and the large Italian resistance movement continued to wage its guerrilla war against the German and RSI forces. Mussolini was captured and killed by the resistance on 28 April 1945, and hostilities ended the next day. Shortly after the war, civil discontent led to the 1946 institutional referendum on whether Italy would remain a monarchy or become a republic. The Italians decided to abandon the monarchy and form the Italian Republic, the present-day Italian state.    Culture and society  After rising to power, the Fascist regime of Italy set a course to becoming a one-party state and to integrate Fascism into all aspects of life. A totalitarian state was officially declared in the Doctrine of Fascism of 1935: The Fascist conception of the State is all-embracing; outside of it no human or spiritual values can exist, much less have value. Thus understood, Fascism is totalitarian, and the Fascist State—a synthesis and a unit inclusive of all values—interprets, develops, and potentiates the whole life of a people.— Doctrine of Fascism, 1935 With the concept of totalitarianism, Benito Mussolini and the Fascist regime set an agenda of improving Italian culture and society based on ancient Rome, personal dictatorship and some futurist aspects of Italian intellectuals and artists. Under Fascism, the definition of the Italian nationality was to rest on a militarist foundation and the Fascist's \"new man\" ideal, in which loyal Italians would rid themselves of individualism and autonomy and see themselves as a component of the Italian state and be prepared to sacrifice their lives for it. Under such a totalitarian government, only Fascists would be considered \"true Italians\", and membership and endorsement of the Fascist Party was necessary for people to gain \"Complete Citizenship\"; those who did not swear allegiance to Fascism would be banished from public life and could not gain employment. The Fascist government also reached out to Italians living overseas to endorse the Fascist cause and identify with Italy rather than their places of residence. Despite efforts to mould a new culture for fascism, Fascist Italy's efforts were not as drastic or successful in comparison to other one-party states like Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in creating a new culture. Mussolini's propaganda idolized him as the nation's saviour, and the Fascist regime attempted to make him omnipresent in Italian society. Much of Fascism's appeal in Italy was based on Mussolini's popularity and charisma. Italian fascism (Italian: fascismo italiano), also classical fascism and Fascism, is the original fascist ideology, which Giovanni Gentile and Benito Mussolini developed in Italy. The ideology of Italian Fascism is associated with a series of political parties led by Mussolini: the National Fascist Party (PNF), which governed the Kingdom of Italy from 1922 until 1943, and the Republican Fascist Party (PFR), which governed the Italian Social Republic from 1943 to 1945. Italian fascism also is associated with the post–war Italian Social Movement (MSI) and later Italian neo-fascist political organisations. Italian fascism originated from ideological combinations of ultranationalism and Italian nationalism, national syndicalism and revolutionary nationalism, and from the militarism of Italian irredentism to regain \"lost overseas territories of Italy\" deemed necessary to restore Italian nationalist pride. Italian Fascists also claimed that modern Italy was an heiress to the imperial legacy of Ancient Rome, and that there existed historical proof which supported the creation of an Imperial Fascist Italy to provide spazio vitale (vital space) for the Second Italo-Senussi War of Italian settler colonisation en route to establishing hegemonic control of the terrestrial basin of the Mediterranean Sea. Italian fascism promoted a corporatist economic system, whereby employer and employee syndicates are linked together in associations to collectively represent the nation's economic producers and work alongside the state to set national economic policy. This economic system intended to resolve class conflict through collaboration between the classes. Italian fascism opposed liberalism, especially classical liberalism, which fascist leaders denounced as \"the debacle of individualism\". Fascism was opposed to socialism because of the latter's frequent opposition to nationalism, but it was also opposed to the reactionary conservatism developed by Joseph de Maistre. It believed the success of Italian nationalism required respect for tradition and a clear sense of a shared past among the Italian people, alongside a commitment to a modernised Italy. Originally, many Italian fascists were opposed to Nazism, as fascism in Italy did not espouse Nordicism nor, initially, the antisemitism inherent in Nazi ideology; however, many fascists, in particular Mussolini himself, held racist ideas (specifically anti-Slavism) that were enshrined into law as official policy over the course of fascist rule. As Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany grew politically closer in the latter half of the 1930s, Italian laws and policies became explicitly antisemitic due to pressure from Nazi Germany (even though antisemitic laws were not commonly enforced in Italy), including the passage of the Italian racial laws. When the fascists were in power, they also persecuted some linguistic minorities in Italy. In addition, the Greeks in Dodecanese and Northern Epirus, which were then under Italian occupation and influence, were persecuted.    Principal beliefs     Nationalism   Italian fascism is based upon Italian nationalism and in particular seeks to complete what it considers as the incomplete project of Risorgimento by incorporating Italia Irredenta (unredeemed Italy) into the state of Italy. The National Fascist Party (PNF) founded in 1921 declared that the party was to serve as \"a revolutionary militia placed at the service of the nation. It follows a policy based on three principles: order, discipline, hierarchy\".  It identifies modern Italy as the heir to the Roman Empire and Italy during the Renaissance and promotes the cultural identity of Romanitas (Roman-ness). Italian fascism historically sought to forge a strong Italian Empire as a Third Rome, identifying ancient Rome as the First Rome and Renaissance-era Italy as the Second Rome. Italian fascism has emulated ancient Rome and Mussolini in particular emulated ancient Roman leaders, such as Julius Caesar as a model for the fascists' rise to power and Augustus as a model for empire-building. Italian fascism has directly promoted imperialism, such as within the Doctrine of Fascism (1932), ghostwritten by Giovanni Gentile on behalf of Mussolini: The Fascist state is a will to power and empire. The Roman tradition is here a powerful force. According to the Doctrine of Fascism, an empire is not only a territorial or military or mercantile concept, but a spiritual and moral one. One can think of an empire, that is, a nation, which directly or indirectly guides other nations, without the need to conquer a single square kilometre of territory.    Irredentism and expansionism   Fascism emphasized the need for the restoration of the Mazzinian Risorgimento tradition that followed the unification of Italy, that the fascists claimed had been left incomplete and abandoned in the Giolittian-era Italy. Peter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre. Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV. Ennio Morricone  (Italian: [ˈɛnnjo morriˈkoːne]; 10 November 1928 – 6 July 2020) was an Italian composer, orchestrator, conductor, trumpeter, and pianist who wrote music in a wide range of styles. With more than 400 scores for cinema and television, as well as more than 100 classical works, Morricone is widely considered one of the most prolific and greatest film composers of all time. He received numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, three Grammy Awards, three Golden Globes, six BAFTAs, ten David di Donatello, eleven Nastro d'Argento, two European Film Awards, the Golden Lion Honorary Award, and the Polar Music Prize in 2010.  His filmography includes more than 70 award-winning films, all Sergio Leone's films since A Fistful of Dollars, all Giuseppe Tornatore's films since Cinema Paradiso, Dario Argento's Animal Trilogy, as well as The Battle of Algiers (1968), 1900 (1976), La Cage aux Folles (1978), Le Professionnel (1981), The Thing (1982), and Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (1989). He received Academy Award for Best Original Score nominations for Days of Heaven (1978), The Mission (1986), The Untouchables (1987), Bugsy (1991), Malèna (2000) and The Hateful Eight (2015), winning for the latter. He won the Academy Honorary Award in 2007. His score to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) is regarded as one of the most recognizable and influential soundtracks in history. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.  After playing the trumpet in jazz bands in the 1940s, he became a studio arranger for RCA Victor and in 1955 started ghost writing for film and theatre. Throughout his career, he composed music for artists such as Paul Anka, Mina, Milva, Zucchero, and Andrea Bocelli. From 1960 to 1975, Morricone gained international fame for composing music for Westerns and—with an estimated 10 million copies sold—Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the best-selling scores worldwide. From 1966 to 1980, he was a main member of Il Gruppo, one of the first experimental composers collectives, and in 1969 he co-founded Forum Music Village, a prestigious recording studio. He continued to compose music for European productions, such as Marco Polo, La piovra, Nostromo, Fateless, Karol, and En mai, fais ce qu'il te plait.  Morricone composed for Hollywood directors such as Don Siegel, Mike Nichols, Brian De Palma, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Warren Beatty, John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino. He has also worked with directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci, Mauro Bolognini, Giuliano Montaldo, Roland Joffé, Roman Polanski, Henri Verneuil, Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi, Gillo Pontecorvo, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. His best-known compositions include \"The Ecstasy of Gold\", \"Se telefonando\", \"Man with a Harmonica\", \"Here's to You\", \"Chi Mai\", \"Gabriel's Oboe\", and \"E Più Ti Penso\". He has influenced many artists including Hans Zimmer, Danger Mouse, Dire Straits, Muse, Metallica, Fields of the Nephilim, and Radiohead.    Early life and education  Morricone was born in Rome, the son of Libera Ridolfi and Mario Morricone, a musician. At the time of his birth Italy was under fascist rule. Morricone had four siblings — Adriana, Aldo, Maria, and Franca — and lived in Trastevere in the centre of Rome. His father was a professional trumpeter who performed in light-music orchestras while his mother set up a small textile business. During his early schooldays, Morricone was also a classmate of his later collaborator Sergio Leone. Morricone's father first taught him to read music and to play several instruments. He entered the Saint Cecilia Conservatory to take trumpet lessons under the guidance of Umberto Semproni. He formally entered the conservatory in 1940 at age 12, enrolling in a four-year harmony program that he completed within six months.

Film preservation, or film restoration, describes a series of ongoing efforts among film historians, archivists, museums, cinematheques, and non-profit organizations to rescue decaying film stock and preserve the images they contain. In the widest sense, preservation assures that a movie will continue to exist in as close to its original form as possible.

Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV. Howard Green Duff (November 24, 1913 – July 8, 1990) was an American actor.    Early life  Duff was born in Charleston, Washington (today a part of Bremerton), in 1913. He graduated from Roosevelt High School in Seattle in 1932, where he began acting in school plays after he was cut from the school basketball team. Duff worked locally in Seattle-area theater until entering the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. He was eventually assigned to their radio service, and announced re-broadcasts prepared for the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). In this role, he served as the announcer for the drama Suspense, dated March 16, 1943.    Career     Sam Spade  Duff's most memorable radio role was as Dashiell Hammett's private eye Sam Spade in The Adventures of Sam Spade (1946–1950). Due to accusations of Duff being a communist and with his TV and film career starting to take hold, he ultimately left the program in 1950 at the start of its final season; Stephen Dunne took over the voice role of Spade.    Contract with Universal  Duff was signed to a long-term contract with Universal, and made his film debut alongside Burt Lancaster as an inmate in 1947's Brute Force. The movie was produced by Mark Hellinger and directed by Jules Dassin, who gave Duff a bigger role in their next film, The Naked City (1948). He subsequently reunited with Lancaster for the family drama All My Sons (also 1948), based on the play of the same name by Arthur Miller. More substantial roles soon followed, with Duff taking the lead in numerous Westerns and films noir including Illegal Entry, Red Canyon, Johnny Stool Pigeon, Calamity Jane and Sam Bass (all 1949);Spy Hunt, Shakedown and Woman in Hiding (all 1950). The latter film saw Duff act alongside his future wife Ida Lupino; the couple would subsequently co-star in a further four films during the 1950s. In 1951, Duff made a pilot for a new radio series, The McCoy. Following his marriage to Lupino in October 1951, Duff was granted a release from his contract with Universal.    Freelance actor  Duff appeared in the 1952 film That Kind of Girl (aka Models Inc), and also featured in Spaceways, and Roar of the Crowd (both 1953), the latter for Monogram Pictures, which ultimately made Jennifer (also 1953), the second movie in which he starred alongside his wife. His other film appearances beside his wife; Don Siegel's Private Hell 36 (1954); Lewis Seiler's Women's Prison (1955), and Fritz Lang's While the City Sleeps (1956) continued Duff's successful run of movies during the 1950s.    Television  In addition to his movie roles, Duff also experienced success in television, with appearances in the 1950s series The Star and the Story, Climax! and Crossroads. From January 1957 to July 1958, he appeared with Lupino in the CBS sitcom Mr. Adams and Eve, which revolved around the private lives of two fictitious film stars, Howard Adams and Eve Drake, who were married to each other. They also served as producers. Other TV roles included an appearance in NBC's Western series Bonanza, playing a young Samuel Langhorne Clemens in his early life in the West as a satirical and crusading journalist, in the first-season episode \"Enter Mark Twain\". Duff also featured in episodes of numerous TV series during the 1960s including The Twilight Zone, Burke's Law, Combat! (episode “Missing in Action”), The Eleventh Hour, Mr. Novak and Batman (episode \"The Entrancing Dr. Cassandra\", alongside wife Ida Lupino). In 1960, Duff portrayed Arthur Curtis on The Twilight Zone in an episode titled “A World of Difference.” In 1963 Duff appeared as Ed Frazer on The Virginian in the episode titled \"A Distant Fury.\": 428  Duff had the lead role in the short-lived TV series Dante (which ran for only one season; 1960–61), but found greater success as Detective Sergeant Sam Stone in the ABC police drama Felony Squad (1966–69). Duff appeared in all 73 episodes of the series during its three-season run, alongside his co-stars Dennis Cole and Ben Alexander. Steve Cochran (born Robert Alexander Cochran, May 25, 1917 – June 15, 1965) was an American film, television and stage actor. He attended the University of Wyoming. After a stint working as a cowboy, Cochran developed his acting skills in local theatre and gradually progressed to Broadway, film and television.    Early life and career  Cochran was born in Eureka, California, but grew up in Laramie, Wyoming, the son of a logger. While he appeared in high school plays, he spent more time delving into athletics, particularly basketball.  After stints as a cowpuncher and railroad station hand, he studied at the University of Wyoming, where he also played basketball. Impulsively, he quit college in 1937 and went straight to Hollywood to become a star.    Theatre  Cochran performed in plays for the Federal Theatre Project in Detroit. Cochran was rejected for military service in World War II because of a heart murmur, but he directed and performed in plays at various Army camps.  He was appearing with Constance Bennett in a touring production of Without Love in December 1943 when he was signed by Sam Goldwyn. On Broadway, Cochran appeared in Hickory Stick (1944).    Hollywood     Sam Goldwyn  Samuel Goldwyn brought Cochran to Hollywood in 1945. Goldwyn made only a few films a year, so he loaned Cochran to Columbia Pictures for Booked on Suspicion (1945), a Boston Blackie movie. Goldwyn then put him in Wonder Man (1945), a Danny Kaye movie co-starring Virginia Mayo and Vera-Ellen in which Cochran played a gangster. Columbia then used him in another Boston Blackie film, Blackie's Rendezvous (1945), in which he played a villain, and in The Gay Senorita (1945) with Jinx Falkenburg. Goldwyn then used Cochran in another Danny Kaye movie with Mayo and Vera-Ellen, The Kid from Brooklyn (1946). After United Artists borrowed him to play a gangster in The Chase (1946), Cochran appeared in the prestigious drama The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), playing a man who has an affair with a woman played by Virginia Mayo that continues even after her husband (played by Dana Andrews) returns from war. The movie was a huge critical and commercial success.  Cochran had a supporting role opposite Groucho Marx in Copacabana (1947) for United Artists. Goldwyn got him to play another gangster opposite Kaye and Mayo in A Song is Born (1948), directed by Howard Hawks.  He made his TV debut in \"Dinner at Antoine's\" for The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse (1949) and followed this with \"Tin Can Skipper\" for NBC Presents (1949). He then returned to Broadway to support Mae West in a shortlived revival of her play Diamond Lil. This revived Hollywood's interest in him.    Warner Bros.  In 1949, Cochran went over to Warner Bros., playing Big Ed Somers, a power-hungry henchman to James Cagney's psychotic mobster in White Heat (1949) opposite Virginia Mayo. Warner Bros. eventually took over Cochran's and Mayo's contracts from Goldwyn. Cochran supported Joan Crawford in The Damned Don't Cry (1950), after which he was given his first lead role, in Highway 301 (1950), playing a gangster. He was a villain to Gary Cooper's hero in Dallas (1950) and played a Ku Klux Klan member in Storm Warning (1951) with Ginger Rogers and Doris Day. Cochran was a villain in Canyon Pass (1951), a western, and then was given the lead in Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison (1951), which inspired Johnny Cash to write his song \"Folsom Prison Blues\". Warners gave him another lead in Tomorrow Is Another Day (1951), a film noir with Ruth Roman that was originally intended for Burt Lancaster. He returned to supporting parts in Jim Thorpe – All-American (1951) with Burt Lancaster. Warners starred him in The Tanks Are Coming (1951) and in a rare sympathetic role in The Lion and the Horse (1952). He co-starred with Cornel Wilde in Operation Secret (1952) and supported Virginia Mayo in She's Back on Broadway (1953). In The Desert Song (1953), Cochran played Gordon Macrae's rival for Kathryn Grayson. Two Mules for Sister Sara is a 1970 American-Mexican Western film in Panavision directed by Don Siegel and starring Shirley MacLaine and Clint Eastwood set during the French intervention in Mexico (1861–1867). The film was to have been the first in a five-year exclusive association between Universal Pictures and Sanen Productions of Mexico. It was the second of five collaborations between Siegel and Eastwood, following Coogan's Bluff (1968). The collaboration continued with The Beguiled and Dirty Harry (both 1971) and finally Escape from Alcatraz (1979). The plot follows an American mercenary who gets mixed up with a nun and aids a group of Juarista rebels during the puppet reign of Emperor Maximilian in Mexico. The film featured both American and Mexican actors and actresses, including being filmed in the picturesque countryside near Tlayacapan, Morelos. Ennio Morricone composed the film's music. Two Mules for Sister Sara was a moderate financial success and received a warm critical reception.    Plot  Just after the American Civil War, a former Northern soldier named Hogan rides up on a naked woman about to be raped by bandits. He kills the bandits, and the woman dons a habit, revealing herself as a nun. Sister Sara begs his continuing protection from French soldiers who are tracking her as a known Juarista, raising money to assist Mexican revolutionaries fighting French occupying forces. When Sara requests that Hogan take her to the Mexican camp, he is at first hesitant to deviate from his plans, declaring that if she were not a nun he would let her fend for herself. Learning that she has knowledge of the French garrison where she has ostensibly taught Spanish to the French soldiers, Hogan agrees to escort her there, as he had previously arranged to help the revolutionaries attack the French garrison in exchange for half the garrison's treasury. As the duo heads towards the camp, evading French troops all the while, Hogan is surprised that the nun swears and drinks whiskey. While on their way to destroy a French ammunition train, Hogan is shot at by Yaquis and seriously wounded with an arrow. To anesthetize him while removing the arrow from his shoulder, Sara plies Hogan with whiskey, making him drunk in the process. Due to his injured shoulder, Hogan cannot climb the trestle. When Sara declares she cannot climb the high trestle herself to set the charges, Hogan reminds her of her debt to him in saving her life, and she  reluctantly complies, enabling them to successfully blow up the train. In his drunken stupor, Hogan bitterly reveals to Sara that he is attracted to her and resents her being a nun.  Eventually the two reach Juarista commander Col. Beltran's camp. In the lead-up to the attack, Sara begs the local villagers for money needed to purchase dynamite for the assault on the garrison, enlisting the help of prostitutes at a brothel. When Hogan is shocked that she would take them to a brothel, Sara reveals to Hogan that she is not a nun, but a prostitute and a Juarista wanted for shooting a French lieutenant. She posed as a nun initially for protection as a woman travelling alone and later because of Hogan’s initial stated reluctance to protect her had she not been a nun. Although Hogan is shocked, resenting all the chaste nights they spent together travelling, he kisses her and declares it is a bad time to indulge. The two team up to infiltrate the fort and let a squad of revolutionaries in through a trapdoor, while two other squads attack the gates and a fourth act as sharpshooters. Expecting the French army to be drunk for Bastille Day, they instead find that the train's destruction has put the garrison on high alert. Hogan and Sara infiltrate the fortress by Hogan posing as a bounty hunter who has captured Sara and is turning her in for the reward. The ruse works, and Hogan and Sara engage the French commanding officers while the garrison's gates are breached for the Mexican revolutionaries to swarm through. A battle ensues; the French are defeated, and the Mexicans capture the fort. As promised, Hogan receives half the riches. Now wealthy and with his job completed, Hogan sets off with Sara, now wearing a garish red silk gown and feathers instead of the habit, the romantic couple now intending to open a gambling house in San Francisco.    Cast  Shirley MacLaine as Sara Clint Eastwood as Hogan Manolo Fábregas as Col. Beltrán Alberto Morin as Gen. Rough Cut is a 1980 American heist film written by Larry Gelbart, directed by Don Siegel, and starring Burt Reynolds, Lesley-Anne Down and David Niven. It was based on the novel Touch the Lion's Paw (1975) by Derek Lambert.    Plot  Jack Rhodes, a rich American living in London, attends a party and meets Gillian Bromley, an attractive woman who is also a thief. Rhodes observes Gillian stealing diamond jewelry from the house and later discovers Gillian hiding in his apartment. The two are attracted to one another and slowly begin a romantic relationship. Gillian confesses that she steals for the thrill, and also displays her skills at high speed driving. Gillian is being coerced by Chief Inspector Willis, a veteran Scotland Yard detective who knows Jack is really a diamond thief and is determined to catch him before his impending retirement. Willis uses Gillian to feed Jack information regarding a shipment of uncut diamonds from London to Antwerp in order to bait Jack into stealing them so that he can capture him in the act. Jack however sees through Gillian's story regarding her source of information and exposes her, after which she tells Jack all about Willis and his plan to capture him. Despite knowing about the setup, Jack recruits a team to help him steal the diamonds. He dislikes his initial choice of getaway driver, a mercenary living in Amsterdam, and recruits Gillian as replacement. On the eve of the robbery Jack confesses his love for Gillian. The robbery goes ahead as planned, Jack's team divert the private jet carrying the diamonds to Amsterdam, where he and Gillian intercept the shipment and escape following a high speed car chase. Meanwhile, Willis, who had travelled to Antwerp, discovers that a duplicate plane flown by Jack's team has delivered a package of worthless quartz and retires in disgrace. Jack and Gillian are celebrating aboard a yacht when he reveals that the diamonds that they stole from Amsterdam were also quartz, switched for the real diamonds by Willis, who then joins them to negotiate the sale of the diamonds to Jack. Jack reveals that he and Willis had been working together all along, using Gillian as intermediary.    Cast     Production     Development  The film was based on the novel, Touch the Lion's Paw published in 1975. The New York Times said \"The book has a lot to offer, if only for the planning of the caper.\" In 1977 it was announced Burt Reynolds would star in a film of the book called Rough Cut based on a script by Larry Gelbart, produced by David Merrick and directed by Blake Edwards. Reynolds and Merrick had worked together on Semi-Tough and Merrick asked the actor what sort of film he would like to do; Reynolds wanted to do a \"homage\" to Cary Grant. \"Even if it didnt turn out well I'd get to throw away my Levis and cowboy hat and wear some decent clothes for a change,\" the actor said. Gelbart said when he came on to the film another writer had already done a script and Merrick hired him at the request of Reynolds, who had writer and director approval, and was an admirer of Gelbart's. \"My favourite writers have always come out of TV,\" said Reynolds. \"They don't usually have ego problems and they're used to writing under the gun.\" Gelbart wrote a draft of the script which Reynolds called \"brilliant\", but Blake Edwards did not like it and Gelbart was fired off the project in February 1978. Then Edwards left the project. Gelbart says Reynolds wanted to push back production of the film to do Starting Over and Merrick agreed provided Reynolds give up writer and director approval. This was done. \"I hope it was worth it,\" said Reynolds, \"but I knew Starting Over would be important for me.\" Merrick hired four other writers to work on the film. Then, at Reynolds' behest, Gelbart was rehired in June 1979. He did three more drafts in collaboration with Reynolds and new director Don Siegel. Siegel agreed to do the film because he was afraid of being typecast as an action director. \"I thought I'd have a ball,\" he said.    Shooting  Filming began in London in August 1979. Siegel said at the time, \"If I'd known Escape from Alcatraz was going to be such a success, I don't think I'd have done this picture. But because I love England I thought I'd have a go. But it's been a disaster since day one.\" Siegel said the original book was \"poor\" and \"we've had at least seven writers on it... It's not nearly as good as it should be and a great deal of work is needed to shore it up.\" Siegel said \"this picture is as big a departure\" for Reynolds \"as it is for me. It's more in the genre of a Cary Grant movie... Coogan's Bluff is a 1968 American crime thriller film directed and produced by Don Siegel. It stars Clint Eastwood, Susan Clark, Don Stroud, Tisha Sterling, Betty Field and Lee J. Cobb. The film marks the first of five collaborations between Siegel and Eastwood, which continued with Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), The Beguiled (1971), Dirty Harry (1971) and Escape from Alcatraz (1979). Eastwood plays the part of a veteran deputy sheriff from a rural county in Arizona who travels to New York City to extradite an apprehended fugitive named Jimmy Ringerman, played by Stroud, who is wanted for murder. The name of the film itself is a reference to a New York City natural landmark, Coogan's Bluff, a promontory in upper Manhattan overlooking the site of the former long-time home of the New York Giants baseball club, the Polo Grounds, with a double-meaning derived from the name of the lead character.    Plot  Arizona deputy sheriff Walt Coogan is sent to New York City to extradite escaped killer James Ringerman. Detective Lieutenant McElroy informs him that Ringerman is recovering from an overdose of LSD, cannot be moved until the doctors release him, and that Coogan needs to get extradition papers from the New York State Supreme Court. Coogan flirts with probation officer Julie Roth and takes her out for lunch. He goes to the prison hospital and bluffs his way to Ringerman, tricks the attendants into turning him over, and sets out to catch a plane for Arizona. Before he can get to the airport, Ringerman's girlfriend Linny and a tavern owner named Pushie ambush Coogan and enable Ringerman to escape. Detective McElroy is furious with Coogan and warns him against playing policeman in New York. Coogan learns Linny's name from a visit to Ringerman's mother. While he is at Roth's apartment for a home cooked supper Coogan learns that Roth is Linny's probation officer and he finds Linny's address in Roth's home files while Roth is in the kitchen cooking them supper. He tracks Linny to a nightclub, where she offers to lead him to Ringerman. Instead she takes Coogan to a pool hall where he is attacked by Pushie and a dozen men in a bloody battle. Coogan holds his own for a while but is eventually overpowered. After hearing sirens the men take off, but not before the beaten Coogan kills Pushie and two others. Detective McElroy finds the bar in pieces and a cowboy hat on the floor. Coogan finds Linny and threatens to kill her if she does not lead him to Ringerman. She takes him to Ringerman who is hiding out at the Cloisters. He is armed with a gun stolen from Coogan. Ringerman gets away on his motorcycle and Coogan commandeers a motorcycle of his own. Coogan gives chase through Fort Tryon Park and eventually captures Ringerman. He hands the fugitive over to McElroy, who once again tells him to go to the DA's office and to let \"the system handle this.\" Some time later Coogan, with Ringerman in cuffs, prepares to leave for the airport via helicopter from the helipad atop the Pan Am building. At the last minute Julie Roth runs up to the helicopter to give Coogan a long good-bye kiss. Coogan's last view is Julie Roth waving goodbye from the helipad as the helicopter lifts off.    Cast     Production  Before Hang 'Em High had been released, Eastwood had set to work on Coogan's Bluff, a project which saw him reunite with Universal Studios after an offer of $1 million, more than doubling his previous salary. Jennings Lang was responsible for the deal. Lang was a former agent of Don Siegel, a Universal contract director who was invited to direct Eastwood's second major American film. Eastwood was not familiar with Siegel's work but Lang arranged for them to meet at Clint's residence in Carmel. Eastwood had seen three of Siegel's earlier films, was impressed with his directing and the two became friends, forming a close partnership in the years that followed. The idea for Coogan's Bluff originated in early 1967 as a TV series and the first draft was drawn up by Herman Miller and Jack Laird, screenwriters for Rawhide. It is about a character named Sheriff Walt Coogan, a lonely deputy sheriff working in New York City. After Siegel and Eastwood had agreed to work together, Howard Rodman and three other writers were hired to devise a new script as the new team scouted for locations including New York City and the Mojave desert. However, Eastwood surprised the team one day by calling an abrupt meeting and professed to strongly dislike the script, which by now had gone through seven drafts, preferring Herman Miller's original concept.

Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a 1956 American science-fiction horror film produced by Walter Wanger, directed by Don Siegel, and starring Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter. The black-and-white film was shot in 2.00:1 Superscope and in the film noir style. Daniel Mainwaring adapted the screenplay from Jack Finney's 1954 science-fiction novel The Body Snatchers. The film was released by Allied Artists Pictures as a double feature with the British science-fiction film The Atomic Man (and in some markets with Indestructible Man). The film's storyline concerns an extraterrestrial invasion that begins in the fictional California town of Santa Mira. Alien plant spores have fallen from space and grown into large seed pods, each one capable of producing a visually identical copy of a human. As each pod reaches full development, it assimilates the physical traits, memories, and personalities of each sleeping person placed near it until only the replacement is left; these duplicates, however, are devoid of all human emotion. Little by little, a local doctor uncovers this \"quiet\" invasion and attempts to stop it. The slang expression \"pod people\" that arose in late 20th-century U.S. culture refers to the emotionless duplicates seen in the film. Invasion of the Body Snatchers was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"    Plot  A psychiatrist is called to the room of a Los Angeles hospital, where a man named Miles Bennell is being held in custody. The man claims to be a doctor, and recounts the events leading up to his arrest and arrival at the hospital. At work, Bennell meets a number of patients suffering from Capgras delusion. His girlfriend, Becky, has just come back to town after settling a divorce. The couple are called to the home of a friend of the doctor, Jack Belicec, who has found what appears to be a body in his home. It has no features or fingerprints, and starts to change, beginning to take on the features of Belicec. Another body is found in Becky's basement that is her duplicate. Before any further investigation can take place, the bodies disappear. Bennell and Jack's wife Teddy find duplicates of themselves emerging from pods in Bennell's greenhouse. They conclude that the townspeople are being replaced while asleep with copies. Bennell tries to make a call to authorities, but the operator claims that all lines are busy and he cannot be put through, so Jack and Teddy drive off to seek help in the next town over. Bennell and Becky realize that all of Santa Mira's inhabitants have been replaced and are devoid of any sort of humanity. They hide at Bennell's office for the night. Truckloads of the pods arrive downtown. Becky and Bennell listen as chief Nick Grivett directs the others to take them to towns to be planted and used to replace their populations. Kauffman and Belicec arrive at Bennell's office with pods for Becky and Bennell. It is revealed that a race of alien impostors is responsible for the invasion, and that if they aren't stopped, humanity will lose all emotions and sense of individuality. Bennell and Becky escape from the office. To avoid capture, they mimic the impostors' mannerisms and pretend to be part of the huge crowd of replaced townspeople. However, a panicked Becky screams at a near-traffic accident and her reaction exposes their humanity to the aliens. An alarm is sounded and the couple flees on foot. The couple manage to escape and hide in a mine outside town, however, after a while hiding they hear music, and Bennell leaves Becky briefly to investigate. He sees a farm with hundreds of pods being loaded onto trucks. Bennell returns to tell Becky, but realizes that she fell asleep before he could return and is now one of them. Becky sounds the alarm as Bennell runs away. Desperate, he screams at the drivers in the highway for help. Bennell finishes his story. Dr. Hill and the doctor step outside into the hallway. A driver is wheeled into the hall on a gurney after having been injured in an accident. The attendant recounts that the man had to be dug out from under a load of mysterious pods coming from Santa Mira. Dr. Hill alerts the police to block the roads in and out of Santa Mira. The film ends with Bennell relieved as Hill calls the Bureau of Investigation.    Cast   Starring Kevin McCarthy as Dr. Miles Bennell Dana Wynter as Becky Driscoll King Donovan as Jack Belicec Carolyn Jones as Theodora \"Teddy\" Belicec Featuring Larry Gates as Dr. Peter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre. Terence D. Robinson( date of birth and death unknown) was a male wrestler who competed for England. Ida Lupino (4 February 1918 – 3 August 1995) was a British actress, director, writer, and producer. Throughout her 48-year career, she appeared in 59 films and directed eight, working primarily in the United States, where she became a citizen in 1948. She is widely regarded as the most prominent female filmmaker working in the 1950s during the Hollywood studio system. With her independent production company, she co-wrote and co-produced several social-message films and became the first woman to direct a film noir, The Hitch-Hiker, in 1953. Among Lupino's other directed films, the best known are Not Wanted (1949), about unwed pregnancy (she took over for a sick director and refused directorial credit); Never Fear (1950), loosely based upon her own experiences battling paralyzing polio; Outrage (1950), one of the first films about rape; The Bigamist (1953), and The Trouble with Angels (1966). Her short yet immensely influential directorial career, tackling themes of women trapped by social conventions, usually under melodramatic or noir coverings, is a pioneering example of proto-feminist filmmaking. As an actress, Lupino's best known films are The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939) with Basil Rathbone; They Drive by Night (1940) with George Raft and Humphrey Bogart; High Sierra (1941) with Bogart; The Sea Wolf (1941) with Edward G. Robinson and John Garfield; Ladies in Retirement (1941) with Louis Hayward; Moontide (1942) with Jean Gabin; The Hard Way (1943); Deep Valley (1947) with Dane Clark; Road House (1948) with Cornel Wilde and Richard Widmark; While the City Sleeps (1956) with Dana Andrews and Vincent Price; and Junior Bonner (1972) with Steve McQueen. Lupino also directed more than 100 episodes of television shows in a variety of genres, including westerns, supernatural tales, situation comedies, murder mysteries, and gangster stories. She was the only woman to direct an episode of the original The Twilight Zone series (\"The Masks\"), and the only director to star in an episode (\"The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine\").    Early life and family   Lupino was born at 33 Ardbeg Road in Herne Hill, London, to actress Connie O'Shea (also known as Connie Emerald) and music hall comedian Stanley Lupino, a member of the theatrical Lupino family, which included Lupino Lane, a song-and-dance man. Her great-grandfather, George Hook, changed his name to Lupino. Her father, a top name in musical comedy in the UK, encouraged her to perform at an early age. He built a backyard theatre for Lupino and her sister Rita (1921–2016), who also became an actress and dancer. Lupino wrote her first play at age seven and toured with a travelling theatre company as a child. By the age of ten, Lupino had memorised the leading female roles in Shakespeare's plays. After her childhood training for stage plays, Ida's uncle Lupino Lane assisted her in moving towards film acting by getting her work as a background actress at British International Studios. She wanted to be a writer, but to please her father, Lupino enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She excelled in a number of \"bad girl\" film roles, often playing prostitutes. Lupino did not enjoy being an actress and felt uncomfortable with many of the early roles she was given. She felt that she was pushed into the profession due to her family history.    Career     Actress   Lupino made her first film appearance in The Love Race (1931) and the following year, aged 14, she worked under director Allan Dwan in Her First Affaire, in a role for which her mother had previously tested. She played leading roles in five British films in 1933 at Warner Bros.' Teddington studios and for Julius Hagen at Twickenham, including The Ghost Camera with John Mills and I Lived with You with Ivor Novello. Dubbed \"the English Jean Harlow\", she was discovered by Paramount in the 1933 film Money for Speed, playing a good girl/bad girl dual role. Lupino claimed the talent scouts saw her play only the sweet girl in the film and not the part of the prostitute, so she was asked to try out for the lead role in Alice in Wonderland (1933). When she arrived in Hollywood, the Paramount producers did not know what to make of their sultry potential leading lady, but she did get a five-year contract.

He is also recognized nationally as an erudite speaker on\" The Teachings of the Buddha.\" Donald Siegel (October 26, 1912 – April 20, 1991) was an American film director and producer. His name variously appeared in the credits of his films as both Don Siegel and Donald Siegel. He is best known for the original sci-fi film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1956), as well as five films with Clint Eastwood, including the police thriller \"Dirty Harry\" (1971) and the prison drama \"Escape from Alcatraz\" (1979), and John Wayne's final film, the 1976 Western \"The Shootist\". Donald Siegel ( SEE-gəl; October 26, 1912 – April 20, 1991) was an American film and television director and producer. Siegel was described by The New York Times as \"a director of tough, cynical and forthright action-adventure films whose taut plots centered on individualistic loners\". He directed the science-fiction horror film Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), as well as five films with Clint Eastwood, including the police thriller Dirty Harry (1971) and the prison drama Escape from Alcatraz (1979). He also directed John Wayne's final film, the Western The Shootist (1976).    Early life  Siegel was born in 1912 to a Jewish family in Chicago; his father was Samuel Siegel, a mandolin player. Siegel attended schools in New York and later graduated from Jesus College, Cambridge in England. For a short time, he studied at Beaux Arts in Paris, but left at age 20 and later went to Los Angeles.    Career  Siegel found work in the Warner Bros. film library after meeting producer Hal Wallis, and later rose to head of the montage department, where he directed thousands of montages, including the opening montage for Casablanca. In 1945, two shorts he directed, Star in the Night and Hitler Lives, won Academy Awards, which launched his career as a feature director. Siegel directed whatever material came his way, often transcending the limitations of budget and script to produce interesting and adept works. He made the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), described by The Guardian in 2014 as a \"fatalistic masterpiece\" and \"a touchstone for the sci-fi genre\" which spawned three remakes. For television, he directed two episodes of The Twilight Zone, \"Uncle Simon\" (1963) and \"The Self-Improvement of Salvadore Ross\" (1964), and was the producer of The Legend of Jesse James (1965). He worked with Eli Wallach in The Lineup, Elvis Presley and Dolores del Río in Flaming Star (1960), with Steve McQueen in Hell Is for Heroes, and Lee Marvin in the influential The Killers (1964) before directing five of Eastwood's films that were commercially successful in addition to being well received by critics. These included the action films Coogan's Bluff and Dirty Harry, the Albert Maltz-scripted Western Two Mules for Sister Sara, the American Civil War melodrama The Beguiled, and the prison-break picture Escape from Alcatraz. He was a considerable influence on Eastwood's own career as a director, and Eastwood's film Unforgiven is dedicated \"for Don and Sergio\". Siegel had a long collaboration with composer Lalo Schifrin, who scored five of his films: Coogan's Bluff, The Beguiled, Dirty Harry, Charley Varrick, and Telefon. Schifrin composed and recorded what would have been his sixth score for Siegel on Jinxed! (1982), but it was rejected by the studio despite Siegel's objections. This conflict was one of several fights Siegel had on his last film. Siegel was also important to the career of director Sam Peckinpah. In 1954, Peckinpah was hired as a dialogue coach for Riot in Cell Block 11. His job entailed acting as an assistant to the director, Siegel. The film was shot on location at Folsom Prison. Siegel's location work and his use of actual prisoners as extras in the film made a lasting impression on Peckinpah. He worked as a dialogue coach on four additional Siegel films: Private Hell 36 (1954), An Annapolis Story (1955), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), and Crime in the Streets (1956). Twenty-five years later, Peckinpah was all but banished from the industry due to his troubled film productions. Siegel gave the director a chance to return to filmmaking. He asked Peckinpah if he would be interested in directing 12 days of second unit on Siegel's Jinxed! film. Peckinpah immediately accepted, and his earnest collaboration with his longtime friend was noted within the industry. While Peckinpah's work was uncredited, it led to his hiring as the director of his final film The Osterman Weekend (1983).    Cameos  Siegel had a small role as a bartender in Eastwood's Play Misty for Me, and in Dirty Harry. In Philip Kaufman's 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a remake of Siegel's 1956 film, he appears as a taxi driver. Private Hell 36 is a 1954 crime film noir directed by Don Siegel starring Ida Lupino, Steve Cochran, Howard Duff, Dean Jagger and Dorothy Malone. The picture was one of the last feature-length efforts by Filmakers, a company created by producer Collier Young and his star and then-wife Ida Lupino. == Plot ==\nL.A. police detectives Cal Bruner and Jack Farnham are partners. Upon meeting a nightclub singer, Lilli Marlowe, who may hold the key to solving a major New York robbery. Lilli assists the pair in the search for a suspect she encountered; a romance develops between her and Cal. When the suspect is finally spotted, a chase ensues which results in the death of the fugitive. Inside the car, there is a box filled with money and Cal pockets $80,000 of it. Jack wants nothing to do with this and reminds his partner that the money is marked. Cal has a plan, however, and Jack finds himself wedged into it. He reluctantly accepts a key to a trailer in which Cal has hidden the money, the idea being that Jack can access his share, but Jack - a family man who just wants as normal a life as possible - is increasingly agitated and racked with guilt.  Cal receives a call from the dead man's partner threatening to reveal the cop's deceit unless he gets his money back. Jack insists that they turn in the money and take what is coming to them, but Cal says he intends to murder the blackmailer and claim self defence.  After a time, Cal agrees to return the money, but he is actually preparing to kill his own partner.  When the crook suddenly shows up Cal wounds Jack, then Cal is killed by a shot from the dark.  Their boss, Captain Michaels, appears and reveals that he suspected the detectives had taken the money, the blackmailing crook was just a ruse.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nIda Lupino as Lilli Marlowe\nSteve Cochran as Cal Bruner\nHoward Duff as Jack Farnham\nDean Jagger as Capt. Michaels\nDorothy Malone as Francey Farnham\nKing Donovan as \tEvney Serovitch\nDabbs Greer as Sam Marvin\nWilliam Boyett as \tStimson\nTom Monroe as Patrolman Tom\nRichard Deacon as Mr. Mace\nJames Anderson as Patrolman in Locker Room\nBridget Duff as Bridget Farnham\nKenneth Patterson as Detective Lt. Lubin\nChester Conklin as \tMurdered Man\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe extensive racetrack scenes in the film were shot at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California. The interiors of real bars and shops were used so the actors could walk out into actual streets within the same scene.\nThe film starts with a pre-credit sequence before the first titles appear in an early modernist foreshadowing of the action teaser before it became commonplace on television series of the sixties. Typical of The Film[m]akers productions the last title card misspells “Made in Holl[y]wood, USA.“\nThe film is notable as one of the early Siegel B movies on which future auteur Sam Peckinpah (credited under his first name of David) learned his craft as a dialogue director.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFilm critic Bosley Crowther wrote a tepid review, \"A critic might note that attention is sharply divided between the main theme and the incidental character that Miss Lupino plays. This is somewhat understandable, since Miss Lupino happens to be one of the partners in Filmakers and a coauthor of the script. But let's not worry about it. No deplorable damage is done. There's not very much here to damage. Just an average melodrama about cops.\"\n\n\n== Theme ==\nPrivate Hell 36 showcases a number of Siegel’s thematic concerns, among the crisis that occurs when “original assumptions [or] convictions are turned against a protagonist” Film critic Judith M. Kass writes:\n\n Siegel demonstrates that love is not a refuge for man or woman, even for the couple (Howard Duff and Dorothy Malone) whose marriage is threatened by Duff’s anxiety and subsequent drinking. For Siegel, love apparently complicates rather than ameliorates the existential loneliness of his characters, creating for them additional hurdles in their already turbulent emotional lives and forming, rather than eroding, barriers to feeling and closeness.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nKass, Judith M.

She is a film director, and an Israeli culture entrepreneur. William Arnold Ridley, OBE (7 January 1896 – 12 March 1984) was an English playwright and actor, earlier in his career known for writing the play The Ghost Train and later in life in the British television sitcom Dad's Army (1968–1977) as the elderly bumbling Private Godfrey, as well as in spin-offs including the feature film version and the stage production.    Early life  William Arnold Ridley was born in Walcot, Bath, Somerset, England, the son of Rosa Caroline (née Morrish, 1870–1956) and William Robert Ridley (1871–1931). His father was a gymnastics instructor and ran a boot and shoe shop. He attended the Clarendon School and the Bath City Secondary School where he was a keen sportsman. A graduate of the University of Bristol, he studied at the Education Department, and played Hamlet in a student production. Ridley undertook teaching practice at an Elementary School in Bristol.    Military service  Ridley was a student teacher and had made his theatrical debut in Prunella at the Theatre Royal, Bristol when he volunteered for service with the British Army on the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. He was initially rejected because of a hammer toe. In December 1915, he enlisted as a private with the Somerset Light Infantry, British Army. He saw active service in the war, sustaining several wounds in close-quarter battle. His left hand was left virtually useless by wounds sustained on the Somme; his legs were riddled with shrapnel; he received a bayonet wound in the groin; and the legacy of a blow to the head from a German soldier's rifle butt left him prone to blackouts after the war. He was medically discharged from the army with the rank of lance corporal in May 1917. He received the Silver War Badge having been honourably discharged from the army due to wounds received in the war, and was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal for his service. Ridley rejoined the army in 1939 following the outbreak of the Second World War. He was commissioned into the General List on 7 October 1939 as a second lieutenant. He served with the British Expeditionary Force in France during the \"Phoney War\", employed as a \"Conducting Officer\" tasked with supervising journalists who were visiting the front line. In May 1940, Ridley returned to Britain on the overcrowded destroyer HMS Vimiera, which was the last British ship to escape from the harbour during the Battle of Boulogne. Shortly afterwards, he was discharged from the Armed Forces on health grounds. He relinquished his commission as a captain on 1 June 1940. He subsequently joined the Home Guard, in his home town of Caterham, and ENSA, with which he toured the country. He described his wartime experiences on Desert Island Discs in 1973.    Acting career  After his medical discharge from the army in 1916, Ridley commenced a career as a professional actor. In 1918 he joined the company of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, staying for two years and playing 40 parts before moving on to Plymouth, where he took a break from the stage when his war injuries began to trouble him. After being stranded for an evening at Mangotsfield railway station, near Bristol, Ridley was inspired to write the play The Ghost Train (1923), a tale of passengers stranded at a haunted railway station in Cornwall, with one of the characters being an incognito British Government agent trying to catch Bolshevik revolutionaries active in Great Britain. The play was produced on stage, and became a hit, with 665 performances being staged consecutively in London's West End, and two revivals. The first credited filmed version was a German-British silent film co-production The Ghost Train in 1927. The Ghost Train was also filmed in 1931 and again in 1941 when it starred Arthur Askey. Ridley also wrote more than 30 other plays including The Wrecker (1924), Keepers of Youth (1929), The Flying Fool (1929) and Recipe for Murder (1932). During his time in military service in the Second World War he adapted the Agatha Christie novel Peril at End House into a West End play that premiered in 1940. Ridley's post-war play, Beggar My Neighbour, was first performed in 1951 and adapted for the Ealing Comedy film Meet Mr. Lucifer (1953). Ridley worked regularly as an actor, including an appearance in the British comedy Crooks in Cloisters (1964). He also played Doughy Hood, the village baker, in the radio soap opera The Archers and the Rev. Guy Atkins in the ATV soap Crossroads from the programme's inception in 1964 until 1968.

With a total of 16 years in office, he is the longest serving Prime Minister in Norway since the introduction of parliamentarism. He was the leader of the Labour Party from 1945 to 1965. Many Norwegians often refer to him as \"Landsfaderen\" (Father of the Nation); he is generally considered one of the main architects of the post-war rebuilding of Norway after World War II. He also served as the second President of the Nordic Council in 1954.    Biography     Early life  Einar Gerhardsen was born in the municipality of Asker, in the county of Akershus. His parents were Gerhard Olsen (1867–1949) and Emma Hansen (1872–1949). His father was rodemester' roadworker ' in Public Roads Administration and was foreman of a trade union committee, fanekomiteen for Veivesenets arbeiderforening, and during Gerhardsen's childhood the trade union's leader Carl Jørgensen frequently visited their home, and sometimes they would sing The Internationale and Seieren følger våre faner (\"victory follows our banners\"). In 1932, he married Werna Julie Koren Christie (1912–1970), daughter of agent Johan Werner Koren Christie and Klara Rønning. The couple had two sons, Truls and Rune and a daughter Torgunn. His brother was Rolf Gerhardsen and the pair also had a lifelong working relationship. From the age of seventeen, Gerhardsen attended meetings with the Labour Party's youth movement. In 1918, during the Finnish Civil War, Gerhardsen resigned his membership of the Church of Norway after the church sided with the \"Whites\" against the \"Reds\".    Political work, imprisonment  Originally a road worker, Gerhardsen became politically active in the socialist labour movement during the 1920s. He was convicted several times of taking part in subversive activities until he, along with the rest of the Labour Party, gradually moved from communism to democratic socialism. He participated in the Left Communist Youth League's military strike action of 1924. He was convicted for assisting in this crime and sentenced to 75 days in prison. By the mid-1930s, Labour was a major force on the national political scene, becoming the party of government under Prime Minister Johan Nygaardsvold from 1935 until the Nazi invasion in 1940. Gerhardsen was elected to Oslo city council in 1932 and became deputy mayor in 1938. He was deputy leader of the Labour Party from 1939. After the German occupation of Norway in 1940, Gerhardsen became acting Chairman of the Labour Party, as the chairman, Oscar Torp had gone into exile. Gerhardsen became Mayor of Oslo on 15 August 1940, but was forced to resign by the Germans on 26 August the same year. In September, the Nazi occupation government banned all parliamentary political parties, including the Labour Party. During World War II, Gerhardsen took part in the organised resistance against the German occupation of Norway, and was arrested on 11 September 1941. Having already been under suspicion for a long time, Gerhardsen had been detained and subjected to interrogations on 31 previous occasions since the summer of 1940. Initially he was sent to Grini concentration camp in Norway. In February 1942, he was accused of leading resistance work from his imprisonment, and removed from the camp for interrogation. Initially interrogated at the police station at Møllergata 19, he was soon transferred to the Gestapo headquarters at Victoria Terrasse. At Victoria Terrasse, he was tortured to reveal information on the resistance, but did not give in. In April 1942, he was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany. In September 1944, he was transferred back to Grini, where he spent the rest of the war. After the war, Gerhardsen formed the interim government which sat from the end of the occupation in May 1945 until the general election held in October the same year. The election gave Labour an absolute majority in Parliament, the Storting, which it retained until 1961. Gerhardsen served as President of the Storting from 10 January 1954 to 22 January 1955.    Domestic and foreign policy from 1945   During and after his periods in office, he was greatly respected by the people; even those not sharing his social democratic views.

        "answer": "no",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Does Mukasa Mbidde have the same nationality as Erich Maas?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nErich Mendelsohn (German pronunciation: [ˈeːʁɪç ˈmɛndl̩ˌzoːn] ); 21 March 1887 – 15 September 1953) was a German-British architect, known for his expressionist architecture in the 1920s, as well as for developing a dynamic functionalism in his projects for department stores and cinemas. Mendelsohn was a pioneer of the Art Deco and Streamline Moderne architecture, notably with his 1921 Mossehaus design.    Biography  Mendelsohn was born to a Jewish family in Allenstein, East Prussia, Germany, now the Polish town of Olsztyn. His birthplace was at the former Oberstrasse 21, now no. 10 Staromiejska street. A plaque embedded on the wall on the side of Barbara street commemorates his place of birth. He was not related to the Mendelssohn family. He was the fifth of six children; his mother was Emma Esther (née Jaruslawsky), a hatmaker and his father David was a shopkeeper. He attended a humanist Gymnasium in Allenstein and continued with commercial training in Berlin.  In 1906, he took up the study of national economics at the University of Munich. In 1908, he began studying architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin); two years later he transferred to the Technische Hochschule München, where in 1912 he graduated cum laude. In Munich he was influenced by Theodor Fischer, an architect whose own work fell between neo-classical and Jugendstil, and who had been teaching there since 1907; Mendelsohn also made contact with members of Der Blaue Reiter and Die Brücke, two groups of expressionist artists. From 1912 to 1914, he worked as an independent architect in Munich. In 1915, he married the cellist Luise Maas. Between 1910 and 1953, they corresponded with each other; these materials provide insight into the lives of an artist and couple who experienced a changing international landscape, including their fleeing from the Third Reich in Germany in 1933. Through his wife, he met the cello-playing astrophysicist Erwin Finlay Freundlich. Freundlich was the brother of Herbert Freundlich, the deputy director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut für Physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie (now the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society in the Dahlem district of Berlin). Freundlich wished to build a suitable astronomical observatory to experimentally confirm Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  Through his relationship with Freundlich, Mendelsohn had the opportunity to design and build the Einsteinturm (\"Einstein Tower\"). This relationship and also the family friendship with the Luckenwalde hat manufacturers Salomon and Gustav Herrmann helped Mendelsohn to an early success. From then until 1918, what is known of Mendelsohn is, above all, a multiplicity of sketches of factories and other large buildings, often in small format or in letters from the front to his wife, Louise Mendelsohn (née Maas; 1895–1980). The 2011 documentary film by Duki Dror titled \"Incessant Visions\" is about Erich Mendelsohn and his wife, in which Dror animates the memoirs of Louise and the letters.    Architecture career  At the end of 1918, on his return from World War I, he settled his practice in Berlin. The Einsteinturm and the hat factory in Luckenwalde established his reputation. The Hat Factory was commissioned in 1921, Mendelsohn's design included four production halls, a boiler, a turbine house, two gatehouses and a dyeing hall. The dyeing hall became a distinctive feature of the factory, the building was shaped with a modern ventilation hood that expelled the toxic fumes used in the dyeing process. The structure even ironically resembled a hat. As early as 1924, Wasmuths Monatshefte für Baukunst (a series of monthly magazines on architecture) produced a booklet about his work. In that same year, along with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius, he was one of the founders of the progressive architectural group known as Der Ring. His practice employed as many as forty people, among them, as a trainee, Julius Posener, later an architectural historian. Mendelsohn's work encapsulated the consumerism of the Weimar Republic, most particularly in his shops: most famously the Schocken Department Stores. Erich Šlomović( also known as Erich Chlomovitch)( 1915–1942) was a Yugoslav art collector. He was an assistant and protégé of Ambroise Vollard. Erich Maas( born 24 December 1940 in Prüm, Rhine Province) is a German former footballer. He spent eight seasons in the Bundesliga, as well as five seasons in the French Division 1, and was capped three times for the German national team. == Honours ==\nEintracht Braunschweig\n\nBundesliga: 1966–67\nNantes\n\nFrench Division 1: 1972–73\nCoupe de France runner-up: 1972–73 Alexandros( Alex, Alexander) Margaritis;( born 20 September 1984) is a racing driver who is best known for competing in the German- based Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters touring car championship.

Braunschweiger Turn- und Sportverein Eintracht von 1895 e.V., commonly known as Eintracht Braunschweig (German pronunciation: [ˈaɪntʁaxt ˈbʁaʊnʃvaɪk]) or BTSV (IPA: [ˌbeː teː ʔɛs ˈfaʊ]), is a German football and sports club based in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony. The club plays in the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier of the German football league system.    History     Foundation and early years  Eintracht Braunschweig was founded as the football and cricket club FuCC Eintracht 1895 in 1895, became FC Eintracht von 1895 in 1906, then SV Eintracht in 1920. The team has a colourful history and it quickly became one of northern Germany's favourite sides. In 1900, Eintracht Braunschweig was among the founding members of the German Football Association (DFB). It enjoyed success early on, playing in the upper-tier league, winning the Northern German championship in 1908 and 1913, and placing three players on the Germany national team by 1914. Under the Third Reich, the team played in the Gauliga Niedersachsen and managed two appearances in the national final rounds. In 1942–43, Eintracht Braunschweig went into the national championship play-offs as one of the main favourites. The team under manager Georg \"Schorsch\" Knöpfle had just won the newly formed Gauliga Südhannover-Braunschweig with a record of 17 wins and 1 draw in 18 games, scoring 146 goals in the process. After a convincing 5–1 win over Victoria Hamburg in the first round, the draw saw the club paired with the other big favourites for the title, Helmut Schön's Dresdner SC. Dresden won the game held in Dresden with 4–0, and subsequently won the German championship, with an undefeated season.    Post-war football   As part of the denazification of Germany after World War II, the British authorities dissolved all previously existing sports clubs in Braunschweig and demanded the creation of a single, united sports club for the city. As such, Eintracht Braunschweig was merged into the new club TSV Braunschweig on 2 November 1945. TSV Braunschweig finally took on the club's current name, Braunschweiger TSV Eintracht von 1895, on 1 April 1949. The club continued to play in the top division – now the Oberliga Nord – after the war, with the exception of a single season (1952–53) spent in tier II. The side was touched by tragedy in 1949 when goalkeeper Gustav Fähland died of internal bleeding a few days after being injured during a game in a collision with a Werder Bremen striker. Another appearance in the final round of the national championship came in 1958.    Bundesliga football 1963 to 1985   Eintracht Braunschweig's consistently high standard of play and financial stability helped it to become one of the 16 teams selected out of a group of 46 applicants for play in the Bundesliga, the new federal professional league formed in 1963. Once again the side enjoyed early success, winning the national title in the 1966–67 season under manager Helmuth Johannsen with solid defensive play. That championship team gave up only 27 goals against, which stood as a Bundesliga record until bettered by Werder Bremen in 1988. Another ten players joined the national side from the team, mostly through the 1960s and 1970s. The club was hit by tragedy again during the winter break of the 1968–69 season when forward Jürgen Moll, aged 29 at the time, and his wife died in a car accident. Two charity matches were played for the benefit of the Molls' children, the first featured West Germany's 1954 FIFA World Cup-winning squad in the line-up of the tournament's final, and the second saw a combined squad of Eintracht Braunschweig and rivals Hannover 96 take on a Bundesliga all-star team. The club found itself embroiled in the Bundesliga scandal of 1971, but with a somewhat unusual twist. A number of players accepted payments totalling 40,000 DM – not to underperform and so lose or tie a game, but rather to put out an extra effort to win. Masaka is a district and a city in the Buganda Region in southern Uganda, west of Lake Victoria. The city is the headquarters of Masaka District.    Location  Masaka is approximately 132 kilometres (82 mi) to the south-west of Kampala on the highway to Mbarara. The city is close to the Equator. The coordinates of Masaka are 0°20'28.0\"S, 31°44'10.0\"E (Latitude:-0.341111; Longitude:31.736111). Masaka lies at an average elevation of 1,288 metres (4,226 ft) above sea level.    History  Masaka was founded as a township in 1953. It became a town council in 1958 and a municipality in 1968. Masaka was a strategically important location during the Uganda–Tanzania War (1978–79), and was accordingly garrisoned by Uganda Army troops. These soldiers terrorized the local civilians, prompting most to flee the town. On 23–24 February 1979, the Tanzania People's Defence Force and allied Ugandan rebels attacked the settlement, resulting in the Battle of Masaka. The town was bombarded with artillery, and fell to the Tanzanian-led forces after light resistance. The Tanzanians subsequently levelled much of the town to take revenge for atrocities committed by the Uganda Army during its previous invasion of northwestern Tanzania. In course of the Ugandan Bush War, Masaka again suffered from fighting. The town was garrisoned by the Uganda National Liberation Army which served as Uganda's national army at the time. In late 1985, National Resistance Army rebels laid siege to the town. After heavy combat, Masaka's garrison surrendered on 10 December 1985. In 2019 the Cabinet of Uganda, resolved to award Masaka, city status effective July 2023. In November of the same year, Cabinet revised the date of city status to 1 July 2020.

Football Club de Nantes (Breton: Naoned; Gallo: Naunnt), commonly referred to as FC Nantes or simply Nantes (IPA: [nɑ̃t] ), is a French professional football club based in Nantes in Pays de la Loire. The club was founded on 21 April 1943, during World War II, as a result of local clubs based in the city coming together to form one large club. From 1992 to 2007, the club was referred to as FC Nantes Atlantique before reverting to its current name at the start of the 2007–08 season. Nantes play in Ligue 1, the first division of Football in France. Nantes is one of the most successful clubs in French football, having won eight Ligue 1 titles, four Coupe de France wins and attained one Coupe de la Ligue victory. The club is famous for its jeu à la nantaise (lit. 'Nantes-style play'), its collective spirit, mainly advocated under coaches José Arribas, Jean-Claude Suaudeau and Raynald Denoueix and for its youth system, which has produced players such as Marcel Desailly, Didier Deschamps, Mickaël Landreau, Claude Makélélé, Christian Karembeu and Jérémy Toulalan. As well as Les Canaris ('The Canaries'), Nantes is also nicknamed Les jaunes et verts ('The Green and Yellows') and La Maison Jaune ('The Yellow House').    History     Foundation  The club was founded in 1943. The first match played by Nantes as a professional team took place at the Stade Olympique de Colombes against CA Paris, where Nantes triumphed 2–0. The first home match was a defeat of the same score against Troyes. The club finished fifth at the end of this first season following which the club's manager Aimé Nuic left the club following a dispute, and was succeeded by Antoine Raab, who took over in a player-coach role. After winning 16 consecutive matches, Nantes lost 9–0 to Sochaux. The club became a professional football club in 1945 after winning the Western Region championship, and started that season in the second division. Under historic president Marcel Saupin, it spent a few years as a mid-table club in that division, with even threat of relegation in 1950, avoided on the last game only.    The 1950s  Results improved from 1951 onwards, and the club just missed out on promotion in 1952, finishing 4th, under respected coach Emile Veinante. His successor Antoine Raab was able to recruit more prestigious players, including Dutch stars Gerrit Vreken and Jan van Geen, but despite this, the club stagnated again. A number of coaches followed, but the club did not progress, and promising early starts to seasons often petered out by their ends. In 1960, president Marcel Saupin selected the young and promising amateur coach José Arribas. He was credited with revolutionising the team's game, insisting on team-based, less individual play, and an attack-oriented game. He set up a 4-2-4 instead of the then traditional 4 banks of players. His system showed promise but results were not forthcoming right away: placings read 11th, 6th in his first 2 seasons, and finally 2nd in 1962, having led the second division for the first half of the season. In that time, the club took part in the short-lived Anglo-French-Scottish cup, losing 71 to Liverpool FC.    Life in the top division - the José Arribas years (1963 to 1976)  José Arribas and Nantes found their place in the top division right away and finished 8th in their first season. The following season was even better: the club becomes French champions, and their star striker Jacky Simon was the league's top goalscorer and became the first Nantes player to earn an international cap. The club also won the French League Cup. In 1965, the club confirmed its place at the top and won the league again. Best defence (36 goals conceded), best attack (84 goals scored), Philippe Gondet ended the season as the league's top goalscorer with 36 goals in 37 games. French success did not lead to European success however, and Nantes lost their first-round European Cup game to Partizan Belgrade, who went on to reach the final. Arthur Schütz( also known as Erich Ritter von Winkler)( 25 January 1880, Moscow – 9 February 1960, Vienna) was an Austrian engineer and writer, most notable for creating a special kind of hoax called\" Grubenhund\". The East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) is a sub-organ of the larger East African Community, being the legislative arm of the Community. Members are sworn into five-year terms.    History  Since colonial times, a number of organizations have sought to integrate the region of East Africa. During the Victorian Era, rail links were established, and a number of regional organizations, such as the East African Currency Board and the East African Court of Appeal were established. A new wave of agreements and organizations were launched during the mid-20th century. The Treaty for East African Co-operation was signed in 1967, launching the East African Community. However, due to political differences and weak participation, the treaty was nullified in 1977, ending the East African Community. Despite this, interest in further regional cooperation continued. On 14 May 1984, the East African Community Mediation Agreement was signed, which pledged to \"explore and identify areas for future co-operation and to make arrangements for such co-operation\". On 26 November 1994, representatives from Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania signed the Agreement for the Establishment of a Permanent Tripartite Commission, which established a commission to further cooperation among the three countries.

Second Assembly (2007-2012)  On 1 July 2007, Burundi and Rwanda joined the East African Community, and, therefore, the East Africa Legislative Assembly. Abdirahim Abdi of Kenya served the Speaker of the Second Assembly.

Sabash Ramudu is a 1959 Indian Telugu-language drama film directed by C. S. Rao. It stars N. T. Rama Rao and Devika, with music composed by Ghantasala. The film was produced by Sundarlal Nahata and T. Aswathanarayana under the Rajshree Productions banner. The film is a remake of the Hindi film Bada Bhai (1957). It was dubbed in Tamil language with the title Sabash Ramu.    Plot  The film begins at Hyderabad, where Ramu, a wealthy landlord who lost everything in the floods of Godavari, arrives with his family. He buys a rickshaw for a livelihood and aims to civilize his sibling, Mohan. So, he strives hard, which his benevolent wife Lakshmi always favors. In college, Mohan falls for Police Commissioner Narayana Rao’s daughter Rani. Besides, dreadful gangsters under the command of vicious Bhupati create mayhem in the town. Bhupati pretends to be honorable and runs a Night Carnival club with his acolyte, Jayashree. Inspector Kumar, the supercilious son of Narayana Rao, is specially appointed to seize the gang. He goes into the snare of Jayashree & bribes and mingles in their wing.  Parallelly, Cutting Master, a piety thief, befriends Ramu and crushes with plucky Malli. Once, Bhupati gets into Ramu’s rickshaw when he discerns their shade and base. So, he becomes a victim of their bullets and fractures his leg. Anyhow, Narayana Rao secures him and admits to the hospital. Hereupon, Bhupathi covetously intrudes and threatens to make Ramu quiet, showing danger to his family, which he does. Due to his health condition, Ramu becomes incompetent, which makes it hard for them to survive. Ergo, Lakshmi works as a maid, and Mohan pulls the rickshaw, quitting his studies. Knowing it, Ramu collapses since he cannot raise the funds for Mohan’s examination. Though Cutting Master walks to help, he denies it is disgraceful stolen money.  Consequently, rickshaw races occur in which Ramu hits the big time at life risk and triumphs in graduating Mohan. Kumar rebukes Rani for her love affair because he opposes the destitute. However, Narayana Rao, who provides fair treatment to all, accepts the match and aids Mohan to mold into the Police Inspector. Mohan currently turns tough nut to Bhupati. Hence, he wiles to slay him by Jayashree, which she rejects when a rift arises between them. Jayashree pleads for Kumar’s support but cannot completely surrender to Bhupati. One night, for fun, Ramu steps out with the rickshaw Jayashree rides, whom he drops at home. Exploiting it, Bhupathi slaughters her and incriminates Ramu by planting her jewelry at his residence.  The next day, while Mohan & Rani’s engagement is in progress, Mohan is compelled to apprehend his brother. To this, Lakshmi slaps him, but Ramu feels proud of his honesty. Following this, Mohan detects the whereabouts of Bhupati’s camp by backing Cutting Master & Malli. Simultaneously, Rani chases Kumar under suspicion and lands therein, but Bhupati nabs all of them. Now, Bhupati ruses to knit Rani by threatening Mohan’s life. During that quandary, Narayana Rao allows Lakshmi to negotiate with Ramu, who flees from the jail, getting knowledge of the status quo. At last, Ramu ceases Bhupati and shields all when Kumar attempts to skip, but duty-minded Narayana Rao prisons him. Finally, the movie ends happily with the marriage of Mohan & Rani.

The police, led by Inspector Khan, arrive at the scene. In court, Rahul testifies against Karan and so does Alex after he exposes him of the bribe. Karan is arrested for the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment and the Judge rules that Saxena can no longer be Karan's lawyer.

Between 1945 and 1949 he studied German philology at the University of Leipzig, and took a course of direction and acting in 1947–1949 at the Leipzig Higher School of Music and Drama. In the early 1950s he worked as an actor and director at various theaters in East Germany.\nAfter 1955 he worked at DEFA, the East German film studio, in a wide range of genres: fairy tales (\"Ms. Blizzard,\" from the story of the same name by the Brothers Grimm), adventure films, musicals, and science fiction (\"Signals\" and \"B dust of stars\" on themes similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey).

It was first performed at the Théâtre de la Renaissance, Paris, on 30 October 1880. The composer died before the orchestration of the score was finished, and Léo Delibes completed it. The opera depicts the romantic affairs of a beautiful Parisian laundress, known as \"Belle Lurette\", and the entanglements of those around her.    Background  Offenbach's career had been severely disrupted by the downfall in 1870 of the Second Empire, with which he had been closely linked. By the end of the decade he had substantially restored his earlier status as a composer of popular comic operas. His last completed such work, La fille du tambour-major (1879), ran for more than 240 performances, at a time when a run of 100 performances was considered a success. In the early 1870s Offenbach had been temporarily eclipsed by a younger rival, Charles Lecocq, who was associated with the Théâtre de la Renaissance, but by the end of the decade Lecocq's works began to find less favour among the public, and in 1880 Offenbach was delighted to accept an invitation from Victor Koning, director of the Renaissance, to write a piece for the theatre. He withdrew from Paris to Saint-Germain-en-Laye to work on the new piece and on his ambitious opera The Tales of Hoffmann. He returned to Paris in September to supervise early rehearsals of the latter at the Opéra-Comique. His already precarious health took a turn for the worse and he died in his sleep on 5 October. Offenbach's friend and former protégé Léo Delibes undertook the remaining orchestration of the score. The work opened at the Renaissance on 30 November 1880 and ran for 82 performances, closing on 11 January 1881.    Original cast   A note in the published vocal score indicates that the rôle of the Duke of Marly may be played by a woman en travesti, as was done when the piece was first seen in Brussels, a few weeks after the Paris premiere.

Subash featuring R. Parthiepan, Divya Unni and Ranjith and was released on 1 September 2000. The film was remade in Hindi as\" Vaadaa\"( 2005). == Plot ==\nThe two people in focus are Srinivasan aka Seenu (R. Parthiepan) and his good friend Dharan Viswanath (Ranjith). Seenu is a loving husband of Shanti (Divya Unni). Seenu is blind, having lost his eyesight in an accident in the past. The movie begins with Srinivasan and Dharan discovering that Shanti has hanged herself in the house. \nWith no strong suspects, the police close the case as a suicide. But soon, several evidences surface which point to the possibility that Dharan is behind Shanti's death, including Dharan's shoe at the site of Shanti's cremation. He resolutely maintains that he is innocent, while Seenu too believes him initially. However, as the story progresses, Seenu seems convinced that his wife has been murdered, and starts to suspect Dharan. Meanwhile, Dharan starts to suspect that Seenu isn't really blind. Dharan wants to frame Seenu for Shanti's death, and, along with his friend Advocate Mohan (Mohan Raman), sets up traps to prove that Seenu is not blind.  \nA series of flashbacks show that Seenu and Shanti were happily married, but Dharan was also in love with Shanti. Seenu did have proper eyesight, but a car accident rendered him blind. Dharan took advantage of the fact and started troubling Shanti more, while she tried to stay loyal to her husband.   \nSeenu underwent a surgery without informing Shanti or Dharan to restore his eyesight, and came back home to surprise his wife, but he noticed Dharan being physically intimate with Shanti. So Seenu decided to pretend to be blind.   \nEventually, Seenu admits to Dharan that he was pretending to be blind only to trap him and hold Dharan responsible for Shanti's suicide. Seenu convinces the court and the police inspector (Thalaisaval Vijay) that Dharan is guilty and Dharan is arrested. But Dharan insists the court to test Seenu's eyesight to prove his point that Seenu is not blind.   \nWith no choice left, Seenu deliberately blinds himself again by staring at a bright light from a welding torch, and is hence proved innocent. Seenu meets Dharan in jail, where Dharan secretly has a voice recorder. Seenu seemingly admits that he got Dharan arrested, and Dharan claims to have recorded the full conversation. But Seenu reveals that the recorded has no battery in it, so Dharan cannot prove anything. The movie ends with Seenu leaving the jail to start a new life, while Dharan angrily yells at Seenu but to no avail.   \n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was originally titled as Paakkanum Pola Irukku.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack was composed by Deva.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSavitha Padmanabhan of The Hindu wrote, \"The story [..] has several plot twists, some of which are predictable. But in a film that is supposed to be a murder mystery, the badly choreographed song sequences seem to be rude interruptions. Ideally, the film would have worked better if the songs had been cut out and the editing had been tighter.\" Visual Dasan of Kalki praised Ranjith's acting who overtook other actors and added Deva impresses in background score but messes up in songs and concluded saying it can be watched for one to one manship of Ranjith and Parthiban otherwise, one have to think about how to congratulate (sabash) Subhash after yawning. K. N. Vijiyan of New Straits Times wrote, \"At the end of the movie, you may be moved to say \"Syabas (well done) to director Subash.

Priscilla Ann Presley (née Wagner,  formerly Beaulieu; born May 24, 1945) is an American businesswoman and actress. She is the ex-wife of American singer Elvis Presley, as well as the cofounder and former chairperson of Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE), the company that turned Graceland into one of the top tourist attractions in the United States. In her acting career, Presley costarred with Leslie Nielsen in the Naked Gun film trilogy and played Jenna Wade on the long-running television series Dallas.    Early life  Priscilla Ann Wagner was born at Brooklyn Naval Hospital in Brooklyn, New York on May 24, 1945. Her maternal grandfather, Albert Henry Iversen, was born in Egersund, Norway. He migrated to the United States, where he married Lorraine Davis, who was of Scots-Irish and English descent. Their only daughter was Anna Lillian Iversen, whose name was later shortened to Ann. Presley's biological father was US Navy pilot James Frederick Wagner, son of Kathryn and Harold Wagner of Cherrytree Township, Pennsylvania. He married Ann on August 10, 1944, after dating for more than three years. Wagner died in a plane crash on November 3, 1945. In 1948, Ann married United States Air Force officer Paul Beaulieu, from Québec, Canada. The couple raised Priscilla, along with half-siblings Donald, Michelle, Jeffrey and twins Thomas and Timothy Beaulieu. Priscilla's surname was legally changed from Wagner to Beaulieu on April 17, 1950. Over the next few years, the growing family repeatedly relocated as her stepfather's Air Force career moved them from Connecticut to New Mexico to Maine. Priscilla describes herself during this period as \"a shy, pretty, little girl, unhappily accustomed to moving from base to base every two or three years\". Presley would later recall how uneasy she felt about having to move so often, never knowing if she could ever make friends for life or if she would fit in with the people she would meet at the next place. In 1956, the family settled in Del Valle, Texas, but soon Beaulieu was transferred to Wiesbaden, West Germany. Priscilla was \"crushed\" upon learning this news, as it occurred just after her junior high school years, and was upset about leaving her friends and connections behind.    Life in West Germany  When the Beaulieus arrived in West Germany, they stayed at the Helene Hotel, but living at the hotel soon became too large a financial burden to sustain. After three months living at the hotel, the Beaulieus sought another home to rent. The family settled into a large apartment in a \"vintage building constructed long before World War I.\"  Soon after moving in, the Beaulieus realized the building operated as a brothel, but given the scarcity of housing, they had little choice but to remain.     Life with Elvis     Germany  On September 13, 1959, 14-year-old Priscilla met 24-year-old Elvis Presley at a party at his home in Bad Nauheim, Germany, which he had rented during his military service. Her presence is said to have made Elvis seem \"awkward\" and \"embarrassed\"; however, he composed himself by the end of the evening. Priscilla's late return home on the night of that first meeting upset her parents, who insisted that she never see Elvis again. However, his eagerness for another rendezvous and his promise to never bring her home late again led Priscilla's parents to relent. Thereafter, Priscilla and Elvis were frequently together until his departure from West Germany in March 1960. After Elvis left, Priscilla was inundated with requests for interviews from media outlets around the world. Priscilla received fan mail from Elvis fans, some positive and some negative, as well as mail from \"lonesome G.I.s.\". With gossip-magazine rumors swirling about Presley's relationship with Nancy Sinatra, Priscilla became convinced that her romance with Elvis was over, and she was concerned she would never see him again.    Move to Graceland   After Elvis's return to the US, Priscilla managed to stay in touch with him by phone, though they did not see each other again until the summer of 1962, when Priscilla's parents agreed to let her visit for two weeks. They allowed her to go, on the condition Elvis pay for a first-class round trip ticket and arrange for her to be chaperoned at all times.  She was also expected to write to her parents every day. Elvis agreed to all these demands, and Priscilla flew to Los Angeles. Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), also known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in \"Love Me Tender\". Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special \"Elvis\", which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, \"Aloha from Hawaii\". Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, blues, and gospel. He won three competitive Grammys, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame.

Known as the \"King of Rock and Roll\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great success and initial controversy.

With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of white American youth. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley's most famous films included Jailhouse Rock (1957), Blue Hawaii (1961), and Viva Las Vegas (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. However, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales estimated around 500 million records worldwide. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. He won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He holds several records, including the most RIAA-certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the Billboard 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.    Life and career     1935–1953: early years   Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Vernon and Gladys Love (née Smith) Presley. Elvis' twin Jesse Garon was delivered 35 minutes before, stillborn. Presley became close to both parents, especially his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, and the family often relied on neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check and was jailed for eight months. In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as \"average\". His first public performance was a singing contest at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, when he was 10; he sang \"Old Shep\" and recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he received guitar lessons from two uncles and a pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, \"I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. So Much (for) Stardust is the eighth studio album by American rock band Fall Out Boy and is their first album in over 5 years, thus marking the longest gap between studio albums. The album was released on March 24, 2023, on Fueled by Ramen, Elektra Records and DCD2. The album reunites the band with producer Neal Avron, who last produced Folie à Deux (2008), and also marks the band's return to their original record label Fueled By Ramen, which last released Take This to Your Grave (2003). The lead single from the album, \"Love from the Other Side\", was released on January 18, 2023, alongside the official announcement of the album. The second single, \"Heartbreak Feels So Good\", was released on January 25, 2023. The album saw a return to a more guitar-oriented pop rock and pop-punk sound, comparable to their 2008 album Folie à Deux, with disco, soul, funk, spoken word, and orchestral elements. The album received positive reviews from critics.    Background  After receiving mixed reviews for their 2018 album, Mania, the band went silent on new music, besides releasing a second greatest hits album in 2019. Vocalist Patrick Stump discussed the album's creation:  \"Technology has made it really easy to make records much more quickly these days. There's nothing wrong with that, and that spontaneity can be exciting... But we wanted to get back to the way we used to work. We wanted to make a record that was really lovingly crafted and deliberate and patiently guided – like someone cooked you a delicate meal. I'm not a very proud guy, but I'm pretty proud of this record.\" Due to the band's album deal with Island Records ending, the band signed with Fueled by Ramen and Elektra Records for the album's release, marking their first release under Fueled by Ramen since Take This to Your Grave. It was also announced that the album was produced by Neal Avron, making it the first time Fall Out Boy had worked with him since Folie à Deux. On the same day of the single release and album announcement, guitarist Joe Trohman announced on social media that he would be taking a break from the band to focus on his mental health. On March 3, 2023, the album's tracklist was confirmed.    Composition  According to Sarah Jamieson of DIY, \"[the album] sounds closer to a continuation of their 2008 record Folie à Deux than 2018's hyper-slick Mania, there's a return to the bold, luscious pop-rock that they honed early on.\" Writing for Clash, Shannon Garner felt that with this album, \"[the band pulled] themselves back into the pop-punk realm.\" The album also has disco, soul and funk influences. Mark Beaumont of The Independent the \"[album contains] grandiose orchestral passages, spoken word interludes and touches of Bruno Mars funk pop dotted among the roaring angst rock...[that blends] of their various eras...[and] pulls the plug on the rise of the machines.\" The album marks a return to a more guitar-driven sound. However, Stump maintains that \"it's not a throwback record\" but rather an imagining of \"what would it have sounded like if we had made a record right after Folie à Deux instead of taking a break for a few years. It was like exploring the multiverse. It was an experiment in seeing what we would have done.\"    Promotion     Singles  In December 2022, the band released a claymation animation homage, and began teasing a new song. The band made a website called sendingmylovefromtheotherside.com. On January 10, 2023, Oliver Sykes of Bring Me the Horizon posted to his Instagram story that he had received a package in the mail from Fall Out Boy containing a pink seashell labeled 1 of 13 alongside a letter with the date January 18, 2023, and the song title \"Love From The Other Side\". The lead single, \"Love from the Other Side\", was announced on January 11, 2023. The song was released on January 18, alongside the band confirming the album title and setting the release date for March 24, 2023. Since then, the band has posted a photo of another package with a set of coordinates leading to the Field of Dreams Movie Site in Dyersville, Iowa. The package contained another seashell marked 2 of 13 with a letter, this time printed was the date January 25, 2023, and a speculated song title \"Heartbreak Feels So Good\". \"The World Is Too Much with Us\" is a sonnet by the English Romantic poet William Wordsworth. In it, Wordsworth criticises the world of the First Industrial Revolution for being absorbed in materialism and distancing itself from nature. Composed circa 1802, the poem was first published in Poems, in Two Volumes (1807).\n\n\n== Theme ==\nIn the early nineteenth century, Wordsworth wrote several sonnets lambasting what he perceived as \"the decadent material cynicism of the time.\" \"The World Is Too Much with Us\" is one of those works. It reflects his view that humanity must get in touch with people to progress spiritually. The rhyme scheme of the poem is ABBA ABBA CDCD CD. This Italian or Petrarchan sonnet uses the last six lines (sestet) to answer the first eight lines (octave). The first eight lines (octave) are the problems and the next six (sestet) are the solutions.\nIn the sestet, the poet imagines believing in gods like Proteus and Triton rather than being Christian, despite seeing paganism as \"a creed outworn\", because he thinks that life would be more meaningful that way.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLeisure (poem) § Appraisal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKroeber, Karl (1963). \"A New Reading of 'The World Is Too Much with Us'\".

Elvis Presley (released in the UK as Elvis Presley Rock n' Roll) is the debut studio album by American rock and roll singer Elvis Presley. It was released by RCA Victor, on March 23, 1956, (catalog number LPM-1254). The recording sessions took place on January 10 and January 11 at the RCA Victor Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, and on January 30 and January 31 at the RCA Victor studios in New York. Additional material originated from sessions at Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, on July 5, August 19 and September 10, 1954, and on July 11, 1955. The album spent ten weeks at number one on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart in 1956, the first rock and roll album ever to make it to the top of the charts, and the first million-selling album of that genre. In 2003 and 2012, it was ranked number 56 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and at number 332 in a 2020 revised list. Elvis Presley was also one of three Presley albums to receive accolades in the reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. It was certified gold on November 1, 1966, and platinum on August 8, 2011, by the Recording Industry Association of America. The original 1956 UK release called Rock n' Roll on HMV Catalog Number: CLP 1093 has five different tracks.    Background  By the second half of 1955, singles on Sun Records by Presley began making the national country and western singles chart, \"Baby Let's Play House\" and \"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\" going to number 5 and number 1 respectively. Colonel Tom Parker, the new manager of Presley, had extensive dealings with RCA Victor through his previous client, singer Eddy Arnold, especially with the head of the Country and Western and Rhythm and blues division, Steve Sholes.  At the urging of Parker, on November 21, 1955, Sholes bought Presley's contract from Sam Phillips, the head of Sun Records and Studio, for the unprecedented sum of $40,000. Presley and rock and roll were still untested properties for the major labels in the music business, but this album, along with the number one single \"Heartbreak Hotel\", proved the selling power of both: it was the first RCA Victor pop album to earn more than $1,000,000, and in 1956 it had sold over one million units.    Content   Presley made appearances in four consecutive weeks on the Dorsey Brothers television program Stage Show in early 1956, on January 28, February 4, February 11, and February 18. RCA wanted an album in the stores fast to capitalize both on the nationwide TV exposure and the success of his first hit single on the pop charts with \"Heartbreak Hotel\", swiftly climbing to the top after its release on January 27. At the same time, there had only been two series of Presley recording sessions for RCA Victor by the end of the Dorsey stint, after which Presley and his band were back on the road. Those two sessions yielded an additional eleven tracks, almost enough to fill an entire LP, although some tracks had singles potential. In the 1950s, general practice dictated tracks having greater commercial potential to be released as singles, with tracks of lesser appeal placed on albums; as such, RCA Victor neither took all eleven tracks and simply made an album, nor placed the already released and briskly-selling \"Heartbreak Hotel\" on it. The rights to the Sun Studio tapes had transferred to RCA Victor with the sale of his contract, so five previously unreleased Sun songs, \"I Love You Because\", \"Just Because\", \"Tryin' to Get to You\", \"I'll Never Let You Go (Little Darlin')\", and \"Blue Moon\" were added to seven of the RCA Victor sessions tracks to bring the running time of the album up to an acceptable length. Phillips produced the sessions at Sun, and no producer was officially listed for the RCA Victor sessions, leading to the belief that Presley himself produced them. As the Sun tracks were mostly country-styled, Elvis and RCA Victor leavened the selections with covers of recent rhythm and blues songs. Two of these, \"Money Honey\" by Jesse Stone, known to Elvis from a version by Clyde McPhatter, and Ray Charles' 1955 hit \"I Got a Woman\", had been in Presley's live act for a year. A third was the frenetic announcement to the world of the existence of Little Richard in 1955, \"Tutti Frutti\". The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place. Lisa Marie Presley (February 1, 1968 – January 12, 2023) was an American singer-songwriter. She was the only child of singer and actor Elvis Presley and actress Priscilla Presley, as well as the sole heir to her father's estate after her grandfather and her great-grandmother died. Her musical career consisted of three studio albums: To Whom It May Concern (2003), Now What (2005) and Storm & Grace (2012), with To Whom It May Concern being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Presley also released non-album singles, including duets with her father using archival recordings. Her memoir, titled From Here to the Great Unknown, is scheduled to be released in October 2024.    Early life   Lisa Marie Presley was born on February 1, 1968, the only daughter of Elvis and Priscilla Presley at Baptist Memorial Hospital-Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee, nine months to the day after her parents' wedding. After her parents divorced, she lived with her mother in Los Angeles, and frequently stayed with her father at Graceland in Memphis. Presley's parents separated when she was four years old. When her father died in August 1977, nine-year-old Presley became joint heiress to his estate with her 61-year-old grandfather, Vernon Presley, and Vernon's 87-year-old mother Minnie Mae Presley (née Hood). Through Vernon, Lisa Marie was a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia. Upon the deaths of her grandfather in 1979 and her great-grandmother in 1980, she became Elvis' sole heir; on her 25th birthday in 1993, she inherited the estate, which had grown to an estimated $100 million. Presley sold 85 percent of her father's estate in 2004. In the late 1970s, a year or two after her father's death, she attended her first rock concert when she saw Queen at The Forum in Inglewood, California. She gave Freddie Mercury a scarf of her father's after the show, and expressed her love of theatrics. Shortly after her father's death, her mother began dating the actor Michael Edwards. In an interview with Playboy in 2003, Presley said Edwards would enter her room intoxicated and was sexually inappropriate with her. She has a half-brother, Navarone Garibaldi, from her mother's 22-year relationship with Marco Garibaldi. Presley made a video of \"Don't Cry Daddy\" as a posthumous duet with her father in 1997. This video was presented on August 16, 1997, at the tribute concert that marked the 20th anniversary of Elvis' death. The video contains Elvis' original vocal to which new instrumentation and Lisa Marie's vocals were added.    Career     2003–2005: To Whom It May Concern  Presley released her debut album, To Whom It May Concern, on April 8, 2003. It reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and was certified gold in June 2003. Presley wrote all the lyrics (except \"The Road Between\", which was co-written with Gus Black) and co-wrote every melody. To promote it, she presented a concert in the UK. The album's first single, \"Lights Out\", reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot Adult Top 40 chart and No. 16 on the UK charts. Presley collaborated with Billy Corgan for a co-written track called \"Savior\", which was included as the B-side. In his review of the album, the Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn wrote that it had a \"a stark, uncompromising tone\" and that \"Presley's gutsy blues-edged voice has a distinctive flair\". Pat Benatar and Presley performed at VH1 Divas Duets, a concert to benefit the VH1 Save the Music Foundation held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 22, 2003, in Las Vegas. Together they sang Benatar's hit \"Heartbreaker\", which Presley frequently performed at her own concerts on tours afterward. Also in 2003, Presley contributed a recording of \"Silent Night\" for the NBC Holiday Collection, Sounds of the Season.    2005–2012: Now What and further singles   Presley's second album, Now What, was released on April 5, 2005, and reached No. 9 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Presley co-wrote 10 songs and recorded covers of Don Henley's \"Dirty Laundry\" (the album's first single, which hit No. 36 on the Billboard 100 AC singles chart), and the Ramones' \"Here Today and Gone Tomorrow\". \" Where Was I?\" may refer to: \"Never was so much owed by so many to so few\" was a wartime speech delivered to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom by British prime minister Winston Churchill on 20 August 1940. The name stems from the specific line in the speech, \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\", referring to the ongoing efforts of the Royal Air Force and other Allied aircrew who were fighting in the Battle of Britain, the pivotal air battle with the German Luftwaffe. The speech came amidst German plans for an invasion. At the end of June 1940, the Luftwaffe had a large numerical superiority over the Royal Air Force, with around 2,550 planes compared to the only 750 planes of the RAF. Pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain have been known as \"the Few\" ever since, at times being specifically commemorated for Battle of Britain Day, on 15 September. The speech has become one of Churchill's most famous, along with \"we shall fight on the beaches\", \"their finest hour\", and \"blood, toil, tears, and sweat\".    Background  Churchill apparently first said the famous sentence to Major general Hastings Ismay after exiting the Battle of Britain Bunker at RAF Uxbridge on 16 August, four days before the speech was given. He had been visiting the No. 11 Group RAF operations room during the day of a battle, where at one point every squadron in the group was engaged while more waves of German planes were crossing the coast. After the fighting had slowed that evening and Churchill and Ismay had departed for Chequers, Churchill said, \"Don't speak to me; I have never been so moved.\" Several minutes later, he told Ismay, \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\" The speech was given as the United Kingdom prepared for an impending German invasion. Near the end of June 1940, codebreakers at Bletchley Park deciphered a message containing a request from a Flak Corps unit for detailed maps of the UK, suggesting that the Germans intended to land mobile anti-aircraft guns in Great Britain and Ireland. However, Hitler knew that any invasion attempt would only be successful if the Royal Air Force was weakened or destroyed.    Speech   Churchill's speech lasted nearly fifty minutes, in which he first remarked that, so far, there had been many fewer casualties than at the same point in the First World War, stating that the war was not a \"prodigious slaughter\", but instead a \"conflict of strategy, of organisation, of technical apparatus, of science, mechanics and morale\".  The British casualties in the first 12 months of the Great War amounted to 365,000. In this war, I am thankful to say, British killed, wounded, prisoners and missing, including civilians, do not exceed 92,000, and of these a large proportion are alive as prisoners of war. Looking more widely around, one may say that throughout all Europe, for one man killed or wounded in the first year perhaps five were killed or wounded in 1914–15. Churchill then spoke about Britain's military preparedness, noting that production of aircraft had increased significantly and would allow the United Kingdom to \"continue the air struggle indefinitely and as long as the enemy pleases\". He praised British fighter pilots and aircrews, using the phrase that he had first said several days before:  The gratitude of every home in our Island, in our Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the World War by their prowess and by their devotion. Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. While the speech is most well remembered for its praise of fighter pilots, it also commended bomber crews for their work and urged the public not to forget their actions.  All hearts go out to the fighter pilots, whose brilliant actions we see with our own eyes day after day; but we must never forget that all the time, night after night, month after month, our bomber squadrons travel far into Germany, find their targets in the darkness by the highest navigational skill, aim their attacks, often under the heaviest fire, often with serious loss, with deliberate careful discrimination, and inflict shattering blows upon the whole of the technical and war-making structure of the Nazi power. He commented on his government's decision to withdraw its forces from Somaliland the week before, explaining that the British position was untenable due to the French decision to surrender. Churchill also defended the blockade of Germany and its occupied territories, acknowledging that the blockade could cause suffering but laying the blame on the Nazis.

The editors-in-chief are Diane P. Bryant and Brian Bryant (University of Texas at Austin). The journal was established in 1978 and is published by SAGE Publications on behalf of the Hammill Institute on Disabilities. Allyson Michelle Felix  (born November 18, 1985) is a retired American track and field athlete who competed in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 400 meters. She specialized in the 200 meters from 2003 to 2013, then gradually shifted to the 400 meters later in her career. At 200 meters, Felix is the 2012 Olympic champion, a three-time world champion (2005–2009), a two-time Olympic silver medalist (2004 and 2008), and the 2011 world bronze medalist. At 400 meters, she is the 2015 world champion, 2011 world silver medalist, 2016 Olympic silver medalist, 2017 world bronze medalist, and 2020 Olympic bronze medalist. Across the short distances, Felix is a ten-time U.S. national champion (2004, 2005, 2007–2012, 2015 and 2016). Felix played a key role on the United States women's relay teams, winning six additional Olympic gold medals: four consecutive medals at 4 × 400 meters (2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020) and two at 4 × 100 meters (2012 and 2016). The 2012 and 2016 U.S. Olympic 4 × 100 m teams set a world record of 40.82 s and the second fastest time of 41.01 s, respectively. With these six golds from relays and one from an individual event, Felix became the first female track and field athlete to ever win seven Olympic gold medals. She is also the most decorated woman in Olympic track and field history and the most decorated American track and field athlete in Olympic history, having earned 11 total medals from five consecutive Olympic Games. Felix is the most decorated athlete, male or female, in World Athletics Championships history with 20 career medals, 7 from individual events and 13 from team relays. With a combined Olympic and World Championship total of 31 medals, she is also the overall most decorated athlete in track and field history, with 12 medals from individual events and 19 from relays. Felix was the first athlete in track and field history to medal in 3 different relays, 4 × 100 m, 4 × 400 m and mixed 4 × 400 m. Among Felix's notable performances, her 200 meters personal best of 21.69 seconds, which was set at the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials, ranked at the time as the third-fastest time ever run by an American woman and sixth-fastest time by a female athlete in history. She also ran a 47.72-second leg on the U.S. women's 4 × 400 m relay team at the 2015 Beijing World Championships, recording the fastest split ever by an American woman, and third-fastest split ever by a female athlete. Felix, along with Alysia Montaño and Kara Goucher, is credited with stirring public outcry over Nike's refusal to guarantee salary protections for its pregnant athletes, prompting the sportswear brand to expand its maternity policy in 2019. Two years after her departure from Nike, the athlete turned entrepreneur launched her own footwear company, Saysh, in June 2021. She was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2020 and 2021. In 2022, Felix received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from her alma mater USC and also served as the commencement speaker for that year's graduation ceremony. In July 2024, Felix was placed at number 63 on ESPN's list of the 100 greatest athletes of the 21st century.    Early life  Allyson Felix was born on November 18, 1985, in Los Angeles, California. She is the daughter of Paul, an ordained minister and professor of New Testament at The Master's Seminary in Sun Valley, California, and Marlean, an elementary school teacher at Balboa Magnet Elementary. Her elder brother Wes Felix was also a sprinter, winning the 2002 USA Junior Championships in the 200 meters race and later, the Pac-10 championships in 2003 and 2004 as a collegiate athlete for USC. Wes now acts as the agent for his sister. Felix describes her running ability as a gift from God: \"For me, my faith is the reason I run. I definitely feel I have this amazing gift that God has blessed me with, and it's all about using it to the best of my ability.\"    Junior career  Allyson Felix attended Los Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills, California, where she was nicknamed \"Chicken Legs\" by her teammates, because the five-foot-six, 125-pound sprinter's body had skinny legs despite her strength. Chelsea is a female given name of 20th-century coinage. It is pronounced ,  or , and sometimes spelled Chelsie or Chelsey. In the United States, the spelling \"Chelsea\" first entered the Social Security Administration baby naming data chart in 1969 at position 708. In Zimbabwe it is laden with positive meaning encompassing deep spirituality, beauty and strength. It rose in popularity among names for girls after 1980, peaking in 1992 at #15. As of 2009 it was ranked #231. This name is possibly linked with British pop culture of the late 1960s and Joni Mitchell's song \"Chelsea Morning\" (named after the Manhattan district). For example, Chelsea Clinton, daughter of former U.S. president Bill Clinton and former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is named after the song as performed by Judy Collins. Chelsea (alternatively Chelsey) was first a place name of Old English origin, and the most common theory of its meaning is chalk landing place,  Calc-hyð  \"chalk wharf\". The Synod of Chelsea at Chelchith in 787 is often identified with Chelsea, London; but the first firm record is of a manor at Chelsea just before the Norman conquest. Today this original Chelsea is part of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and is pronounced  CHEL-see. From this origin other usages and places have arisen. For example, Chelsea, Manhattan, takes its name from a Federal-style house in the area which had been named after the manor of Chelsea, London. Notable people named Chelsea (or variants) include:    Chelsea  Chelsea, ring name of American actress, model, television personality, dancer, and former professional wrestling valet Alison Skipper Chelsea Abdullah, Kuwaiti-American writer Chelsea Alden (born 1988), American actress Chelsea Angelo (born 1996), Australian racecar driver Chelsea Ashurst (born 1990), English professional footballer Chelsea Aubry (born 1984), Canadian professional basketball player Chelsea Baker (born 1986), Australian NRLW player Chelsea Barber, British cast member of Geordie Shore (series 14) Chelsea Biddell (born 1998), Australian AFLW player Chelsea Brandwood, Canadian curler Chelsea Bremner (born 1995), New Zealand rugby union player Chelsea Brook (born 1998), Australian WNBL player Chelsea Brown (1942–2017), American actress, comedian, and dancer Chelsea Buckland (born 1990), Canadian soccer player Chelsea Cain (born 1972), American writer of novels and columns Chelsea Carey (born 1984), Canadian curler Chelsea Cawley, Irish murder victim Chelsea Chandler (born 1994), American mixed martial artist Chelsea Charms (born 1976), American big-bust model, Internet model, and stripper Chelsea Chen (born 1983), American organist and composer Chelsea Chenault (born 1994), American swimmer Chelsea Clark (1983–2014), Canadian Paralympic athlete Chelsea Clark (actress) (born 1998), Canadian actress Chelsea Clinton (born 1980), American writer, global health advocate, and daughter of former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former U.S. Kettle Bottom is a collection of historical poems published in 2004 by Perugia Press in Florence, Massachusetts and written by Diane Gilliam Fisher.

Alison was a regular fashion& jewelry model for the Home Shopping Network( HSN), and hosted\" The College Experiment\" on Fox Sports from 2009 to 2011. == Early life and career ==\nSkipper was born in Orlando, Florida where she still resides and is now twice divorced. She attended the University of Central Florida. Skipper took up dancing and modeling at a young age. She has modeled for Lucky, Vogue, Hyatt Hotels, Breezes Resorts, Body Glove, Kumho Tires, Boost Mobile, Ron Jon Surf Shop, Nike, Victoria's Secret, Macy's and Nordstrom. She has also been featured in television commercials for Walt Disney World and Papa John's Pizza. Alison was a regular fashion & jewelry model for the Home Shopping Network (HSN), and hosted \"The College Experiment\" on Fox Sports from 2009 to 2011.\n\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n\nSkipper signed with TNA Wrestling, and debuted under the name Chelsea during the Genesis pay-per-view January 17, 2010. She aligned herself with Desmond Wolfe at the event, where he defeated D'Angelo Dinero. She would continue to appear accompany Wolfe to the ring as he feuded with D'Angelo Dinero, at times even helping him cheat to win matches.\nWolfe later began a feud with Abyss, after Chelsea said she wanted the hall-of-fame ring Abyss won from Ric Flair. Chelsea accused Abyss of assault and he was arrested, she later acknowledged that she had planned with Wolfe to falsely accuse him. Wolfe challenged Abyss to a match at Sacrifice (2010); if Wolfe won, he got the hall-of-fame ring, but if Abyss won, he would win Chelsea's services for 30 days. On the following edition of Impact!, Chelsea started showing sympathy towards Abyss, when he was being brutalized by Wolfe. The following month at Slammiversary VIII, Wolfe was defeated by Abyss in a Monster's Ball match, when Chelsea turned on him and helped Abyss pick up the victory. On the June 17, 2010 episode of Impact! Chelsea reluctantly returned to Wolfe after her 30 days with Abyss were up, and Wolfe gave her a chance to redeem herself, but her behaviour outside the ring provided a distraction which cost Wolfe his match against Flair's nemesis Jay Lethal for a spot in Flair's stable Fourtune.\nAfter failing to make it into Fourtune, Wolfe went on to form a tag team with fellow Briton Magnus and together the two were named London Brawling, a team that was managed by Chelsea. The team earned themselves the right to challenge for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, and were scheduled to receive their shot against then-champions The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) at No Surrender, but were at the last minute pulled from the event, with TNA citing a \"personal issue\" as the reason. It was later reported that Wolfe was pulled from the event due to an undisclosed medical condition that would sideline him for the next few months, with Wolfe later revealing that at this time, he tested positive for Hepatitis B. On-screen, his absence was explained by Magnus, who claimed that in an attempt to become a dual athlete, Wolfe had travelled to London to try out for Chelsea F.C. During this team, Chelsea was written off on 16 December episode of Impact!, where Magnus met his former tag team partner Doug Williams and informed him that Wolfe was now done with Chelsea (the football club) and would be coming back soon, while also telling him that in the meantime they had gotten rid of Chelsea (their manager) too. On February 9, 2011, it was reported that Skipper had been released by TNA. Rafe Kovich and Alison Barrington Kovich are a supercouple from the American soap opera\" Port Charles\".

Terrence Vance Gilliam ( GIL-ee-əm; born 22 November 1940) is an American–born British filmmaker, comedian, collage animator and actor. He gained stardom as a member of the Monty Python comedy troupe alongside John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, and Graham Chapman. Together they collaborated on the sketch series Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969–1974) and the films Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975, which Gilliam directed as well), Life of Brian (1979) and The Meaning of Life (1983). In 1988, they received the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. In 2009, Gilliam received the BAFTA Fellowship for lifetime achievement. Gilliam transitioned to directing serious films with themes exploring imagination and oppositions to bureaucracy and authoritarianism. His films are sometimes set in dystopian worlds and involve black comedy and tragicomedic elements. He has directed 13 feature films, gaining acclaim for Time Bandits (1981), Brazil (1985), The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), The Fisher King (1991), 12 Monkeys (1995), and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998). He later directed The Brothers Grimm (2005), Tideland (2005), The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009), The Zero Theorem (2013), and The Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018).  Gilliam was born in Minnesota, but spent his high school and college years in Los Angeles. He started his career as an animator and strip cartoonist. He joined Monty Python as the animator of their works, but eventually became a full member and was given acting roles. The only Monty Python member not born in Britain, Gilliam became a naturalised British citizen in 1968 and formally renounced his American citizenship in 2006.    Early life and education  Terry Gilliam was born on 22 November 1940 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Beatrice (née Vance) and James Hall Gilliam. His father was a travelling salesman for Folgers before becoming a carpenter. Soon after, they moved to nearby Medicine Lake, Minnesota. In 1952, the family moved to the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Panorama City. Gilliam attended Birmingham High School, where he was the president of his class and senior prom king, and was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" having achieved straight A grades. During high school, he began to avidly read Mad magazine, then edited by Harvey Kurtzman, which would later influence Gilliam's work. Gilliam graduated from Occidental College in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. In 2003, he told Salman Rushdie about defining experiences in the 1960s that set the foundations for his views on the world:  I became terrified that I was going to be a full-time, bomb-throwing terrorist if I stayed [in the US] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles. ... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way. ... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, \"No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do.\" Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop. ... And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the US is still standing.    Career     1965–1969: Animation and move to England  Gilliam began his career as an animator and strip cartoonist. One of his early photographic strips for the US magazine Help! featured future Python cast member John Cleese. When Help! folded, Gilliam went to Europe, jokingly announcing in the final issue that he was \"being transferred to the European branch\" of the magazine, which did not exist.

Of Kettle Bottom, Catherine MacDonald says \"Set in 1920–21, a period of violent unrest known as the West Virginia Mine Wars, the poems in Kettle Bottom combine compelling narratives with the charged, heightened language of lyric poetry. It is an unforgettable combination, one that characterizes the very best contemporary verse.\"\nDiane won the $50,000 \"Gift of Freedom\" Award for her poetry from A Room of Her Own Foundation in March 2013.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFull-Length Poetry Collections\n\nKettle Bottom (Perguia Press, 2004)\nOne of Everything (Cleveland State University Poetry Center, 2003)\nChapbooks\n\nRecipe for Blackberry Cake (Kent State University Press, 1999)\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n2013  $50,000 Gift of Freedom Award from A Room of Her Own Foundation \n2008 Thomas and Lillie D.

The appeal involved Lotan Fisher and Ron Schwartz, Brogeland's teammates from the previous year when they won the Spingold. Brogeland spent the following day reviewing the Vugraph records from the quarter- final and concluded that Fisher and Schwartz were cheating and later that month created a web site and publicly accused them of cheating. In September 2015, Per- Ola Cullin, a Swedish international bridge player, postulated that after removing the board from the bidding tray, Fisher and Schwartz placed it in particular locations as a code to indicate strength in a suit. The analysis was based on video from the European Bridge Team Championship in Croatia in 2014. Both the European Bridge League and the Israel Bridge Federation conducted an investigation into the allegations. The Israel Bridge Federation hearings also includes an allegation related to coughing. On September 5, 2015, Israel withdrew its team for the upcoming Bermuda Bowl in Bali. They were replaced by Sweden. In May 2016 three Israeli experts announced what they believe is a refinement to the Cullin code. The experts include Dr. Netzer Zeidenberg, a computer scientist and Amir Levin, Israel's 2003 bridge champion. Fisher and Schwartz responded,\" We are innocent of any crime and we will fight for our innocence. We already successfully passed a polygraph that proved that we are innocent.\" Fisher and Schwartz were subsequently banned from all European Bridge League events in May 2016 by its Disciplinary Commission for a period of five years, and banned from playing as a partnership for life. The Committee's full report was released on May 18, 2016 as the Decision of the European Bridge League Disciplinary Committee. On July 28, 2016, the American Contract Bridge League( ACBL) announced that its Ethical Oversight Committee( chair: Jon Brissman; other members: Cheri Bjerkan, Dennis Clerkin, Lesley Davis, Bruce Ferguson, Bob Glasson, Hendrik Sharples and Eddie Wold) had unanimously found Fisher and Schwartz guilty both of collusive cheating and of giving false information to the ACBL about previous disciplinary convictions. In consequence, Fisher and Schwartz were expelled from the ACBL, and all their masterpoints, titles, ranks and privileges declared forfeit. Further, their partners and teammates were subject to mandatory forfeiture of all masterpoints, titles and ranks earned during the four years preceding the final of the 2015 Spingold Trophy. On July 29, 2016, the ACBL clarified and corrected that announcement: forfeiture by partners and teammates applied only to events in which they had played with Fisher or Schwartz, and only to the four years preceding the date of the decision, namely July 27, 2016. </onlyinclude> On August 8, 2016, the Israeli Special Ethics Committee unanimously found Fisher and Schwartz guilty of signaling by means of board placement and on February 14, 2017, announced that Fisher and Schwartz are permanently banned from play and participation in any activities within the Israeli Bridge Federation. MegaCon, short for Mega Convention, is a large speculative fiction convention that caters to the comic book, sci-fi, anime, fantasy, RPG, and gaming communities, often occurring in spring at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida. The convention is the largest fan convention event in the Southern United States and second largest in North America with an attendance of 190,000 recorded in 2024.    History     Founding  The first comic book convention held in the Orlando area was OrlandoCon, held annually from 1974 to c. 1994. Regular guests included C. C. Beck, Floyd Gottfredson, and Hal Foster. MegaCon was founded by James Breitbiel and first held in 1993 at the Orlando Expo Center (Now the UCF Center for Emerging Media). The convention was acquired by the Tampa-based publisher CrossGen in 1999, with Elizabeth Widera brought on to run the show in 2000 and Breitbiel moving on to become CrossGen's Marketing and Distribution Director. During this period, from 2000 to 2003, MegaCon heavily promoted CrossGen products as the show continued to grow. After being the venue once in 1997, the Orange County Convention Center has since 2001, been the host of the convention. The new location allowed MegaCon to be the home of the long-running \"Paranoia LIVE!\" from 2001 to 2019. LARP, based on Mongoose Publishing's Paranoia. In 2002, the logo was changed to one with rounded rectangular letters with a capital \"G\" in lowercase size. 2003 introduced after hours entertainment at the convention. This expanded to offsite locations in 2006. In late 2003, Widera purchased the convention from the failing CrossGen, which was restructuring (the publisher went bankrupt in 2004). Widera, who is a board member of the comics charity The Hero Initiative, ran the show along with her daughter Christine Alger until 2016. In 2007, MegaCon hosted the first live presentation of the Web Cartoonists' Choice Awards. This was followed in August 2008 with the convention hosting the first inaugural Project Fanboy Awards ceremony, awarding authors, writers and publishers with honors voted on by Internet users on the Project Fanboy website. Following 2009, the Project Fanboy Awards event was discontinued. In September 2008, MegaCon headquarters moved from Safety Harbor to Live Oak, Florida, although the actual convention remains in Orlando. In 2009, in addition to the main show, held February 27–March 1, convention organizers produced a \"mini-MegaCon\" held August 22–23 featuring a number of actors from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV show.    Fan Expo   On April 7, 2015, it was announced that MegaCon had been sold to Informa. The con now operates under the auspices of Informa's Fan Expo group, although it has maintained the MegaCon branding. Following MegaCon 2015 it was announced that for the first time MegaCon will be extended to 4 days in 2016. as well as another mini-MegaCon event, \"MegaCon Fan Days\" in November 21–22, 2015. Shortly after MegaCon 2016, MegaCon Tampa Bay was announced for October 28–30. MegaCon Tampa last happened in 2018 and has not returned since due to the increasing sizes of convention rivals Tampa Bay Comic Con and Metrocon as well as the size limitations of the Tampa Convention Center.

Kettle Bottom is a collection of historical poems published in 2004 by Perugia Press in Florence, Massachusetts and written by Diane Gilliam Fisher. The collection's deep focus is on the West Virginia labor battles of 1920 and 1921, such as the Battle of Matewan and Battle of Blair Mountain. Kettle Bottom was named Top Ten Poetry Book for 2005 by American Booksellers Association Book Sense, was winner of the Ohioana Library Association Poetry Book of the Year, was a finalist for the Weatherford Award of the Appalachian Studies Association, and selected for inclusion in The Pushcart Prize XXX: Best of the Small Presses.    Author's Note  In the Author's Note at the beginning of Kettle Bottom, Fisher explains the cause of the conflict between the West Virginia miners and the company owners and operators: \"Subsistence wages, the unwillingness of coal operators to slow production for safety reasons, their intransigence with regard to the rights of the miners to organize—these conditions made enemies of the miners and the operators. The situation was aggravated by the organization of life in the camps, which the companies controlled in every respect. Housing was owned by the company; trade was often limited to company-owned stores; the company brought in the doctor, often built the school and brought in the teacher, built the church and supplied the preacher.\"    Structure  Kettle Bottom consists of 50 poems, which are divided into three sections: I. Summer ~ Fall, II. Raven Light, and III. Winter ~ Summer. The collection is structured to read as a narrative; the poems written chronologically into one coherent, suspenseful plot.  \"Raven's Light,\" the only poem in the collection's middle section and the longest poem of all the sections, divides the plot between the time before the miners' rebellion (section I, Summer and Fall) and the time after the miners' rebellion (section III, Winter and Summer).    Language  Diane Gilliam Fisher shows a mastery of language in this collection. One of the strongest literary devices she employs in her poems is an acute sense of dialect and voice, which not only matches time and place (early 1920s in West Virginia), but also character. Her collection is crafted using persona poems. Each is written specifically from one individual's or character's perspective, although the individual who is a particular poem's narrator varies significantly throughout the collection. This unique ability to go outside herself to capture the personalities and viewpoints of others is shown immediately in Diane Gilliam Fisher's opening poem of Kettle Bottom: Explosion at Winco No. 9 Delsey Salyer knowed Tom Junior by his toes, which his steel-toed boots had kept the fire off of. Betty Rose seen a piece of Willy's ear, the little notched part where a hound had bit him when he was a young'un, playing at eating its food. It is true that it is the men that goes in, but it is us  that carries the mine inside. It is us that listens  to what all they are scared of and takes the weight of it from them, like handing off  a sack of meal. Us that learns by heart birthmarks, scars, bends of fingers, how the teeth set crooked or straight. Us that picks up the pieces.  I didn't have nothing to patch with but my old blue dress, and Ted didn't want flowered goods on his shirt. I told him, It's just under your arm, Ted, it ain't going to show.  They brung out bodies, you couldn't tell. I seen a piece of my old blue dress on one of them bodies, blacked with smoke, but I could tell it was my patch, up under the arm. When the man writing in the big black book come around asking about identifying marks, I said, blue dress. I told him, Maude Stanley, 23.    Theme  The powerful message that Kettle Bottom conveys to its readers is a realization of the horrific history of labor in America and the corruption that circulated during this time, causing dangerous work conditions and inhumane treatment of workers.    Characters  The characters of Diane Gilliam Fisher's poems range from the children, wives, and family of the coal miners, the immigrant works, the company owners and operators, to the news reporters who were brought in to report on the rebellion. One of the most compelling persona poems in the collection tells the life story of an Italian immigrant who came to America with the dream of becoming an expert stonecutter and architect: David At home, in Carrara, Papa he is mastro di tagliapietra, master stonecutter, maker of beautiful buildings and bridges. Godwin Davy( born 15 December 1979) is an Anguillan international footballer who plays as a goalkeeper. He made his international debut in a World Cup qualifying match against El Salvador, resulting in a lopsided match, losing 12- 0 in February 2008, and also played in the 4 – 0 loss to the same country in the return match in March 2008.

Pieporus, king of Dacian Costoboci – 2nd century AD (inscription) Tarbus – 2nd century AD. Dio Cassius mentioned him without specifying his origin. Rhescuporis II was king of the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace from ca. 18 BC to ca. 13 BC, in succession to his father Cotys VII.\nIn 48 BC, before he became king, he led a body of auxiliaries his father sent to the aid of Pompey for use in the Roman civil war against Julius Caesar. After Cotys VII's death he became king, at first under the guardianship of his uncle Rhoemetalces I, his father's younger brother.\nRhescuporis died in 13 BC when he was defeated and slain in battle by Vologaeses, chief of the Thracian Bessi, who was a leader in the revolt against the Romans in that year. He left no heir, and so was succeeded by Rhoemetalces, who fled Thrace during the revolt and was restored to power by Augustus after it was suppressed.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSmith, William, ed. Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology. Boston : Little, Brown, and Company, 1867, v. 3, p. 646 Rhescuporis I (Greek: Τιβέριος Ἰούλιος Ῥησκούπορις Α' Φιλοκαῖσαρ Φιλορωμαῖος Eὐσεβής, Tiberios Iulios Rheskouporis Philocaesar Philoromaios Eusebes, flourished 1st century, died 93), often alternatively enumerated as Rhescuporis II, was a Roman client king of the Bosporan Kingdom.\n\n\n== Life ==\nRhescuporis I was the son and heir of the Roman Client King Cotys I and Roman Client Queen Eunice. He was of Greek, Iranian and Roman ancestry. His paternal uncle Mithridates, was a previous Bosporan King.\nHis paternal grandmother was the late Bosporan Roman Client Queen Gepaepyris. Through her, Rhescuporis I was a descendant of the Roman Triumvir Mark Antony from his second marriage to his paternal cousin Antonia Hybrida Minor (second daughter of Roman Republican Politician Gaius Antonius Hybrida, Antony's paternal uncle), thus Rhescuporis I was related to various members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Through Gepaepyris, he was a descendant of Roman Client Rulers Polemon I of Pontus, Pythodorida of Pontus and Cotys VIII of Thrace. The name of Rhescuporis I is an ancestral monarch name of Thracian origin that derived from the family of his paternal grandmother.\nHis paternal grandfather was the late Bosporan Roman Client King Aspurgus. Through him, Rhescuporis I, was a descendant of the Greek Macedonian Kings: Antigonus I Monophthalmus, Seleucus I Nicator and the regent, Antipater. These three men served under King Alexander the Great. Through his grandfather, Rhescuporis I was a descendant of the monarchs Mithridates VI of Pontus and his first wife, his sister Laodice and the previous Bosporan King Asander.\n\n\n=== Reign ===\nLittle is known of the life of Rhescuporis I. In 63 for unknown reasons, the Roman Emperor Nero disposed Cotys I, and his fate afterwards is unknown. The Bosporan Kingdom was incorporated as a part of the Roman Province of Moesia Inferior from 63 to 68. Perhaps Nero wanted to minimize the role, power and influence of local client rulers and desired the Bosporan to be completely governed by the Roman state.\nIn June 68, Nero had died and Galba succeeded Nero as Roman Emperor. With the help from his mother, Rhescuporis I successfully attempted to have the Bosporan Kingdom restored as a client kingdom to him from Galba. He was able to make the Bosporan Kingdom stable and semi-independent once more. At least in the first year of his reign, his mother co-ruled with him and acted as his regent. The Bosporan Kingdom was able to continue their trade with Anatolia. His royal title on coins is in Greek: ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΡΗΣΚΟΥΠΟΡΙΔΟΣ or of King Rhescuporis. Rhescuporis I was a contemporary of the rule to the Year of the Four Emperors, the Flavian dynasty, in particular the reign of Roman Emperor Domitian.\nRhescuporis I reigned as king until AD 93. His wife is unknown, but from this marriage he had a son Sauromates I, who succeeded him. Through Sauromates I, Rhescuporis I had many descendants who ruled the Bosporan throne until the mid-4th century, four of whom bore his name.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Crimea\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nA dictionary of the Roman Empire, By Matthew Bunson, Edition: illustrated Published by Oxford University Press US, 1995, ISBN 0-19-510233-9, ISBN 978-0-19-510233-8 Paula Elaine Downing King( December 8, 1951- December 17, 2017), who wrote as Paula E.

Hüma Hatun (1410 ‒ September 1449) was the fourth wife of Ottoman Sultan Murad II and mother of Mehmed II and the grandmother of Bayezid II. James Reynolds McAllister (born 26 April 1978 in Glasgow) is a Scottish former player who played as a defender and currently working as a professional football coach with Brunei club DPMM which plays in the Singapore Premier League. McAllister played for Queen of the South, Aberdeen, Livingston, Heart of Midlothian, Bristol City, Preston North End, Yeovil Town, Kerala Blasters and Exeter City. He made one full international appearance for Scotland, in 2004. Since retiring as a player he has been an assistant coach at Bristol City, Sunderland and Hibernian.     Club career     Early career  McAllister signed an \"S\" form with Motherwell Boys Club, before being released from his contract by then Motherwell manager Alex McLeish. McAllister then joined Bellshill Boys Club where he played alongside David Lilley.    Queen of the South  McAllister began his senior career in 1996 by signing for Dumfries club Queen of the South with new chairman Norman Blount getting the wheels moving on the club's revival. At Palmerston Park McAllister and Lilley became teammates again. In 1997 the club reached the Scottish Challenge Cup final for the first time. Second division Queen of the South lost 1–0 to First division Falkirk despite a rousing Queens display at Motherwell's Fir Park Stadium; a performance that included the man of the match award going to Queens veteran central midfield playmaker Tommy Bryce and an early career appearance for McAllister as substitute. A late chance for a Derek Townsley equaliser went agonisingly over for Queens. McAllister became one of the most sought after players in the lower leagues and was courted by several Scottish Premier League clubs before leaving at the end of the season in 1999.    Aberdeen  Ebbe Skovdahl signed him for Aberdeen for a fee of £85,000 with further add ons as he made more appearances, resulting in a final fee of over £100,000.  Lilley became his teammate at the third successive club. He scored once during his spell in Aberdeen, his strike coming in a 2–0 Scottish Cup win over his future club Livingston on 26 January 2002.    Livingston  In June 2003 Livingston signed McAllister on a free transfer after competition from English clubs. It was in this spell at the West Lothian club that he regained his form and won a deserved call up from Berti Vogts for the International friendly match against Trinidad and Tobago. It was also during his spell at Livingston that he won the Scottish League Cup after a 2–0 victory over Hibernian in which he scored the second goal in the final. His only other goal for Livingston came in a 3–1 league win against Motherwell on 14 February 2004.    Heart of Midlothian  At the end of the 2003–04 season McAllister's contract expired and he agreed a two-year deal to sign for Heart of Midlothian. During his spell at Tynecastle he was mainly used as a squad player, due to the outstanding form of Takis Fyssas and the signing of Jose Goncalves. In January 2006, McAllister agreed a two-year contract extension; however he was soon dissatisfied with his peripheral status at the club, particularly after the appointment of Valdas Ivanauskas as Hearts manager in April. McAllister scored twice during his spell at Hearts with both goals coming in the Scottish Cup. His first came in the 2004–05 season against former club Livingston, and his second came the following season against Kilmarnock.    Bristol City   On 2 August 2006 McAllister signed for Bristol City on a two-year contract. In his first season at the Ashton Gate stadium he helped the club gain promotion to the Championship. In his second season McAllister was a mainstay of the team that made it to the final of the Championship play-offs. On 24 May 2008 Hull City defeated Bristol City 1–0 to reach the English Premier League with a goal from Dean Windass after 38 minutes. On 10 March 2009 he scored his first goal in over a year with a curling effort from the edge of the box against Coventry City. On 2 October 2008 McAllister was recalled to the Scotland squad by manager George Burley for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Norway.    Yeovil Town  Having been released by Bristol City at the end of the 2011–12 season, McAllister signed for Football League One side Yeovil Town on a two-year contract linking up with former manager Gary Johnson. Tiberius Julius Rhescuporis III Philocaesar Philoromaios Eusebes, also known as Rhescuporis III(\" Philocaesar Philoromaios Eusebes\", means\" lover of Caesar, lover of Rome who is the Pius one\", flourished 3rd century – died 227) was a prince and Roman Client King of the Bosporan Kingdom. Rhescuporis III was the son and heir of Bosporan King Rhescuporis II by an unnamed woman and was of Greek, Iranian and Roman ancestry. In 210/211 the paternal grandfather of Rhescuporis III, King Sauromates II died, Rhescuporis III succeeded with his father Rhescuporis II. Rhescuporis III co-ruled with his father as Bosporan Kings until their deaths in 227. His royal title on coins is in Greek:\" ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΡΗΣΚΟΥΠΟΡΙΔΟΣ\" or\" King Rhescuporis\". In 221, in the seaport city located in the Black Sea called Amastris( modern Amasra) there was an honorific inscription dedicated to Rhescuporis III. The inscription describes Rhescuporis III as: He was a contemporary to the rule of the Roman Emperors Caracalla, Macrinus, Elagabalus and Alexander Severus. Little is known of the life and reign of Rhescuporis III. In the year he and his father died, they were succeeded by Cotys III, a brother of Rhescuporis II and paternal uncle to Rhescuporis III.

It may also be of locational origin, e.g., Kingston upon Hull on the River Hull in Yorkshire, or derive from the personal name Hulle, a pet form of Hugh. The name spread from the British Isles throughout the Anglosphere. The first notable bearer of the name in North America, a brother of the Rev. Joseph Hull, was George Hull (1590–1659) of Crewkerne, Somerset, who in 1630 sailed on the Mary and John from Plymouth, Devon, in cooperation with the Winthrop Fleet, and helped in the Puritan founding of Dorchester, which he represented at the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Hull later surveyed lands for the new Colony of Connecticut, including Windsor and Wethersfield; helped found Fairfield; and served as a representative to the General Court and as assistant to his good friend Roger Ludlow, who appointed him associate magistrate for towns along the shoreline.

Tiberius Julius Rhescuporis IV, also known as Rhescuporis IV( flourished 3rd century – died 235) was a prince and Roman Client King of the Bosporan Kingdom. Rhescuporis IV was the second born son to the Bosporan King Cotys III and his mother was an unnamed Sarmatian noble woman. He was of Greek, Iranian and Roman ancestry. He had two brothers: one oldest called Sauromates III and a younger called Ininthimeus. Rhescuporis IV was named in honor of his paternal uncle previous Bosporan King Rhescuporis II and his paternal cousin, previous Bosporan King Rhescuporis III, who co-ruled with his father, Rhescuporis II. Rhescuporis IV in 233 succeeded Sauromates III after his death. His first brother was first co-ruler in the reign of their father Cotys III. Rhescuporis IV was co-ruler with Cotys III, until he died in 235. His royal title on coins is in Greek:\" ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΡΗΣΚΟΥΠΟΡΙΔΟΣ\" or\" of King Rhescuporis\". Rhescuporis IV was a contemporary to the rule of the Roman Emperor Alexander Severus. Little is known of the life and reign of Rhescuporis IV. In 235, Rhescuporis IV was succeeded by his brother Ininthimeus. Rhescuporis II was king of half of the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace from 12 to 18, in succession to his brother Rhoemetalces I, and briefly ruler of the entire realm thereafter, usurping the other half from nephew Cotys VIII. He was a son of the earlier Thracian king Cotys VI and the younger brother of kings Cotys VII and Rhoemetalces I. The Roman Historian Tacitus describes his character as \"treacherous\". On the death of Rhoemetalces, Emperor Augustus divided Thrace into two separate kingdoms, one half for Cotys VIII to rule and the other half for Rhescuporis II. Tacitus states that Cotys received the cultivated parts, most towns and most Greek cities of Thrace, while Rhescuporis received the wild and savage portion with enemies on its frontier. Rhescuporis wanted to annex Cotys’ kingdom, but was prevented from doing so from fear of Augustus. Augustus' death in 14 emboldened him, and he initiated efforts to obtain the remainder of Thrace, at first by negotiation, but afterwards, when Cotys proved resistant, by treachery. Inviting his nephew to a banquet to falsely ratify a treaty between them, he arrested and imprisoned Cotys, seizing his kingdom. Cotys died while incarcerated in 18, allegedly by suicide. His wife and children fled Thrace to Cyzicus to escape Rhescuporis. The Roman Emperor Tiberius opened an investigation into Cotys’ death, putting Rhescuporis on trial in the Roman Senate. He invited Cotys' widow Tryphaena to testify at the trial, during which she accused the defendant of murdering her husband. Rhescuporis was found guilty, and Tiberius sent him to live in exile in Alexandria, Egypt. En route, Rhescuporis tried to escape and was killed by Roman soldiers. His son, who would later rule Thrace as Rhoemetalces III, was spared by Tiberius and allowed to return to Thrace. In the meantime Tiberius returned the whole Thracian Kingdom to Tryphaena and appointed Rhoemetalces II, her eldest child with Cotys, as coruler. == Sources ==\nSmith, William, ed.

Rhoemetalces I was a loyal ally to the first Roman Emperor Augustus. He was a direct descendant of the Thracian King Cotys I, and the middle son of the earlier Thracian king Cotys IV. His younger brother was Rhescuporis II. When Cotys VII died about 48 BC Rhoemetalces became the guardian of his nephew Rhescuporis I, his brother's young son and heir. Rhescuporis I died in 13 BC, when he was defeated and slain in battle by Vologases, chief of the Thracian Bessi, who was a leader in the revolt against the Romans in that year. During this revolt Rhoemetalces and his family fled Thrace, returning only when it ended, when Augustus returned the kingdom to his family. As Rhescuporis I had left no heir, Rhoemetalces became King of Thrace in 12 BC. The Roman Historian Tacitus, describes him as ‘ attractive and civilized ’. His wife and the mother of his heir, known only through numismatic evidence, was Queen Pythodoris[ I]. Rhoemetalces I ruled Thrace until his death in 12. Augustus then divided his realm into two separate kingdoms, one half for his son Cotys VIII to rule and the other half for Rhoemetalces's remaining brother Rhescuporis II. Tacitus states that Cotys received the cultivated parts, most towns and most Greek cities of Thrace, while Rhescuporis received the wild and savage portion with enemies on its frontier. Rhoemetalces II was a Client Ruler in association with his mother Antonia Tryphaena of the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace under the Romans from 18 to 38. On coinage his royal title is in Greek: ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΡΟΙΜΗΤΑΛΚΑΣ or of King Rhoemetalces. Rhoemetalces II and Tryphaena succeeded his paternal great- uncle Rhescuporis II, who had usurped the throne from Rhoemetalces II's father Cotys VIII. The Roman Emperor Tiberius deposed Rhescuporis II and installed Rhoemetalces II and Tryphaena on the throne in his place. They served as loyal client rulers, even in 26 putting down Thracian malcontents for Tiberius. Rhoemetalces II never married and had no children. After his death in 38, his cousin Rhoemetalces III, the son of Rhescuporis II, was appointed king, while his mother retired to live as a private citizen in Cyzicus. Rhoemetalces II (Greek: Ροιμητάλκης) was a Client Ruler in association with his mother Antonia Tryphaena of the Sapaean kingdom of Thrace under the Romans. He ruled from 19 until 38 AD. Rhoemetalces II and Tryphaena succeeded his paternal great-uncle Rhescuporis II, who had usurped the throne from Rhoemetalces II's father Cotys VIII. The Roman Emperor Tiberius deposed Rhescuporis II and installed Rhoemetalces II and Tryphaena on the throne in his place. They served as loyal client rulers, even in 26 putting down Thracian malcontents for Tiberius. Rhoemetalces II never married and had no children. After his death in 38, his father's cousin Rhoemetalces III, the son of Rhescuporis II, was appointed king, while his mother retired to live as a private citizen in Cyzicus.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCoinage of Rhoemetalces II Gregory Breit (Ukrainian: Григорій Альфредович Брейт-Шнайдер, Russian: Григорий Альфредович Брейт-Шнайдер, romanized: Grigory Alfredovich Breit-Shneider; July 14, 1899 – September 13, 1981) was an American physicist born in Mykolaiv, Russian Empire (now Mykolaiv, Ukraine). He was a professor at New York University (1929–1934), University of Wisconsin–Madison (1934–1947), Yale University (1947–1968), and University at Buffalo (1968–1973). In 1921, he was Paul Ehrenfest's assistant in Leiden University.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in the city of Mykolaiv in the family of the book publisher Alfred Schneider. After the death of his mother in 1911, his father left for the United States of America. Until 1915, Gregory studied at the Mykolaiv Oleksandrivska gymnasium. In 1915, he followed his father to USA. He studied at Johns Hopkins University: in 1918 he obtained a Bachelor degree, in 1920 a Master degree, and in 1921 he earned a PhD in physics. In 1921-1922, he worked as a researcher at Leiden University.\nIn 1922-1923, he was a research fellow at Harvard University. From 1923 to 1924, he was an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota. In 1925, while at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Breit joined with Merle Tuve in using a pulsed radio transmitter to determine the height of the ionosphere, a technique important later in radar development.\nTogether with Eugene Wigner, Breit gave a description of particle resonant states with the relativistic Breit–Wigner distribution in 1929, and with Edward Condon, he first described proton-proton dispersion. He is also credited with deriving the Breit equation. The Breit frame of reference is named after him. He was one of the first to notice the zitterbewegung (jittery motion) in the solutions of the Dirac equation.\nIn 1934, together with John A. Wheeler, Breit described the Breit–Wheeler process. In 1939 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In April 1940, he proposed to the National Research Council that American scientists observe a policy of self-censorship due to the possibility of their work being used for military purposes by enemy powers in World War II.\nDuring the early stages of the war, Breit was chosen by Arthur Compton to supervise the early design of the first atomic bomb during an early phase in what would later become the Manhattan Project. Breit resigned his position in 1942, feeling that the work was going too slowly and that there had been security breaches on the project; his job went to Robert Oppenheimer, who was later appointed to scientific director of what became Project Y, the design and testing of the weapon.\nIn 2014, experimentalists proposed a way to validate an idea by Breit and John A. Wheeler that matter formation could be achieved by interacting light particles (\"Breit–Wheeler process\").\nBreit was associate editor of the Physical Review four times (1927-1929, 1939-1941, 1954-1956, and 1961-1963).\nHe was elected in 1923 a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He was awarded the Franklin Medal in 1964.

McAllister Hull (September 1, 1923 – February 9, 2011) was a North American theoretical physicist who took part in the creation of the atomic bomb that was dropped over Nagasaki in 1945, ending World War II.    Early years  Hull was born on September 1, 1923, in Birmingham, Alabama.  In his memoir, he describes how, in his boyhood, he read Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, and other science-fiction writers, and discovered physics and Albert Einstein while doing school projects. In a 2004 letter to the New York Review of Books, Hull wrote that his father had \"tried to enlist\" in General John J. Pershing's expedition to bring Pancho Villa to justice, \"but needed his mother’s permission, which was not given. In 1917, he did enlist, and went to France with Pershing in the 4th Alabama, where he was in combat until wounded at Soissons, and in hospital service until 1919.\" In the autumn of 1941, Hull entered Mississippi State University to study physics.  After his freshman year, according to a 2007 newspaper profile, \"he quit school and became a draftsman for an ordnance plant, where he was trained to test explosives to see if they were pure enough to be used for shells.\"    Personal  Hull was married for 65 years to Mary Muska Hull, who survived him.  They had two children, John Hull and Wendy McCabe, and three grandchildren, Isaac Hull, Damaris McDonald and Ursula McCabe. In 2007 he listed his pastimes as \"studying serious music, theater and art history\" and said that in earlier years he had been interested in \"flying light planes, mountain hiking, skydiving and building furniture.\"    The Army and Los Alamos  In 1943, Hull was drafted into the Army Specialized Training Program, which identified enlisted personnel who had technical skills or some science education. He was assigned to the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In the autumn of 1944, Hull and three other men were ordered to take a train from Oak Ridge to Lamy, New Mexico, where Hull dialed a number he had been told to call.  A bus showed up and took Hull and his companions to Los Alamos.  \"I never saw those men again,\" Hull later recalled.  Although he had only a high-school diploma, he had been identified as promising student of physics.  He was put to work developing methods for, and overseeing, the casting of explosive lenses which would compress a plutonium core, resulting in an implosion.  Hull, a sergeant, acted as foreman, supervising the team of civilians who worked on the casting. During the months when he worked on the project to create Fat Man, the atomic bomb that would be dropped over Nagasaki, he was not told explicitly that he was working on a bomb. \"But I knew enough physics to figure out what was going on.\"  His work, which lasted until the summer of 1945, was considered so dangerous that the lab where he worked with his team was 15 miles from the other scientists' labs. In order to cast the explosives, according to the New York Times, Hull used candy kettles and malted-milk stirrers.  \"We actually used a candy kettle ... to melt the explosives and then poured them into the mold to make the lenses,\" Hull told MSNBC in an interview.  An article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists tells the story this way: \"One of Hull's early assignments was to figure our how to eliminate air bubbles in the explosive lenses. Remembering his experience making milk shakes as a waiter at college, he devised a stirrer that could be drawn up through the molten mixture, effectively bringing the bubbles to the surface.\" In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the atom bomb, Hull told CBS: \"We were pouring two--two-speed explosives: a slow explosive called baritar, which was barium nitrate and TNT, mainly, and then a faster explosive called Comp-B, which had TNT in it and the rest of it either classified or I don't remember. It was--it was fast.\"  Asked by a CBS reporter whether there had been \"white coats\" or a \"lab atmosphere,\" Hull replied: \"Oh, Lord, no.\" Hull later recalled \"the day that J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of Los Alamos, brought Gen. Leslie Groves out to the lab. While looking at the mold for the lens, Groves accidentally stepped on and disconnected a hot water line. A stream of extremely hot water came out of the socket behind him, hitting him squarely in the rear.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

It was produced by S. Gopala Reddy under the Bhargav Art Productions banner and directed by Kodi Ramakrishna. It stars Nandamuri Balakrishna, Bhanumathi Ramakrishna, Suhasini Maniratnam with music composed by K. V. Mahadevan. The film is a remake of Tamil movie Man Vasanai (1983).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins in a village where Mangamma, an indomitable woman, resides with her valiant grandson Veeranna—the village feuds with adjacent, whose forefront is bloodthirsty Basavaiah. Chantabbai, Mangamma's son-in-law, always brings Basavaiah off in the bullfight, which inflames him. Mangamma & Chantabbai's families have held conflicts for a long time. However, Veeranna darlings his cousin Malli, who wins over their rift, and the elders decide the wedlock. Parallelly, Chantabbai maintains an adulterous fling with a sly Chintamani, her brother Chandarraju's passion for Malli. So, Chantabbai kicks them out when Chintamani entices Basavaiah, and they all conspire on the eve of the bullfight festival. At that point, Basavaiah incites drunkard Chantabbai to knit his daughter, whoever beats his bull, which Chandarraju does by anesthetizing it. As a result, Chantabbai severs himself from the nullification of the bet. After a while, Basavaiah mandated Malli's surrender. Still, the roaring of Mangamma drives them away, and the village looks forward to performing the alliance of Veeranna & Malli. Forthwith, Veeranna proceeds to collect wedding accessories. On his way back, Basavaiah backstabbed him and declared him dead. Being conscious of it, Malli turns insane to save her Brahmachari benevolent teacher letters in Veeranna's name. 1 year later, Malli receives a letter from Veeranna that he is arriving the following day, and she is on cloud nine. She collapses after witnessing Veeranna landing with a Punjabi girl whom everyone supposes he has espoused her. Then, Veeranna spins back while under attack. He assumed that he slays Basavaiah's men. Due to fear of sentence, Veeranna absconded and enrolled in the army. He befriends a soldier, Azim Singh, who died while shielding him in a battle and entrusting his sister's responsibility to Veeranna. Now, Mangamma decides that Veeranna should splice the Punjabi girl. Knowing the current state, the Punjabi girl is about to quit when Malli bars, decorates her as a bride, and attempts suicide just as Basavaiah & Chandarraju abducts her. At last, Mangamma & Veeranna cease the baddies when the Punjabi girl sacrifices her life for Mangamma. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with the marriage of Veeranna & Malli.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nNandamuri Balakrishna as Veeranna\nBhanumathi Ramakrishna as Mangamma\nSuhasini Maniratnam as Malli\nGollapudi Maruthi Rao as Brahmachari Master\nGokina Rama Rao as Chantabbai\nRaavi Kondala Rao\nYeleswaram Ranga as Basavaiah\nTelephone Satyanarayana as President Rayudu\nBalaji as Chandar Raju\nAnitha as Annapurna\nY.

S. Ranga based on Ch. Venkataramaiah's stage play of the same name. Produced for the banner Vikram Productions, it stars NTR, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, V. Nagayya, Bhanumathi Ramakrishna, and Jamuna in key roles. Ranga handled the cinematography with his brother-in-law B. N. Haridas while P. G. Mohan edited the film. Viswanathan–Ramamoorthy composed the soundtrack and background score. Written by Samudrala Sr., Kannadasan, and Murugadasa, Tenali Ramakrishna narrates the story of the 14th century Telugu and Sanskrit poet and scholar of the same name, and his life as a member of the court of Krishnadevaraya, the king of the Vijayanagara Empire. Using his wits, Ramakrishna manages to save Krishnadevaraya from attacks by the Bahmani Sultanate, which tries to invade the Vijayanagara Empire. The rest of the film is about Ramakrishna's efforts to save Krishnadevaraya from courtesan Krishnasani, a spy, and convincing Emperor Babur against extending support to the Sultanate in the war. Produced as a bilingual film shot simultaneously in the Telugu and Tamil languages with a slightly altered cast, Tenali Ramakrishna was filmed in and around Revathy Studios at Madras. It was released on 12 January 1956 to mixed reviews from critics who criticised the historical inaccuracies portrayed in the film. Tenali Ramakrishna was a commercial success, won the President's Silver medal for the Best Feature Film in Telugu and the All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film at the 4th National Film Awards. Its Tamil version, titled Tenali Raman, featured Sivaji Ganesan as the protagonist and was released on 3 February 1956. Tenali Ramakrishna was later remade in Kannada as Hasyaratna Ramakrishna in 1982 by Ranga himself but it was a commercial failure.    Plot  During the reign of the Vijayanagara Empire, a scholarly poet Ramakrishna from Tenali migrated to Hampi with his wife Kamala & son Madhava for credit to his art. Amid, he bars the sacrifice in a Kali temple and succumbs to the tribes' anger. Free of fear, he halts therein when he deserves the goddess grace who bestows him to choose wisdom or wealth. Ramakrishna cleverly takes both, which enrages Kali, and curses him as a Vikatakavi, the clownish poet, i.e., only for the comic. He accepts it as a special blessing.  Ramakrishna reaches Hampi, but the royal priest, Tatacharya, casts him off. Ergo, he addresses the Krishnadevaraya and solves an open question. Entranced, emperor, by his wit & and poetry, designates him as a court member; it begrudges Tatacharya.  Soon, he acquired the faith of Chief Minister Appaji Timmarusu, who talks right behind closed-door negotiations about the jeopardy of the Bahmani Sultanate. Now, the sultans plot to assassinate Raya via a treacherous meddler, Kanakaraju, the distant relative of Ramakrishna.  Meanwhile, Tatacharya puts forces to pose Ramakrishna as a vile before the emperor but fails. After a while, Ramakrishna shelters Kanakaraju, who attempts to slay Raya but is captured. This minute, Tatacharya inculpates Ramakrishna, and the emperor declares the death penalty on him. Just before execution, he fortuitously overhears the conversation of a turncoat court's astrologer bribed by Sultans. So, Ramakrishna smartly absconds and breaks the backstab—Tatacharya is also a defendant for sticking up the astrologer to postpone the battle when Ramakrishna guards him. Subsequently, Ramakrishna's bondage with Rayalu strengthens.  The Bahmani then subterfuges trigger a mole, the courtesan Krishnasani, who has self-retribution on Rayalu—her honey-trapping clutches him and locks him in her cage. The Bahmani exploits its schemes head first, an onslaught together when fraughted Ramakrishna trespasses the emperor's abode, who deaf ears his entreaty. Moreover, he ostracizes him and edicts him to be beheaded for his revert. Listening to it, queen Tirumala Devi collapses when Rayalu eats the crow and backs. Parallelly, Ramakrishna's bell rang for Krishnasani. The body without organs (or BwO; French: corps sans organes or CsO) is a fuzzy concept used in the work of French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. The concept describes the unregulated potential of a body—not necessarily human— without organizational structures imposed on its constituent parts, operating freely. The term was first used by French writer Antonin Artaud in his 1947 play To Have Done With the Judgment of God, later adapted by Deleuze in his book The Logic of Sense, and ambiguously expanded upon by himself and Guattari in both volumes of their work Capitalism and Schizophrenia.  Stemming from the general abstract notion of the body in metaphysics, and the unconscious in psychoanalysis, Deleuze and Guattari theorized that since the conscious and unconscious fantasies in psychosis and schizophrenia express potential forms and functions of the body that demand it to be liberated, the reality of the homeostatic process of the body is that it is limited by its organization and more so by its organs. There are three types of the body without organs; the empty, the full, and the cancerous, according to what the body has achieved.    Background  The phrase \"body without organs\" was first used by the French writer Antonin Artaud in his 1947 text for a play, To Have Done With the Judgment of God. Referring to his ideal for man as a philosophical subject, he wrote in its epilogue that \"When you will have made him a body without organs, then you will have delivered him from all his automatic reactions and restored him to his true freedom.\" Artaud is regarded as having viewed the body as an impermanent, composite image of actions inflicted upon a vulnerable and repressive physical structure; in a 1933 letter, he wrote that bodies should be understood only as \"provisional stratifications of states of life\". Deleuze reinterpreted the term in The Logic of Sense, inspired both by Artaud's text and the work of psychotherapist Gisela Pankow; here, he conceptualized the body without organs in the context of psychoanalysis, observing that the practice as it existed refused the thorough creation of BwOs. In Deleuze's early formulations of the concept, the body without organs was based in the symptoms related to schizophrenia, such as glossolalia where syllables are formlessly uttered and intoned in sets as if they were words. For Deleuze, glossolalia transforms words from having instrumental value, where words have literal meaning, to \"values which are exclusively tonic [relating to speech] and not written\", creating—in the case of language—lingual and verbal bodies without organs.    Usage   The concept of the body without organs was mainly defined by Deleuze and Guattari in the two volumes of their work Capitalism and Schizophrenia, Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus. In both books, the abstract body is defined as a self-regulating process—created by the relation between an abstract machine and a machinic assemblage—that maintains itself through processes of homeostasis and simultaneously limits the possible activities of its constituent parts, or organs. The body without organs is the sum total intensive and affective activity of the full potential for the body and its constituent parts. Deleuze and Guattari presume, in a continuation from Samuel Butler's radical departure from vitalism in \"Darwin among the Machines\", that since all organisms have some sort of abstract inclination or desire—in the case of nonhuman life such as plants and animals, their genetic instincts variably control what actions they take—the body without organs is the inevitable, unconstrained manifestation of those inclinations or desires that may take upon unprecedented forms. The concept of the body that the body without organs refers to inherits elements from both the concept of substance proposed by Baruch Spinoza and the concept of \"intensive magnitude\" in Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, wherein it is defined not by closed and determinate activity but by cohesion through affective potential. A body without organs can consist of many different actions that approach an unattainable goal, many of which are the activities of assemblages that people unconsciously create and are always engaged in; to become a body without organs, one must dispose of stratification (the classification of constituent parts into groups), and instead give way to what Deleuze and Guattari described as an immanent \"becoming\" of pure intensity. The body without organs is not necessarily coupled with the eradication of stratification, but rather encourages the creation of a \"smooth space\", immanently transforming the body beyond its existing categorization.

Twenty-five years later Fritz is a producer of alcoholic beverages, Ulrich is a stage actor and Johannes a teacher. When they look back at this biking tour the old friends are overcome by a feeling of nostalgia. They decide to take some time out together and relive the journey shared all those years ago. But things become complicated when Katinka, Fritz's future daughter-in-law,  confronts him because she's mad about his son Robby (played by Peter Kraus).

She is known for her involvement in the German '68-movement, along with her late sister, Jutta Winkelmann.    Life     Early years  Getty was born Gisela Martine Schmidt in 1949 in Kassel, West Germany. Her father, Julius Schmidt, was a writer and military historian. Her mother, born Ruth Winzenburg, was a teacher who left her job in an agricultural college to care for her family. Gisela attended the Waldorf school in Kassel with her sister Jutta. There, she studied graphic arts, fashion, film, and photography at the Kassel Arts Academy between 1966 and 1970. In 1968, the sisters partnered with Adolf Winkelmann and Gerhard Büttenbender to form the Kassel Film Collective. In 1969, they won first prize at the International Short Film Festival in Oberhausen. Their 31-minute film, Heinrich Viel, about a production line worker, was filmed in the Volkswagen factory in Baunatal. Also in 1969, Gisela Schmidt married Gerhard Büttenbender. Jutta married Adolf Winkelmann shortly afterward.    Berlin, Rome, and California  Gisela initially came to public attention during the 1968 student protests of the West German government. The years that followed, she was active in the demonstrations in Kassel and West Berlin. Getty's marriage with Büttenbender ended, and in 1970 she relocated to Berlin with Jutta. During this time, Getty and Jutta began friendships with actor Rolf Zacher and Rainer Langhans. Sources are inconsistent when a group including Jutta, Gisela, and Rolf Zacher moved to Rome. At around the same time, Gisela married Zacher. The marriage was brief, but it lasted long enough to produce a daughter, Anna, born towards the end of October 1972. the lifestyle that Gisela was leading in Rome was not conducive to safely bring up a new baby, and Anna was quickly sent to Kassel to be looked after by the family. During the early part of 1973, she met the teenager John Paul Getty who a few months later, still in Rome, became the victim of a very widely publicized 'Ndrangheta kidnapping. Getty had been expelled from his Rome-based international school the previous year, following the death of his stepmother, therefore becoming a teenage drop-out. Soon after he first set eyes on the twins the three of them became inseparable, living together in a shared basement apartment in Rome-Trastevere, sharing the bed as a threesome and \"convinced that we could achieve anything we wanted\". Nevertheless, as Gisela later told an interviewer, at that stage \"... there wasn’t more than holding hands\". Following the kidnapping, Gisela and Jutta fell under suspicion and were briefly detained by the authorities in Rome. By the time the kidnapping took place, during July 1973, the relationship with Getty had intensified. Following the child's release after five months (believed to have been in return for a large ransom payment from an enraged grandfather) Gisela Zacher and Paul Getty were in love. They married towards the end of 1974. Getty was disinherited by his grandfather who had some time previously stipulated that the boy should not marry before reaching the age of 22 or 23 (sources differ). Balthazar Getty, the young couple's son, was born towards the end of January 1975. Many aspects of the kidnapping incident remain unknown or undisclosed; however, media speculation has proliferated. By the time Balthazar was born, Gisela and her husband were in California, initially living together in Los Angeles and subsequently — in San Francisco. Gisela and Jutta had become media personalities through their involvement in the 1968 protests. The tragic events of 1973 and the marriage to Paul Getty greatly enhanced Gisela's media profile. By the time she left Rome for California she and her husband were part of a social network of arts-world celebrities that included Dennis Hopper, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Carlo Ponti and Federico Fellini. The kidnapping had inflicted levels of intense trauma on each of them that would remain with both. In California, Gisela was separated from her sister, but the \"wild child\" lifestyle continued in other respects. Sources relate how her husband found refuge but also dependency through intensification of his drug habit. There are reports that it was to get them away from the excesses of the lifestyle she and her husband shared, that Gisela eventually took the children away from their home together to live in a state of \"relative normality\" in San Francisco.

Plot  The film is a portrayal of an iconic Arab origin love tale Laila Majnu. It begins with Qais & Laila, who grow as a single soul from infancy. Their respective parents, Ameer Umri & Ameer Sarvaar, also share cordial relations. However, a rift arises between the families who are conscious of their progeny's fondness. Sarvaar rebuke Umri to restrain Qais. By not dissuading his daughter from seeing Qais, Sarvaar forcibly carries Laila to Mecca. Qais behind her and roams on the street in a lunatic state, uttering his darling's name. The public mocks him titling as Manju by casting the rocks. Laila & Manju are devastated just by a mere glance. So, Manju dares to intrude covetously but is caught and subjected to torment.  Meanwhile, the Iraq Emperor visits the town, who is startled by the knowledge of this love story. He covets Laila after noticing her and forces his acolyte, Anwar, to make it feasible. Besides, Umri implored Sarvaar to secure his son, which he accepted, stipulating that Manju be evidence that he was not insane. Though Manju triumphs in it, Sarvaar must bow his head down before the Empire's bridal connection. Ergo, the nuptial is conducted, Laila walks to Iraq with the Emperor, and Manju turns into a desert rover. The arrival of Laila irks the Emperor's mistress, Zarina, who harshly forwards but pacifies, mindful of her shattered story. Hence, she decides to aid her and pleads with the Emperor to quit her, which he denies. Now, the Emperor attempts to subdue Laila with utmost but in vain. Ultimately, he repents and honorably sends off Laila, adopting her as a sibling. At last, the catastrophe struck before them through a fierce sandstorm, but the estranged two united at hard-earned. Finally, the movie ends with Laila & Manju leaving their breath together, showing them as immortal.    Cast  Cast according to the opening credits of the film:  Nageswara Rao as Khayas (Majnu) Bhanumathi as Laila    Production  Laila Majnu, an ancient epic of love, is an integral part of classic Sufi literature. Hashmet Shah has told it, so has Amir Khusro. Nizami Ganjavi's 12th century version in scintillating verse filled with allegorical flourishes has been translated into numerous languages. Mian Mohammad Bakhsh's interpretation of the epic is held as an acclaimed treatise in Pakistan till this day. The tragic tale of Majnoon and Laila is said to have its foundations in true events that occurred in the 7th century. With his first film, Rathnamala, turning a box office hit, studio owner and director Ramakrishna was on the lookout for a suitable subject for Bharani's next venture. Fascinated by the first Hindi talkie version of Laila Majnu (1945), which he had seen in Bombay, he made the choice. His production chief D. L. Narayana agreed with him. A screening of the Hindi version was arranged for his actress-wife Bhanumathi and Akkineni Nageswara Rao, whom he had thought of for the protagonist's role. Samudrala Raghavacharya was assigned the job of writing the script and the dialogue. The sandstorm scene especially is worth mentioning. Instead of veteran cameraman Jiten Banerjee, who cranked for Rathnamala, Ramakrishna took B. S. Ranga as the cameraman without even knowing how efficient his work was. Ranga who bagged this assignment thanks to his brother Garudachari, a close friend of Ramakrishna, proved his worth and it was the turning point in his future life and career. Besides excellent photography, sound designing (by V. Srinivasa Raghavan under whom later day's popular director K.

As of 2013, Chandirani held the record of being the only film to be released in three languages on the same day (28 August 1953). Bhanumathi also became the first woman director to write and direct a film that achieved this feat. This is an alphabetical list of film articles (or sections within articles about films).

She was the mother of the actress Romy Schneider.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMagdalena Maria Schneider was born in Augsburg, Bavaria, the daughter of a plumber. She attended a Catholic girls' school and a commercial college; thereafter she worked as a stenographer in a grain store. At the same time, Schneider studied singing at the Leopold Mozart Conservatory in Augsburg and ballet at the municipal theater. She made her stage debut at the Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz in Munich. Schneider drew the attention of the Austrian director Ernst Marischka who called her to the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, and in 1930 gave Schneider her first film role.\n\nWhile filming in 1933, Schneider met her future husband, the Austrian actor Wolf Albach-Retty. The couple married in 1937 and had two children: Rosemarie Magdalena, called Romy, and Wolf-Dieter, later a surgeon, born in 1941. During World War II, Schneider lived in the Bavarian Alps near Hitler's retreat in the Obersalzberg above Berchtesgaden. Schneider was a guest of Hitler's, who declared that she was his favorite actress. Later she and Albach-Retty separated and the marriage ended in divorce in 1945.\nAfter the war, offers for movies initially were few. Schneider again began filming in 1948 and promoted her daughter's career with the joint appearance in the film When the White Lilacs Bloom Again (1953) directed by Hans Deppe, a typical 1950s Heimatfilm which was the film debut of her daughter, 14-year-old Romy Schneider. In the same year Magda Schneider married the Cologne restaurant owner Hans Herbert Blatzheim.\nMagda Schneider arranged further appearances with her daughter in several movies such as Mädchenjahre einer Königin (Victoria in Dover, 1954), the films of the Sissi trilogy based on the life of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, with Romy Schneider starring in the title role and Magda Schneider playing the role of her mother Princess Ludovika of Bavaria, and in Die Halbzarte (Eva, 1958). Magda Schneider's role in the 1933 film Liebelei (1933) was also played by her daughter, Romy Schneider, in the remake Christine (1958).\nSchneider died in 1996 at her house in Schönau near Berchtesgaden, Bavaria.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMagda Schneider at IMDb\nFilmography, photographs, literature (in German)\nMagda Schneider at Find a Grave\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Although it is fictional, loosely based on events in the life of James Jesus Angleton, it is advertised as telling the history of the birth of counterintelligence in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Edward Wilson (played by Damon), a senior CIA officer, discovers a mole in his department following the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. The film delves into Wilson's complex life, starting from his college years at Yale University in 1939, his initiation into the Skull and Bones fraternity, and his recruitment into intelligence work during World War II. His personal life is marked by a strained marriage to Margaret \"Clover\" Russell, played by Jolie, and a series of affairs that underscore the sacrifices and moral compromises inherent in espionage work. The narrative unfolds through a mix of present-day events and flashbacks, exploring the origins of the CIA, Wilson's involvement in key historical events, and the personal toll of a life dedicated to secrecy and intelligence. The film features an ensemble cast including Alec Baldwin, William Hurt, Joe Pesci, and John Turturro, among others. \"The Good Shepherd\" is a fictionalized account of the early days of the CIA, blending historical facts with dramatic elements to explore the complexity of intelligence work, and its impact on individual lives. The film was released on December 22, 2006, to mixed reviews. It grossed $100 million against an estimated $80 million production budget.    Plot  In 1961, the Bay of Pigs invasion ends disastrously. Senior CIA officer Edward Wilson is warned there are suspicions of a \"mole\" in his department. Returning home, he finds a photograph of a man and woman in bed, and audio tapes that have been tampered with, leaving certain details unclear. In a flashback to 1939, Wilson is attending Yale University, and is invited to join the Skull and Bones fraternity. During his initiation, he reveals that he discovered but never read the suicide note left by his father Thomas. He was an admiral who had been pegged to serve as Secretary of the Navy until his loyalties were questioned.  FBI agent Sam Murach recruits Wilson to investigate his poetry professor Frederick's ties as a Nazi sympathizer. Once exposed, Frederick resigns. Wilson begins dating Laura, a fellow Yale student who is deaf. After an announcement that World War II has begun in Europe, Laura asks Edward to sleep with her, but stops at the last moment. In 1940, Wilson attends a party and meets Margaret “Clover” Russell, sister of fellow Bonesman John. He is also introduced to General Bill Sullivan, who tells him the US will soon be compelled to enter the war and offers Edward a job in foreign intelligence. Clover, whose father is a Senator and head of the isolationist America First Committee, is attracted to Edward and he eventually succumbs to Clover's aggressive advances. While on a date with Laura at the beach, Edward is approached by John, who tells him Clover is pregnant and implies that Edward is obligated to marry her. Laura, reading their lips, walks away. On Edward and Clover's wedding day, he is presented with orders to leave for London.  In London, Edward is reunited with Dr. Fredericks, in reality a British intelligence operative who had recommended Edward for counter-espionage training. Special Operations Executive officer Arch Cummings informs Edward that Fredericks' indiscreet homosexual liaisons pose a security risk, as they make him susceptible to blackmail. Fredericks refuses an offer to retire quietly and is assassinated as a result. In post-war Berlin, Edward collaborates with Soviet counterpart \"Ulysses\" in the exchange of captured scientists. During a call home, his son Edward Jr. inadvertently reveals that Clover is having an affair. Edward impulsively sleeps with his office's interpreter Hanna Schiller, but discovers she is a Soviet operative. This results in her murder.  In 1946, Edward returns home and to Washington, DC to a distant Clover, who has resumed use of her birth name Margaret. The two each admit to having had affairs. She says that her brother John was killed in the war. Edward is again approached by General Sullivan, this time to help create the CIA with colleague Richard Hayes, with Phillip Allen as director. While Edward feels genuine affection for his son, Margaret grows increasingly disenchanted as he continually prioritizes work over family.  Valentin Mironov, a high-ranking KGB defector, presents information about \"Ulysses\" and warns Edward that he expects other men claiming to be him to seek asylum. While attending a play with Mironov, Edward encounters Laura after many years. They begin an affair, but end it after Margaret receives compromising photographs of them and publicly berates Edward. The year of 1942 in film involved some significant events, in particular the release of a film consistently rated as one of the greatest of all time, Casablanca.

ABC   With Fry in place as lead vocalist and lyricist, Vice Versa changed their name to ABC and changed their sound to a contemporary pop style that at that time led them to be categorised with bands like Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet and the Human League. Between 1982 and 1991, ABC recorded six studio albums (The Lexicon of Love, Beauty Stab, How to Be a ... Zillionaire!, Alphabet City, Up and Abracadabra) and released a greatest hits compilation album, Absolutely. During this time, the band went through numerous personnel changes, with Fry and Mark White being its only permanent members. Following the Zillionaire album, ABC temporarily fell from prominence while Fry was being treated for Hodgkin lymphoma, an uncommon cancer. In 1991, Mark White decided to retire from ABC. His departure was facilitated by a financial agreement, allowing him to leave the music industry and pursue personal interests, notably in Reiki therapy. This arrangement enabled ABC to continue its musical journey under the leadership of Martin Fry.  ABC released their seventh studio album Skyscraping, a homage to several of his musical heroes, including David Bowie, Roxy Music and the Sex Pistols. The album was a collaboration with Glenn Gregory of Heaven 17 and Honeyroot's Keith Lowndes. The band has toured extensively and performed live at events such as the 2001 Night of the Proms, where Fry was supported by a 72-piece orchestra and 50-piece choir. In 2008, Fry released a new ABC studio album titled Traffic. In April 2009, Fry and original drummer David Palmer performed The Lexicon of Love album live at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The band was accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra. Anne Dudley of Art of Noise fame, who arranged and played keyboards on the original record, conducted the Royal Albert Hall performance. Fry and Palmer (as ABC) toured the US as part of the 2009 'Regeneration Tour', which also featured Terri Nunn of Berlin, Wang Chung and the Cutting Crew. In April 2016, a single with a music video, \"Viva Love\" was released as a teaser for The Lexicon of Love II studio album. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 5, the band's highest chart position since 1982 and first top 10 entry since 1990.    Other work   Besides working with ABC, Fry has also recorded and toured with other artists.  In 1989, Fry recorded a song called \"Mythical Girl\" with Arthur Baker for Baker's album Merge, a project that included songs with various artists, including Love Is the Message featuring Al Green. Together with Mark White, Fry co-wrote and produced a couple of songs on Paul Rutherford's 1989 solo studio album Oh World, including the single \"Get Real\". In 1997, Fry contributed to David Arnold's Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project, an album made up of re-recordings of James Bond movie themes featuring vocals by contemporary artists. The song Fry performed was the theme of Thunderball In 2005, Fry embarked on an extensive UK tour with Tony Hadley, former lead vocalist of popular 1980s new wave band Spandau Ballet. Highlights of the tour were released on CD and DVD compilations, both titled Tony Hadley vs. Martin Fry. Fry appeared in the BBC Television program Just the Two of Us in 2006. Valentín Carboni (born 5 March 2005) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for  Ligue 1 club Marseille, on loan from Serie A club Inter Milan, and the Argentina national team.    Club career     Early years  Born in Buenos Aires, in his early childhood Carboni played futsal at the grassroots team Club Lafuente in Lanús; in 2013, aged eight, he started playing football by joining the youth academy of Lanús. In July 2019, Carboni joined the youth sector of Italian side Catania, together with his older brother Franco and his father Ezequiel, who had just taken on a double role as youth coach and head of youth development at the club.    Inter Milan  One year later, after having attracted the interest of several high-profile European clubs, the midfielder and his brother both joined Serie A club Inter Milan, for an estimated €300,000 transfer fee. Carboni quickly came through the Nerazzurri's youth ranks, establishing himself as part of the under-19 squad since the start of the 2021–22 season, and helping the aforementioned team win the under-19 national championship in 2022. At the start of the 2022–23 campaign, while keeping featuring for the Primavera squad in the national league and in the UEFA Youth League, Carboni started training with Inter Milan's first team under head coach Simone Inzaghi. The midfielder subsequently made his professional debut on 1 October 2022, at 17 years and 206 days, coming on as a substitute for Federico Dimarco in the 88th minute of a 2–1 league loss against Roma. Then, on 1 November, he made his UEFA Champions League debut, replacing Joaquín Correa in the 76th minute of a 2–0 group stage loss against Bayern Munich. In July 2023, Carboni signed a new long-term contract with Inter Milan.    Loan to Monza  On 15 July 2023, Carboni officially joined fellow Serie A club Monza on a season-long loan. On 1 December, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 home league defeat to Juventus.

Argentina youth  In March 2022, he switched allegiance to Argentina and received his first official call-up to the Argentine senior national team, having been included in the preliminary list for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification matches against Venezuela and Ecuador. In May 2022, he was included by head coach Javier Mascherano in the Argentine under-20 squad that took part in the Maurice Revello Tournament in France, as the Albiceleste eventually finished in fifth place, after winning the play-off match against Japan. In October 2022, he was included by head coach Lionel Scaloni in Argentina's preliminary squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, although he did not make the cut to the final 26-men list. In March 2023, he was called up again to the Argentina senior national team for two friendly matches against Panama and Curaçao. In May of the same year, he was included in the final squad for the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Argentina. On the debut on 20 May he scored his first goal in a 2–1 victory against Uzbekistan.

It was the ninth film featuring Conway as The Falcon. After the following film,\" The Falcon's Adventure\", the series was ended due to declining popularity. Czech cinema comprises the cinema of Czech Republic as well as cinema while this country was a part of other countries. The Fabulous World of Jules Verne is considered the most internationally successful Czech film ever made; soon after its release it was distributed to 72 countries and received widespread attention. Domestically, the most viewed Czech film ever is The Proud Princess from 1952, which was seen by 8,222,695 people. Marketa Lazarová was voted the all-time best Czech movie in a 1998 poll of Czech film critics and publicists.    History  The first Czech film director and cinematographer was Jan Kříženecký, who started filming short documentaries in Prague in the second half of 1898. The first permanent cinema house was founded by Viktor Ponrepo in 1907 in Prague.    Interwar period  Among the prominent directors were Karel Lamač, Karl Anton, Svatopluk Innemann, Přemysl Pražský, Martin Frič and Gustav Machatý. The first Czechoslovak film fully made with synchronized sound is considered to be Když struny lkají, released in September 1930. Tonka of the Gallows, released in February 1930, was shot as a silent film and the sound was added in France. Barrandov Studios was launched by Miloš Havel in 1933, which started a Czech film industry film boom. It is the largest film studio in the country and one of the larger in Europe.    World War II  During World War II, many major pre-war film directors continued to make films, including Otakar Vávra, Martin Frič, Miroslav Cikán, Jan Sviták (who was murdered at the end of the war by an anti-fascist mob), Vladimír Slavínský, František Čáp, Zdeněk Gina Hašler (who emigrated to the USA after the war) and Václav Binovec. Vladimír Čech and Václav Krška started their careers during World War II. Scenario writer Karel Steklý turned to film directing at the end of the war and maintained both careers until his death. Well-known actor Rudolf Hrušínský (born 1920) also directed films during this period.    After World War II  Many prominent people of Czech cinema left the country before World War II including directors Karel Lamač and Gustav Machatý, cinematographer Otto Heller, actors Hugo Haas and Jiří Voskovec and producer Josef Auerbach. Director Vladislav Vančura was murdered by Nazis as were popular actor and signer Karel Hašler, actress Anna Letenská and writer Karel Poláček. Studio owner Miloš Havel and actresses Lída Baarová and Adina Mandlová went into exile in Germany or Austria after they were accused of collaborating with Nazis during the war. In 1943, Czech Film Archive (NFA) was established in Prague. In 1945, the Czechoslovak film industry was nationalized. The Proud Princess, the most viewed Czech film ever, was released in 1952. It was seen by 8,222,695 people. The film also won a prize for a child film at Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. Famous movies of the 1950s include Journey to the Beginning of Time, The Good Soldier Švejk, The Emperor and the Golem, The Princess with the Golden Star, The Fabulous World of Jules Verne, Proud Princess (the most viewed Czech film ever) and Once Upon a Time, There Was a King....    New Wave   The Czechoslovak New Wave frequently is associated with the early works of directors such as Miloš Forman, Věra Chytilová, Jiří Menzel and others, but works by older, established Czechoslovak directors such as Karel Kachyňa and Vojtěch Jasný are placed in this category. Encompassing a broad range of works in the early to mid-1960s, the Czechoslovak New Wave cannot be categorized to any one style or approach to filmmaking. Examples range from highly stylised, even avant-garde, literary adaptions using historical themes (e.g. Jan Němec's Diamonds of the Night (Démanty noci)) to semi-improvised comedies with contemporary subjects and amateur actors (e.g., Miloš Forman's The Firemen's Ball (Hoří, má panenko)). However, a frequent feature of films from this period was absurd, black humour and an interest in the concerns of ordinary people, particularly when faced with larger historical or political changes. The Falcon's Adventure is a 1946 film which was the 13th of sixteen films about The Falcon and the final film of RKO's Falcon series starring Tom Conway. It was directed by William Berke, who had served as producer for the previous entry in the series, 1946's\" The Falcon's Alibi\". Martin Frič( 29 March 1902 – 26 August 1968) was a Czech film director, screenwriter and actor. He had more than 100 directing credits between 1929 and 1968, including feature films, shorts and documentary films. Throughout his life, Frič struggled with alcoholism. On the day of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, he attempted suicide, after battling cancer. He died in the hospital five days later. == Filmography == The Falcon is the nickname for two fictional detectives. Drexel Drake (real name Charles H. Huff) created Michael Waring, alias the Falcon, a freelance investigator and troubleshooter, in his 1936 novel, The Falcon's Prey. It was followed by two more novels – The Falcon Cuts In, 1937, and The Falcon Meets a Lady, 1938 – and a 1938 short story. Michael Arlen created Gay Stanhope Falcon in 1940. This Falcon made his first appearance in Arlen's short story \"Gay Falcon\" (aka \"A Man Called Falcon\"), which was originally published in 1940 in Town & Country magazine. The story opens with the words \"Now of this man who called himself Gay Falcon many tales are told, and this is one of them.\" Arlen's Falcon is characterized as a freelance adventurer and troubleshooter – a man who makes his living \"keeping his mouth shut and engaging in dangerous enterprises.\"    Film appearances   Arlen's Falcon was quickly brought to the screen by RKO Radio Pictures. The 1941 film The Gay Falcon redefined the character as a suave English gentleman detective with a weakness for beautiful women. Though Gay Falcon was the character's name in Arlen's original story, the character was renamed Gay Laurence for the film. (The surname was spelled \"Lawrence\" in subsequent films.) Thus \"The Falcon\" became an alias or nickname, à la \"The Saint.\" In later outings, in various media, the character had a variety of \"real names,\" still being known as The Falcon. Neither in films nor on radio was the nickname ever explained.  The Gay Falcon was intended to establish a replacement character for Leslie Charteris's The Saint (Simon Templar), who had appeared in a popular RKO film series. To that end, George Sanders, star of The Saint series, was cast in the Falcon role, with \"Saint\" love interest Wendy Barrie continuing opposite Sanders. In the Falcon movies, as in the Leslie Charteris \"Saint\" novels of the period, the hero is almost always accompanied in his travels by a wisecracking sidekick, portrayed variously by Allen Jenkins (in the first three Falcon films), Don Barclay, Cliff Edwards, Edward Brophy, and Vince Barnett.  The new Falcon films followed the \"Saint\" pattern so closely that author Charteris sued RKO, charging unfair competition. Charteris told author David Zinman in 1971, \"RKO switched to The Falcon, a flagrant carbon copy of their version of The Saint, in my opinion with the single mercenary motive of saving the payments they had to make to me for the film rights.\" Charteris actually pokes fun at The Falcon in his 1943 novel The Saint Steps In, with a character making a metafictional reference to the Falcon being \"a bargain-basement imitation\" of The Saint. George Sanders appeared in the first four Falcon features. When Sanders tired of B leads, he bowed out of the series in The Falcon's Brother (1942). In the film, Gay Lawrence is killed by assassins, prompting his brother Tom, played by Sanders's actual older brother, Tom Conway, to become the new Falcon. Producer Maurice Geraghty later revealed that RKO executives had recruited Conway simply as a way to induce Sanders to make one more Falcon picture, after which the series would end. \"So it was astonishing to them when Tom Conway caught on right away and carried the series on – even outgrossing the pictures George had made.\" After The Falcon's Brother, Conway starred in nine more Falcon films through 1946.  As with other series of B mystery films, the plot of a Falcon movie generally revolved around a particular locale that the detective was visiting. An oft-used gimmick in the Falcon series was to tack \"teaser\" epilogues onto the ends of films. In each teaser, a previously unseen woman would approach the Falcon, usually in desperation, and signal the title and locale of his next movie. A teaser rarely had anything to do with the plot of the upcoming film, since that film had not yet been produced.  The Falcon was revived for three more films, all made in 1948, but these featured the earlier \"Michael Waring\" character as created by Drexel Drake. However, he was referred to as \"Watling\" and the credits still claimed he was based on a character created by Michael Arlen.  Actor-magician John Calvert played \"The New Falcon\" in three low-budget features produced by Film Classics. Vatroslav is a Croatian masculine given name. It derives from word for \"fire\" (vatra) and the Slavic language suffix -slav, meaning \"glory\" or \"fame\". The feminine version is Vatroslava.\n\n\n== People named Vatroslav ==\nVatroslav Jagić (1838–1923), Croatian linguist\nVatroslav Lichtenegger (1809–1885), Austrian-Croatian music educator\nVatroslav Lisinski (1819–1854), Croatian composer\nVatroslav Mihačić (born 1967), retired Croatian footballer\nVatroslav Mimica (1923–2020), Croatian film director\nVatroslav Petrinović (born 1959), retired Croatian footballer\n\n\n== See also ==\nSlavic names The Maltese Falcon is a 1941 American film noir in which a San Francisco private detective deals with three unscrupulous adventurers, all seeking a jewel-encrusted falcon statuette. Written and directed by John Huston in his directorial debut, the film was based on the 1930 novel The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett and is a remake of the 1931 film of the same name. It stars Humphrey Bogart as private investigator Sam Spade, Mary Astor as his femme fatale client, and as villains Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. The film premiered in New York City on 3 October 1941, and was an immediate success, eventually becoming one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress to be included in the National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".    Plot   In San Francisco, private investigators Sam Spade and Miles Archer meet prospective client Ruth Wonderly. She claims to be looking for her missing sister, who ran off from their home in New York and came to the city with a man named Floyd Thursby. Archer agrees to help get her sister back. However, later that night, the police inform Spade that Archer has been killed. Spade tries calling his client at her hotel to discover she has checked out. Back at his apartment, he is grilled by Police Detective Tom Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy, who tell him that Thursby was murdered the same evening. Dundy suggests that Spade had the opportunity and motive to kill Thursby, who likely killed Archer. Later that morning, Spade meets Wonderly, now calling herself Brigid O'Shaughnessy, who confesses that her story was made up. However, she convinces Spade to investigate the murders and also reveals that Thursby was her partner. He took advantage of her and probably killed Archer, but she claims to have no idea who killed Thursby. At his office, Spade meets Joel Cairo, who first offers him $5,000 to find a \"black figure of a bird\". When Spade is skeptical, Cairo pulls a gun on him and searches the room for it. Spade knocks Cairo out and goes through his belongings. When Cairo comes round, he hires Spade.  On his way to visit O'Shaughnessy later that evening, Spade is followed by a young man but manages to evade him. When he tells O'Shaughnessy about Cairo, her nervousness indicates she knows him. He arranges a meeting between the two at his apartment, where Cairo becomes agitated when O'Shaughnessy reveals that the \"Fat Man\" is in San Francisco. When Spade goes to Cairo's hotel in the morning, he spots Wilmer Cook, the young man who trailed him earlier. Wilmer works for Kasper Gutman, the \"Fat Man\". In his hotel suite, Gutman relates the history of the Maltese Falcon, then offers Spade his pick of $25,000 for the bird and another $25,000 after its sale, or a quarter of the proceeds from its sale. Spade passes out because his drink is spiked. Wilmer and Cairo come in from another room and leave with Gutman. On coming round, Spade searches the suite and finds a newspaper with the arrival time of the freighter La Paloma circled. He goes to the dock, only to find the ship on fire. Later, the ship's captain Jacoby is shot several times and staggers into Spade's office before dying. The bundle he was clutching contains the Maltese Falcon. O'Shaughnessy calls the office, gives an address, then screams before the line goes dead. Spade stashes the package at the bus terminal, then goes to the address, which turns out to be an empty lot. Spade returns home to discover O'Shaughnessy hiding in a doorway. He takes her inside and finds Gutman, Cairo, and Wilmer waiting for him, guns drawn. Gutman gives Spade $10,000 for the Falcon, but Spade tells them that part of his price is someone he can turn over to the police for the murders of Thursby and Captain Jacoby, suggesting Wilmer. After some intense negotiation, Gutman and Cairo agree and Wilmer is knocked out and disarmed. Just after dawn, Spade calls his secretary, Effie Perine, to bring him the bundle. However, when Gutman inspects the statuette, he finds it is a fake and Wilmer escapes during the tumult. Recovering his composure, Gutman invites Cairo to return with him to Istanbul to continue their quest. After they leave, Spade calls the police and tells them where to pick up the pair.

The Peanut Butter Falcon is a 2019 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, in their directorial film debut, and starring Zack Gottsagen, Shia LaBeouf, Dakota Johnson and John Hawkes. The plot follows a young man with Down syndrome who escapes from an assisted living facility and befriends a wayward fisherman on the run. As the two men form a rapid bond, a social worker attempts to track them. Filming took place in North Carolina and Georgia. The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 9, 2019, and was given a limited theatrical release in the United States on August 9, 2019, by Roadside Attractions. The film went on to become a sleeper hit, grossing over $23 million, making it the highest grossing independent film of the year, and received praise from critics.    Plot  Zak, a young man with Down syndrome, escapes from a state-run care facility with the help of his elderly roommate, to train as a professional wrestler under the tutelage of his hero, the Salt Water Redneck. Meanwhile, Tyler, a man fired for bringing in illegal crab catches, decides to burn the gear of his rivals, Duncan and Ratboy, and flees himself. While on the run, Zak and Tyler meet, and embark on a journey to the Salt Water Redneck's wrestling school in North Carolina. Zak's caretaker at the nursing home, Eleanor, sets out to find Zak and return him safely to the facility. Zak and Tyler become friends while travelling. Tyler teaches Zak various life skills, including how to use a shotgun, and eventually takes on the role of his coach, getting him in shape for his wrestling endeavors. They build a raft and begin traveling by water. Eleanor soon finds them, but after learning her boss intends to send Zak to a more severe form of confinement, joins them to travel south. That night, Duncan and Ratboy catch up with the trio, and Zak defends them with the shotgun. When they reach Ayden, North Carolina, Tyler learns that the Salt Water Redneck has retired and closed the school, but convinces him to resurrect his alter ego for Zak. Salt Water trains Zak as a wrestler, and quickly puts Zak on a local fight card, which he believes he has rigged for Zak's safety and success. However, when the fight happens, Zak's opponent, Sam, does not hold back, and proceeds to beat him. As Tyler attempts to intervene, Duncan and Ratboy arrive, and Duncan hits Tyler on the head with a tire iron, knocking him unconscious right as Zak manages to lift Sam overhead and throw him forcefully out of the ring, something Salt Water had told him was impossible. The film ends with Tyler healing from the injury, as Eleanor drives him and Zak to Florida, implying the start of a new life for the three of them as a family.    Cast  Shia LaBeouf as Tyler Dakota Johnson as Eleanor John Hawkes as Duncan Bruce Dern as Carl Zack Gottsagen as Zak Rob Thomas as Winkie Jon Bernthal as Mark Thomas Haden Church as Clint / The Salt Water Redneck Yelawolf as Ratboy Jake Roberts as Sam Mick Foley as Jacob Wayne Dehart as Jasper John Dylan Odom as Wrestler (uncredited)    Production  The film is a modern retelling of the Huckleberry Finn story, which takes Gottsagen's own desire to be an actor and changes it into a quest to become a wrestler. Nilson and Schwartz met Gottsagen at a camp for actors with disabilities around 2011 in Venice, California, and he expressed interest in them making a film with him. After shooting a $20,000 proof-of-concept video, with producer David Thies, the duo received funding for the film to star Gottsagen. Shia LaBeouf, Dakota Johnson and Bruce Dern joined the cast for the film in June 2017. In July 2017, production began in Georgia. Later that month, John Hawkes, Jon Bernthal, Thomas Haden Church, Mick Foley, Jake Roberts and Yelawolf joined the cast of the film.    Music  Schwartz and Nilson wanted to play the music that inspired them while writing, and on set used a boombox to play the same music before performing a scene. The soundtrack brings together bluegrass, folk songs, and spirituals, for a mix of contemporary and timeless. The soundtrack contains original music composed by Zach Dawes, Jonathan Sadoff of Thenewno2, and Noam Pikelny and Gabe Witcher of Punch Brothers, as well as new and classic songs from Sara Watkins, Chance McCoy of Old Crow Medicine Show, Gregory Alan Isakov, Ola Belle Reed, and the Staple Singers.

The Santa Clara Vanguard is one of the thirteen founding member corps of Drum Corps International (DCI) and a seven time DCI World Champion, winning the title most recently in 2018.    History  In March 1967, citing differences of opinion in the artistic direction of the Sparks Drum and Bugle Corps, its parents support group voted to return the corps to its former activity as a drum and lyre corps with majorettes. After the vote, three adults took members aside and asked them if they would prefer to continue as a drum and bugle corps or to return to a drum and lyre corps. After the members chose a drum and bugle corps, their parents immediately started a new booster club to support the new corps. They waited until its members met for rehearsal the following week to select a name. After discussing and rejecting several possible names, the corps chose Santa Clara Vanguard. Gail Royer, a local elementary school music teacher and instructor for the Sparks, was named as the director for the new corps. In 1968, the corps embarked on its first tour to the Midwest. Although they did not place high at any of the competitions, the tour was a success because of the experience and exposure to the national drum corps scene. The corps also won its first field show that year in August 1968, at the Anaheim Kingsmen's Festival of Music. Santa Clara Vanguard capped off its year by winning the first of many California State Open Championships. In 1971, the Blue Stars, Cavaliers, Madison Scouts, Santa Clara Vanguard, and the Troopers formed the Midwest Combine. This action was taken in reaction to the rigid rules of the American Legion and VFW and the low or nonexistent performance fees paid for appearing in the various competitions. The corps felt that not only were they having their creative potential as artistic performing groups stifled, but they were being financially starved. A similar group of eastern corps, the United Organization of Junior Corps (also known as the \"Alliance\"), was formed by the 27th Lancers, Garfield Cadets, Boston Crusaders, Blessed Sacrament Golden Knights, and Blue Rock. The Combine members felt that the corps should be making their own rules, operating their own competitions and championships, and keeping the bulk of the proceeds that those shows earned. For the 1971 season, the corps stuck together, offering show promoters the five corps as a package. Despite pressure on show sponsors, judges, and other drum corps, the Combine was a success. In 1972, the Santa Clara Vanguard, along with the nine other corps from the Midwest Combine and the Alliance, plus the Anaheim Kingsmen, Argonne Rebels, and De La Salle Oaklands were the founding members of Drum Corps International. At the first DCI World Championships in Whitewater, Wisconsin, Santa Clara Vanguard finished in third place.  Santa Clara would remain among DCI's top three corps for the organization's first eight years, winning the World Championships in 1973, 1974, 1978. Santa Clara Vanguard won its fourth DCI World Championship in 1981. Over the next seven years, Santa Clara Vanguard never placed below third before winning its fifth DCI title in 1989.  They won their sixth DCI World Championship in 1999 and their seventh in 2018.  Since Drum Corps International's founding in 1972, Santa Clara Vanguard had been the only corps to appear as a finalist in every World Championship, until in December 2022, Vanguard Music & Performing Arts announced that the Santa Clara Vanguard Drum & Bugle Corps would be placed on hiatus for the 2023 season due to multiple financial issues from the previous season. On September 8, 2023, Santa Clara Vanguard confirmed their plans to return for the 2024 season, alongside the announcement of their management team, design team, and their new CEO, Dr. Russell Gavin.

Jean Arthur (born Gladys Georgianna Greene; October 17, 1900 – June 19, 1991) was an American Broadway and film actress whose career began in silent films in the early 1920s and lasted until the early 1950s. Arthur had feature roles in three Frank Capra films: Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) with Gary Cooper, You Can't Take It with You (1938) co-starring James Stewart, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), also starring Stewart. These three films all championed the \"everyday heroine\", personified by Arthur. She also co-starred with Cary Grant in the adventure-drama Only Angels Have Wings (1939) and in the comedy-drama The Talk of the Town (1942). She starred as the lead in the acclaimed and highly successful comedy films The Devil and Miss Jones (1941) and A Foreign Affair (1948), the latter of which she starred alongside Marlene Dietrich. Arthur was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1944 for her performance in The More the Merrier (1943), a comedy which also starred Joel McCrea. James Harvey wrote in his history of the romantic comedy: \"No one was more closely identified with the screwball comedy than Jean Arthur. So much was she part of it, so much was her star personality defined by it, that the screwball style itself seems almost unimaginable without her.\" She has been called \"the quintessential comedic leading lady\". Her last film performance was non-comedic, playing the homesteader's wife in George Stevens's Shane in 1953. Like Greta Garbo, Arthur was well known in Hollywood for her aversion to publicity; she rarely signed autographs or granted interviews. Life observed in a 1940 article: \"Next to Garbo, Jean Arthur is Hollywood's reigning mystery woman.\" As well as recoiling from interviews, after a certain age, she avoided photographers and refused to become a part of any kind of publicity.    Early life  Arthur was born Gladys Georgianna Greene in Plattsburgh, New York, to Protestant parents, Johanna Augusta Nelson and Hubert Sidney Greene. Gladys' Lutheran maternal grandparents immigrated from Norway to the American West after the Civil War. Her Congregationalist paternal ancestors immigrated from England to Rhode Island in the second half of the 1600s. During the 1790s, Nathaniel Greene helped found the town of St. Albans, Vermont, where his great-grandson, Hubert Greene, was born. Johanna and Hubert were married in Billings, Montana, on July 7, 1890. Gladys's three older brothers—Donald Hubert Greene, Robert Brazier Greene, and Albert Sidney Greene—were born in the West.  Around 1897, Hubert moved his wife and three sons from Billings to Plattsburgh, so he could work as a photographer at the Woodward Studios on Clinton Street. Johanna gave birth to stillborn twins on April 1, 1898. Two and a half years later, Johanna gave birth to Gladys. The product of a nomadic childhood, the future Jean Arthur lived at times in Saranac Lake, New York; Jacksonville, Florida, where George Woodward, Hubert's Plattsburgh employer, opened a second studio; and Schenectady, New York, where Hubert had grown up and where several members of his family still lived. The Greenes lived on and off in Westbrook, Maine, from 1908 to 1915, while Gladys's father worked at Lamson Studios in Portland. Relocating in 1915 to New York City, the family settled in the Washington Heights neighborhood – at 573 West 159th Street – of upper Manhattan, and Hubert worked at Ira L. Hill's photographic studio on Fifth Avenue. Gladys dropped out of high school in her junior year due to a \"change in family circumstances\". Presaging many of her later film roles, she worked as a stenographer on Bond Street in lower Manhattan during and after World War I. Both her father (at age 55, claiming to be 45) and siblings registered for the draft. Her brother Albert died in 1926 as a result of respiratory injuries suffered during a mustard gas attack during World War I.    Career     Silent film   Discovered by Fox Film Studios while she was doing commercial modeling in New York City in the early 1920s, the newly named Jean Arthur landed a one-year contract and debuted in the silent film Cameo Kirby (1923), directed by John Ford. She reputedly took her stage name from two of her greatest heroes, Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc) and King Arthur. The studio was at the time looking for new American sweethearts with sufficient sex appeal to interest the Jazz Age audiences. The Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball team represents Santa Clara University in NCAA Division I basketball competition. The team plays home games at the Leavey Center in Santa Clara, California and have been members of the West Coast Conference since its formation in 1952. The team is currently coached by Herb Sendek, who had previously been the head coach at NC State and Arizona State. Sendek was hired on March 29, 2016. Santa Clara has a long history of basketball success, having appeared in 11 NCAA Tournaments and six National Invitational Tournaments and producing a number of both collegiate All-Americans and NBA players. The 2010–11 team won the 2011 CollegeInsider.com Tournament, and the 2012–13 team won the 2013 College Basketball Invitational. They are the only team to have won a CBI and a CIT. More recently, the Broncos have returned to the NIT in both 2022 and 2023, and in each season produced a first round draft pick in the NBA draft.    History  Basketball made its inauspicious debut at Santa Clara in 1904 with a 9–7 victory over Alameda High School. Later that year, Santa Clara played its first intercollegiate game, a loss to the University of the Pacific, then located just down the road from Santa Clara. Early schedules composed of high school and YMCA opponents gave way to wholly intercollegiate schedules, and by 1916, the Broncos were matching up with teams like Stanford, USC, and Nevada, in addition to traditional arch-rivals San Francisco and St. Mary's. Santa Clara has long had a series of long-tenured coaches; since 1935, only seven different men have coached the Broncos. The first long-tenured coach of Santa Clara was Harlan Dykes, who led the team to a 101–48 record. Much like the university football team, the Broncos played many home games in San Francisco, both at Kezar Pavilion and at the Civic Center.  More sustained success for Santa Clara came under Head Coach George Barsi, whose tenure spanned from 1935 to 1945. Barsi was a graduate of Santa Clara in 1930. Barsi's \"Magicians of the Maplewood\" included future Warriors Head Coach Bob Feerick as well as Santa Clara's first All-American, Ralph \"Toddy\" Giannini. The Broncos dazzled crowds in excess of 20,000 at Madison Square Garden and defeated City College of New York and La Salle University by 20 points apiece during an exhibition match-up. Santa Clara was among the first teams to shoot one-handed or run the fast break. Some of Santa Clara's earliest basketball stars, like Bruce Hale, Dick O'Keefe, and Stan Patrick, played in the NBL, the forerunner to the modern NBA. Following the post-war period, former Santa Clara star Bob Feerick returned to coach the Broncos. Under his guidance, the Broncos advanced to the 1952 Final Four, as well as Elite Eight trips in 1953 and 1954. Santa Clara forward Ken Sears appeared on the cover of the new Sports Illustrated in December 1954, becoming the first basketball player, college or pro, to do so. After leading the Broncos back to the NCAA tournament in 1960, Feerick left Santa Clara in 1962 to coach the NBA's San Francisco Warriors, who had just relocated from Philadelphia.  Replacing Feerick was Dick Garibaldi, a member of the 1952 Final Four team, who led the Broncos for eight seasons and compiled an overall record of 137–77 (.640). His 1968 squad finished at 27–2, dropping only one regular season game, to local rival San Jose State. Led on the court  by Bud Ogden and Dennis Awtrey, Santa Clara reached as high as second in the AP poll. The Broncos also appeared in the NCAA tournament in 1967 and 1969. In a three-year period, they compiled a 73–12 (.859) record. Garibaldi resigned in the summer of 1970 to work for Converse shoes, and Carroll Williams became the longest tenured coach in Santa Clara's basketball history, leading the Broncos from 1970 to 1991. He led the team to a 344–274 (.557) record. Despite the sustained success, Williams took the Broncos to an NCAA tournament only once (1987); in addition, the team reached the NIT in 1984, 1985, and 1989. Williams' tenure produced two of Santa Clara's most memorable players, Kurt Rambis and Nick Vanos, the former remembered for his time with the Lakers and the latter remembered for his untimely death shortly after entering the NBA. This is the filmography of Jean Arthur (October 17, 1900 – June 19, 1991), including her television work.\n\n\n== References == Richard A.

The similarity between RKO's The Ex-Mrs. Bradford and M-G-M's The Thin Man (1934) was speculated about given the chances that RKO's film would eclipse After the Thin Man (1936), which was to be released later in the year, at the box office. Modern sources claim that the film was RKO's third most successful production of 1936.    Plot  Wealthy murder mystery writer Paula Bradford (Jean Arthur) returns from her worldwide travels to see her former husband, surgeon Dr. Lawrence \"Brad\" Bradford (William Powell). He had divorced her because she was always involving him in real-life murder cases, but she wants him back. When a jockey riding the favorite dies while leading a race, she is convinced it was murder. She and Mike North (Frank M. Thomas), the horse's trainer, persuade the reluctant doctor to investigate. Brad is puzzled when he finds traces of gelatin on the corpse. Then he receives an envelope at home addressed to North. North telephones a little later to say he sent it and will come pick it up. Someone claiming to be North calls shortly afterward and instructs Brad to meet him somewhere else, but without the money. Curious, Brad opens the envelope to find a great deal of money and replaces it with some torn up magazine pieces. Suspicious, Brad takes a taxi, but gets out a short distance away and returns to his suite. As he anticipated, a burglar is inside looking for the envelope. When the two men start fighting, Paula tries to help using a skull she picks up, but ends up knocking out Brad instead, allowing the intruder to get away. Soon after, the doorbell rings. When Brad opens the door, North's body falls in. Police Inspector Corrigan (James Gleason) names Brad as the main suspect in the second death. Now Brad has to solve both murders to clear himself. All sorts of suspects present themselves: Nick Martel (Robert Armstrong), a bookie who owed North $125,000 for a winning bet; Leroy Hutchins (Ralph Morgan), the owner of the winning horse; John Summers (Grant Mitchell), the favorite's owner; Mrs. Summers, who is seeing Martel behind her husband's back; and Summer's lawyer, Henry Strand (an uncredited Frank Reicher). Even Brad's receptionist, Miss Prentiss (Lila Lee), had been spotted with Martel. Brad discovers that North made the bet through someone else and Martel was instructed to send the money to an address he was given, but decided to confront North in person instead over what he considered to be deceit; though North claimed he did not place the bet, Martel did not believe him and gave him the money. Going to the address provided, Brad finds Paula already there. They then discover the body of Lou Pender (Paul Fix), the would-be burglar who had masqueraded as North, in a Murphy bed after he kills a spider. As Brad is examining the corpse, an unseen person shoots at him from the window. He is not seriously wounded. Brad eventually figures out how the murders were committed. The killer put a deadly black widow spider inside a gelatin capsule, secretly attached it to the victim's body, and waited for the gelatin to melt from body heat, releasing the spider. Since the police have the $125,000, Brad assumes the killer will try the same trick again. The same two horses are scheduled to race against each other the next day, so Brad has film cameras set up around the racetrack. The murderer does strike again, but Brad had taken the precaution of inoculating the jockey beforehand. Brad invites all of the suspects to his suite, hoping the culprit will stay away. When that fails, he screens the film footage he had taken. It shows Mr. Summers slipping a capsule down the jockey's back.  Pulling out a gun, Summers admits his motive was revenge against his unfaithful wife and Martel. Brad subdues him before he can shoot the lovers. During the struggle, however, Paula accidentally knocks out her ex-husband with a vase. Despite this, the couple remarry.

It drains parts of four ranges in the Transverse Ranges System north and northwest of Los Angeles, then flows west onto the Oxnard Plain and into the Santa Barbara Channel of the Pacific Ocean. The watershed has provided habitat for a wide array of native plants and animals and has historically supplied humans with water, fish, and fertile farmland. The northern portion of the watershed was home to the Tataviam people while the southern portion was occupied by the Chumash people. Much of the Santa Clara River Valley is used for agriculture which has limited the use of structural levees to separate the natural floodplain from the river. Although it is one of the least altered rivers in Southern California, some levees exist where the river flows through areas of significant urban development.    History  The Santa Clara River was originally named the Río de Santa Clara on August 9, 1769, by the Portolá expedition on the march north from San Diego to found a mission at Monterey, to honor Saint Clare of Assisi who died on August 11, 1253. The Santa Clara River Valley was then known as the Cañada de Santa Clara. The Santa Clara-Mojave River Ranger District of the Angeles National Forest is named after the Santa Clara River.    Floods   The failure and near complete collapse of the St. Francis Dam took place in the middle of the night on March 12, 1928. The dam was holding a full reservoir of 12.4×109 US gal (4.7×1010 L) of water that surged down San Francisquito Canyon and emptied into the river.    Course   The Santa Clara River's headwaters take drainage from the northern slopes of the San Gabriel Mountains near the Angeles Forest Highway, inside the western part of the Angeles National Forest. Its largest fork, Aliso Canyon, is about 7 mi (11 km) long and forms the primary headstream. These branches combine into the broad wash of the main stem near the town of Acton which flows west through Soledad Canyon, crossing under California State Route 14 near the town of Canyon Country. The Sierra Pelona Mountains on the north provide additional watershed and seasonal tributaries. The river receives Bouquet Creek, Placerita Creek, and San Francisquito Creek within the City of Santa Clarita. The riverbed surface remains dry most of the year here, except on extreme occasions of heavier than average rainfall. The river then crosses west under Interstate 5 and receives Castaic Creek from the right. After the Castaic Creek confluence, the river starts to flow primarily southwest through the Santa Clarita Valley. Near the county line between Los Angeles County and Ventura County, the river enters the Santa Clara River Valley flowing past Buckhorn and Fillmore, incorporating additional flow from Piru Creek and Sespe Creek, both from the right, and Santa Paula Creek at the town of Santa Paula, where it passes the large South Mountain Oil Field on the south bank.  The Santa Clara River then bends southwest, passing the Saticoy Oil Field on the north bank where South Mountain marks its entrance onto the broad Oxnard Plain. The river ends at the Pacific Ocean after flowing across the north side of this plain made fertile with the silt deposited by the river. A sand bar usually stands across the mouth at the Santa Clara Estuary Natural Preserve that lies within McGrath State Beach in Oxnard and bounded on the north by the city of Ventura wastewater treatment plant.    Watershed  Although located just north of the heavily populated Los Angeles Basin, the 1,600 sq mi (4,100 km2) Santa Clara River watershed remains one of the most natural on the South Coast. It is separated from the Los Angeles Basin by the low Santa Susana Mountains, along the north side of which the Santa Clara River runs. On the east are the San Gabriel Mountains, and on the north are the Santa Ynez Mountains, Sespe Mountains, San Cayetano Mountains, and Tehachapi Mountains. Piru, Castaic and Sespe Creeks, each over 50 mi (80 km) long, are the primary tributaries of the Santa Clara River. While Piru and Castaic Creeks form reservoirs for the California State Water Project (Pyramid Lake and Lake Piru on Piru Creek, and Elderberry Forebay and Castaic Lake on Castaic Creek), Sespe Creek is designated a National Wild and Scenic River, unique among Southern California streams. There are 57 archaeological sites and 12 historical landmarks in the watershed.  The Santa Clara River watershed borders on the Ventura River/Matilija Creek watershed on the west. On the northwest lies the Santa Ynez River watershed. On the north is the interior drainage basin of Tulare Lake in the Central Valley. Michael Eric Engh( born December 14, 1949) is an American Jesuit priest, academic and historian. He served as the 28th President of Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California from January 5, 2009 to June 30, 2019. Peter Alexander Ferdinand Maximilian Neumayer (30 June 1926 – 12 February 2011), commonly known as Peter Alexander, was an Austrian actor, singer and one of the most popular entertainers in the German-language world between the 1950s and his retirement. His fame emerged in the 1950s and 1960s through popular film comedies and successful recordings, predominantly of Schlager and operetta repertory. Later, Alexander established himself as the acclaimed host of television shows. His career as a live singer touring the German language countries lasted until 1991, while he continued his television work until 1996.    Life and career  Born in Vienna, Alexander attended the Max Reinhardt Seminar for actors until 1948 and then began his career in acting. He starred in several musical comedies, including Liebe, Tanz und 1000 Schlager and Peter schießt den Vogel ab. He recorded Ralph Benatzky's operetta Im weißen Rößl, singing the lead role of Leopold Brandmeyer. He then performed in the 1960 movie version of the operetta. He later starred in the Count Bobby movies and the Lümmel-series. In the 1970s, Alexander started a second career as a TV host and entertainer. His music show, the Peter Alexander Show, was shown on black and white TV from 1963 until 1966. From 1969, the German TV station ZDF started to air a new colour version which was broadcast until 1996. The Peter Alexander Show has been seen by more than 38 million viewers and has averaged a 71% viewing rate. After his death, Media Control Charts named him the biggest singles artist ever with 459 songs having charted on the German singles chart. The single \"Und manchmal weinst du sicher ein paar Tränen\" had the longest run with 34 weeks on that chart, while 2 other songs, \"Der letzte Walzer\" and \"Liebesleid\", were able to reach the No. 1 position. Alexander won 10 Bambi Awards and in 1996 was awarded a Bambi for lifetime achievement. Alexander married Hilde Haagen in 1952; they had two children, Susanne Neumayer-Haidinger (1958–2009), an artist, and Michael Neumayer (1963–2019). The Star of India may refer to: Santa Paula (Spanish for \"St. Paula\") is a city in Ventura County, California, United States. Situated amid the orchards of the Santa Clara River Valley, the city advertises itself to tourists as the \"Citrus Capital of the World\". Santa Paula was one of the early centers of California's petroleum industry. The Union Oil Company Building, the founding headquarters of the Union Oil Company of California in 1890, now houses the California Oil Museum. The population was 30,657 at the 2020 census, up from 29,321 at the 2010 census.    History  The area of what today is Santa Paula was inhabited by the Chumash, a Native American people, before the Spanish arrived. In 1769, the Spanish Portola expedition, first Europeans to see inland areas of California, came down the Santa Clara River Valley from the previous night's encampment near Fillmore and camped in the vicinity of Santa Paula on August 12, near one of the creeks coming into the valley from the north (most likely Santa Paula Creek). Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary traveling with the expedition, had previously named the valley Cañada de Santa Clara. He noted that the party traveled about 9 to 10 miles (14 to 16 km) that day and camped near a large native village, which he named San Pedro Amoliano. The site of the expedition's arrival has been designated California Historical Landmark No. 727. Franciscan missionaries, led by Father Junipero Serra, became active in the area after the founding of the San Buenaventura Mission and established an Asistencia; the town takes its name from the Catholic Saint Paula. Santa Paula is located on the 1843 Rancho Santa Paula y Saticoy Mexican land grant. In 1872 Nathan Weston Blanchard purchased 2,700 acres (10.9 km2) and laid out the townsite. Considered the founder of the community, he planted seedling orange trees in 1874. Several small oil companies owned by Wallace Hardison, Lyman Stewart  and Thomas R. Bard were combined and became the Union Oil Company in 1890. Santa Paula was incorporated in April 1902. The first mayor was Lewis Arthur Hardison.  In April 1911, Gaston Méliès moved his Star Film Company from San Antonio, Texas to a site just north of Santa Paula. The large South Mountain Oil Field southeast of town, just across the Santa Clara River, was discovered by the Oak Ridge Oil Company in 1916, and developed methodically through the 1920s, bringing further economic diversification and growth to the area.  While the field peaked in production in the 1950s, Occidental Petroleum continues to extract oil through its Vintage Production subsidiary and remains a significant local employer. A major expansion began in 2016 when construction started on a 500-acre (200 ha) master-planned community of 1,500 homes.    Disasters  The town has been devastated by floods, fires, and was once affected by a nearby truck explosion that resulted in an industrial disaster.    Floods     The Great Flood of 1862   The Great Flood of 1862 began on December 24, 1861, when it rained for almost four weeks, reaching a total of 35 inches (890 mm) at Los Angeles.     St. Francis Dam Disaster   The failure and near complete collapse of the St. Francis Dam took place in the middle of the night on March 12, 1928. The dam was holding a full reservoir of 12.4 billion gallons (47 billion liters) of water that surged down San Francisquito Canyon and emptied into the Santa Clara River. The town was first hit by the waters at approximately 3:00 a.m. Though hundreds of homes and structures were destroyed, the loss of life would have been greater if it were not for two motorcycle police officers that noisily warned as many people as possible. A sculpture called \"The Watchers\" in downtown Santa Paula depicts this act of heroism.    Wildfires     Thomas Fire   In December 2017, the Thomas Fire broke out nearby. While it was the largest wildfire in modern California history at the time, the Santa Ana winds drove the fire toward Ventura and Santa Barbara. Over a thousand structures were destroyed which included a few out buildings just outside the city. It was finally confirmed to be fully contained in January 2018, and a reported 281,893 acres (440 sq mi; 114,078 ha) had burned. One firefighter and one civilian were the only fatalities directly caused by the fire. Kathy Watanabe is the Council Member for District 1 of the City of Santa Clara. She was appointed to the council on March 7, 2016 by a vote of 4- 2 by the then current council members, then won the city council election in November 2016 with 48% of the vote to keep her seat. There has been some criticism that the Santa Clara city council remains all white, however she is also the only councilmember representing the Northside of the city. Kathy serves on the Downtown Revitalization Plan, Audit, Bicycle Pedestrian Advisory, Facilities Naming and Honorary Recognition Ad Hoc, Police Activities League( PAL) and Santa Clara Sister Cities Association committees. As part of her council duties, Kathy serves on the following committees: Caltrain Modernization Local Policymaker Group( Cal Mod or LPMG) Cities Association of Santa Clara County- Board of Directors( Alternate), Cities Association of Santa Clara County- City Selection Committee( Alternate), Cities Association of Santa Clara County- Legislative Action Committee( Alternate), City/ School Liaison Committee( Santa Clara Unified School District)( Alternate), Grand Boulevard Task Force/ El Camino Real, Human Trafficking Commission, Joint Recycled Water Policy Advisory Committee( Alternate), Recycling and Waste Reduction Commission of Santa Clara County( RWRC), San Jose/ Santa Clara Treatment Plant Advisory Committee( TPAC), Santa Clara County Expressway Plan 2040 Policy Advisory Board( PAB), Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority( SCVTA) Policy Advisory Committee( PAC) and the Santa Clara Valley Water Commission( SCVW)( Alternate). On December 19, 2017, the Council unanimously voted for Kathy to serve as Vice Mayor for the City of Santa Clara for 2018. Sir Robert Graham Stephens (14 July 1931 – 12 November 1995) was a leading English actor in the early years of Britain's Royal National Theatre. He was one of the most respected actors of his generation and was at one time regarded as the natural successor to Laurence Olivier.    Early life and career  Stephens was born in Shirehampton, Bristol, in 1931, the eldest of three children of shipyard labourer and costing surveyor Reuben Stephens (1905 – 1985) and chocolate-factory worker Gladys Millicent (née Deverill; 1906 – 1975). When aged 18, he won a scholarship to Esme Church's Bradford Civic Theatre School in Yorkshire, where he met his first wife Nora, a fellow student. His first professional engagement was with the Caryl Jenner Mobile Theatre, which he followed in 1951 by a year of more challenging parts in repertory at the Royalty Theatre, Morecambe, followed by seasons of touring and at the Hippodrome, Preston. London director Tony Richardson saw a performance at the Royalty; this led to an offer of a place in the \"momentous\" first season of English Stage Company at the Royal Court in 1956. Stephens's success was assured. He appeared in two versions of Epitaph for George Dillon on Broadway during the 1958-59 season for which he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. His early films included A Taste of Honey (1961), Cleopatra (1963) and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969) with his then wife Maggie Smith. There was also a minor role as Prince Escalus in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968), as well as a starring role in Billy Wilder's The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970) and the gothic horror film The Asphyx (1972). Stephens played Atahuallpa in the original 1964 National Theatre production of The Royal Hunt of the Sun. He and Smith appeared together on stage and in film, notably in The Recruiting Officer at the Old Vic and the film version of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie in 1969. However, following his departure from the National Theatre in 1970 and the break-up of their marriage in 1973, he suffered a career slump, not helped by heavy drinking and a breakdown. Although he continued to work on stage (notably in the National Theatre's The Mysteries in 1986), film (The Fruit Machine in 1988—titled Wonderland in the US—and Kenneth Branagh's Henry V), and television (notably in the role of Abner Brown in the 1984 BBC TV dramatisation of the children's classic The Box of Delights and as the Master of an Oxford college in an episode of Inspector Morse), it was not until the 1990s that he re-established himself at the forefront of his profession, when the Royal Shakespeare Company invited him to play Falstaff in Henry IV for director Adrian Noble (opening April 1991), the title roles in Julius Caesar (director Steven Pimlott) later in the year and then King Lear, again for Noble, in May 1993. He was awarded the Laurence Olivier Theatre Award in 1993 for Best Actor, for his performance as Falstaff. Stephens provided the voice of Aragorn in the 1981 BBC Radio serialisation of The Lord of the Rings.

He delivered the film's famous final line: \"It wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast.\"\n\n\n== Early years ==\nBorn in Saginaw, Michigan, Armstrong lived in Bay City, Michigan until about 1902 and moved to Seattle. He attended the University of Washington, where he studied law, and became a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nArmstrong first started acting in the stage in 1919 with the production of Boys Will Be Boys.  Armstrong's silver screen career began in 1927 when he appeared in Pathé's silent drama The Main Event. He appeared in 127 films between 1927 and 1964; very prolific in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he made nine movies in 1928 alone. He is best known for his role as filmmaker Carl Denham in King Kong. Months later, he starred as Denham again in the sequel, Son of Kong, released the same year. Armstrong resembled King Kong producer and adventurer Merian C. Cooper, and Cooper used him in several films as more or less a version of himself. The Most Dangerous Game was filmed at night on the same jungle sets as King Kong, which was shot during the day, with Armstrong and Fay Wray simultaneously starring in both pictures. In 1937, Armstrong starred in With Words and Music (also referred to as The Girl Said No), released by Grand National Films Inc. He also worked throughout the 1930s and 1940s for many film studios. Prior to World War II, in 1940, Universal Pictures released Enemy Agent, about countering a Nazi spy ring. In the film, Armstrong co-starred with Helen Vinson, Richard Cromwell and Jack La Rue. In 1942, he was reteamed with Cromwell in Baby Face Morgan, a notable B movie for PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation). Later in that decade, Armstrong played another Carl Denham-like leading character role as \"Max O'Hara\" in 1949's Mighty Joe Young. This film was another stop-motion animation giant gorilla fantasy, made by the same King Kong team of Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack.\nIn the 1950s, he appeared as Sheriff Andy Anderson on Rod Cameron's syndicated western-themed television series, State Trooper.  Armstrong made four guest appearances on Perry Mason during its nine-year run on CBS: in 1958, he played as Walter Haskell in \"The Case of the Sardonic Sergeant\"; in 1961 he played the title character and murder victim Captain Bancroft in \"The Case of the Malicious Mariner\"; in 1962 he played defendant Jimmy West in \"The Case of the Playboy Pugilist\"; and in 1964 he played murderer Phil Jenks in \"The Case of the Accosted Accountant.\"\n\n\n== Marriages ==\nPeggy Allenby (August 1920 - April 17, 1925; divorced) (died 1966)\nEthel Virah Smith (June 12, 1926 - July 27, 1931; divorced) (died 1950)\nGladys Dubois (January 10, 1936 - December 31, 1939; divorced) (died 1971)\nClaire Louise Frisbie (January 1, 1940 - April 20, 1973; his death) (died 1990)\n\n\n== Death ==\nArmstrong died of cancer in Santa Monica, California.

Under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, he was paired with Myrna Loy in 14 films, including the Thin Man series based on the Nick and Nora Charles characters created by Dashiell Hammett. Powell was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor three times: for The Thin Man (1934), My Man Godfrey (1936), and Life with Father (1947).    Early life  Powell was born in Pittsburgh in 1892, the only child of Nettie Manila (née Brady) and Horatio Warren Powell, an accountant. In 1907, young William moved with his family to Kansas City, Missouri, where he graduated from Central High School four years later.    Career   After high school, Powell enrolled at the University of Kansas to study law, but after a week he relocated to New York City, where he attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1912, Powell left the AADA, and began working in vaudeville and stock companies. He also appeared on Broadway. Powell began his Hollywood career in 1922, in a production of Sherlock Holmes with John Barrymore. He performed as Francis I in When Knighthood Was in Flower with Marion Davies. Powell remained under contract to Paramount throughout the 1920s, before signing with Warner Bros.  Powell portrayed a vengeful film director in the silent movie The Last Command (1928). His first starring role was Philo Vance in The Canary Murder Case (1929). He played Vance  at Paramount Pictures four times. His strong stage-developed voice became a powerful asset when talking pictures were introduced.  Powell appeared as Nick Charles in six Thin Man films, beginning with The Thin Man in 1934, based upon Dashiell Hammett's novel. This movie provided Powell with his first Academy Award nomination, in 1935 Powell starred in The Great Ziegfeld, (1936), opposite his The Thin Man co-star, Myrna Loy, who played Ziegfeld's wife, Billie Burke. In 1937, Powell received his second Academy Award nomination for the comedy My Man Godfrey. In 1935, he starred with Jean Harlow in Reckless. In 1936, Harlow and Powell appeared in Libeled Lady, and they became romantically involved off-set. He gave her a handsome ring, but did not ask her to marry him, so she referred to it as her \"unengagement ring\". Powell had been unhappy with his previous marriage to popular actor Carole Lombard, and this apparently kept him from entering a similar arrangement with Harlow, who was a sex symbol to the film-going public during that time. They kept company but did not live together. Harlow fell ill from undiagnosed kidney failure while working on a film with Clark Gable, and died before the film was completed, from uremia, at age 26 in June 1937. Powell received his third Academy Award nomination in 1947 for his role as Clarence Day Sr. in Life with Father. His last film was playing the character Doc in 1955's Mister Roberts.    Personal life   On April 15, 1915, Powell married Eileen Wilson, who was born Julia Mary Tierney. The couple had a son, William David Powell. They divorced in 1930. Powell's son became a television writer and producer before a period of ill health and depression led to his suicide in 1968. On June 26, 1931, Powell married actress Carole Lombard. They divorced in 1933, but starred in My Man Godfrey three years later. Powell was devastated by her death in an airplane crash in 1942. He was romantically involved with Jean Harlow, his co-star in Reckless (1935), until her unexpected death from illness in 1937. On January 6, 1940, three weeks after they met, Powell married his third wife, actress Diana Lewis, who cancelled her film career to be his full-time wife. They remained married until his death in 1984. A Republican, Powell supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election and the 1948 United States presidential election.    Cancer  In March 1938, Powell was diagnosed with rectal cancer. He underwent surgery and experimental radium treatment, which put the disease in full remission within two years. Given his own health and sorrow over Jean Harlow's death, Powell did not undertake any film roles for more than a year during this period.    Death  Powell died in Palm Springs, California, on March 5, 1984, at the age of 91 from pneumonia. Sanda Dia was a Belgian student who died in the Antwerp University Hospital in 2018 as a result of a Reuzegom fraternity hazing ritual in Vorselaar when he was aged 20. He was a student at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (known as \"KU Leuven\").   On 4 and 5 December 2018, Dia was obliged to drink fish sauce, alcoholic drinks and stand outdoors in freezing water, amongst being subject to other humiliating and degrading acts. After collapsing, he was driven to hospital where he died of multiple organ failure two days later. His death was attributed to the salt content in the fish sauce he ingested. The medical doctor and forensic pathologist expert Werner Jacobs told in the Hasselt Court that Dia had several injuries caused by violent acts. Four years later, the accused were ordered to pay fines of €400 each and were sentenced to 200 or 300 hours of community service by the Antwerp Court of Appeal.    Sanda Dia  Dia was an engineering student from Edegem He was 20 years old at the time of his death. His father was a refugee from Senegal.  He was in good health prior to his death.     Hazing and death  On 5 December 2018, in a woodland cabin in Vorselaar, as part of a hazing ritual, Dia was obliged to drink copious amounts of alcohol before standing half-naked, outside in the cold, in a pool of freezing water and consuming a live goldfish before being forced to throw it back up by drinking dangerous, lethal amounts of fish sauce. The hazing was a ritual of the Reuzegom fraternity at KU Leuven. After hours in the freezing pool, Dia went into cardiac arrest and collapsed.  Fraternity members then drove him to a local hospital in Malle. A nurse said she had the impression that the young men did not realise how serious his condition was (despite the fact that one of the Reuzegom members present at the hazing was a student in medicine – he however did not assist in helping Dia at any stage). At 21:49, Dia was transferred to the University Hospital of Antwerp, where hospital staff alerted the police.  After the hazing, fraternity members, assisted by parents and by ex-members, coordinated the deleting of evidence like text messages and video recordings from their phones and cleaned up the cabin and its surroundings, in an attempt to cover up what had happened. The next day a few members went to clean up Dia’s student room as well, in attempt to cover as much evidence as possible. When the police arrived at the cabin at 3:53 a.m., on December 6, the scene had been cleaned.  On December 7, Dia died of multiple-organ failure.  The coroner attributed his death to salt toxicity, attributable to the consumption of the fish oil. The amount of salt in his body was comparable to a person who drank 4 litres (0.88 imp gal; 1.1 US gal) (1.06 gal) of seawater. This caused acute cerebral edema (swelling of the brain).    Aftermath  The lawyer of Dia's father requested a reconstruction of the events that led to Dia's death; his request was not granted. KU Leuven initially suspended the students but permitted them to resume studying later. The Reuzegom fraternity was disbanded after Dia's death. On 26 May 2023, at the Antwerp Court of Appeal, eighteen students were each found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and degrading. Each of the students were acquitted of other charges, including culpable neglect and administering a harmful substance causing death or illness. They were fined €400 each and required to do community service sentences of 200 or 300 hours each. The students were additionally obliged to pay damages to the Dia family, €15,000 to his father, €8,000 to his brother and €6,000 to his stepmother. His mother sought and obtained damages of €1. Prosecutors had requested jail sentences for the perpetrators, seeking convictions of between 18 and 50 months. After a crowd-funding campaign, friends commissioned a mural of Dia. Protests against the sentencing for those that caused the death of Dia, and class-based justice occurred in Leuven, Antwerp, Brussels, Bruges and Ghent. \"Fok Reuzegom\" was painted on a roof near the Leuven railway station. In the Netherlands there were protests in Rotterdam and The Hague, nearby the Belgian Embassy.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "answer": "Danger: Diabolik",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Which film whose director is younger, Charge It To Me or Danger: Diabolik?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nDiabolik (Italian: [djaˈbɔːlik, djaboˈlik]) is an Italian comic series created by sisters Angela and Luciana Giussani. One of the most popular series in the history of Italian comics, Diabolik was created in 1962 and consists of more than 900 volumes, and has led to the birth of the fumetti neri comic subgenre. The series is named after its protagonist, an anti-heroic thief, inspired by several previous pulp fiction characters from Italy and other countries. Its stories consist of monthly black-and-white, digest-sized volumes. The series takes place in the fictional town Clerville and stars the titular Diabolik, initially represented as a ruthless and cruel thief who does not hesitate to murder anyone in order to accomplish his deeds, aided by his partner and lover Eva Kant. Over time, the character evolved his personality, developing healthy roots and ethical principles such as honor, the sense of friendship and gratitude, and respect for noble souls. He focused on robbing and killing other criminals. Throughout his adventures, he is pursued mainly by the Inspector Ginko. The series sold more than 150 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-known and best-selling comics series from Europe. Live-action film adaptations were made: Danger: Diabolik (1968) and a film trilogy consisting in Diabolik (2021), Diabolik - Ginko Attacks! (2022) and Diabolik - Who Are You? (2023). Its success had also inspired a radio show, an animated television series, video games, novels, and countless parodies.    Creation and development  The idea for the character of Diabolik was born from seeing commuters every day. Co-creator Angela Giussani, who lived near Milano Cadorna railway station, thought of making comics in a format designed for travelling and carrying in one's pocket. To better understand the tastes of her potential readers, Angela made a survey of the market, from which she concluded that many commuters read mystery novels. Another version of the story claims that the very idea came from her finding a Fantomas novel abandoned in a train. Thus, was born the \"Diabolik format\" (a small 12 x 17 cm (7 in) book), which proved popular with other publications in the same genre. The pocketbook format contributed, in fact, to the success of the character.    Plot  Diabolik is a ruthless master thief. He typically steals from criminals (and has no issue with killing them if need be, but rarely, if ever, kills the innocent or the police), and has a set of lifelike masks which he uses to fool his opponents, assuming every identity at will. He seems to have a deep knowledge in many scientific fields, including chemistry, mechanics, and computers. In his first appearances, Diabolik was a more straightforward villain who did not hesitate to murder anyone in order to accomplish his deeds. He was later given a more \"Robin Hood\"-like persona and was shown stealing essentially from criminals, in order to soften the series’ violence and amorality. He was raised as an orphan on a secret island hideout of a criminal combine, where he learned all his criminal skills, including developing his special masks, before killing the head of the combine. Diabolik's true name had never been revealed in the series, and he does not know it himself. Diabolik took his name from a dangerous black panther that the head of the combine killed on the secret island. From issue #3 of the series, Diabolik is aided by his \"moll\", Eva Kant, who has gained an increasing role as his partner and lover. Diabolik always drives a black 1961 Jaguar E-type. Graphically inspired by the actor Robert Taylor, he usually wears a skintight black body suit that leaves only his eyes and eyebrows (very distinctive ones) exposed when going \"into action\". Diabolik does not use firearms: his main weapons are the daggers he throws with uncanny ability, as well as a small dart gun with knockout darts. Eva drives a white Jaguar, and unusually goes into action wearing a heavy sweater and pants, no mask and no revealing clothing. The stories are set in a fictional town, Clerville, loosely inspired by Geneva, Switzerland. Diabolik's main opponent is Inspector Ginko, known only by his surname, a fierce and incorruptible police officer who is almost always thwarted by astute tricks devised by Diabolik. The only other recurring character is the noblewoman Altea, Ginko's fiancée.    Characters   Main characters  Diabolik - a legendary thief who follows an ancient code of conduct. Eva Kant - Diabolik's lover and accomplice, she is a skilled and ruthless criminal in her own right. Their relationship begins as adversarial, then he becomes her lover.

The film stars Margarita Fischer and Emory Johnson. The film was released on May 4, 1919, by Pathé Exchange. == Plot ==\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Picture Gallery == Timothy Ray Lucas (born May 30, 1956) is an American film critic, biographer, novelist, screenwriter and blogger, best known for publishing and editing the video review magazine Video Watchdog.    Biography and early career  Lucas, born in Cincinnati, Ohio, was the only child of Marion Frank Lucas, a typesetter and musician, and the former Juanita Grace Wilson; his father died six months prior to his birth, on November 14, 1955, of a congenital heart ailment at age 33. Tim Lucas subsequently spent most of his childhood in the homes of various relatives and caregivers, seeing his widowed mother only on weekends, when she took him to drive-in theaters. After publishing single issues of two fanzines, he became a film critic and cartoonist for Norwood High School's newspaper The Mirror. He began writing professionally in 1972 when he became a regular reviewer and correspondent for the influential fantasy film magazine Cinefantastique. He wrote for the magazine for 11 years. Though Lucas did not graduate high school, he succeeded in placing an essay about Anthony Burgess in the Autumn 1981 issue Purdue University's literary quarterly Modern Fiction Studies. His article, The Old Shelley Game: Prometheus and Predestination in Burgess's Works, was subsequently anthologized in Modern Critical Views: Anthony Burgess (1987, ISBN 0-87754-676-2), a collection \"of the best criticism available upon the novels of Anthony Burgess\" in the words of its editor, Harold Bloom.    Video Times  In 1984, Lucas began reviewing Betamax and VHS releases for the Chicago-based magazine Video Times. The editors then hired him to edit and co-author a series of twelve paperback video guides published in the summer and winter of 1985 by Signet Books. Of these, he wrote the introductions to all twelve and the entirety of four: Movie Classics, Horror, Science Fiction & Fantasy and Mystery & Suspense. The books were formally credited to \"The Editors of Video Times\" with Lucas receiving credit only on the copyright pages.    \"Video Watchdog\"  In October 1985, Video Times published the first installment of a new Lucas column, \"Video Watchdog\", in which he investigated the changes made to various films (usually horror, cult and fantasy) when they appeared on video.  With the dissolution of Video Times in 1986, the column resurfaced as a shot-on-video featurette, hosted and narrated by Lucas, in Pacific Arts Corporation's one-shot video-magazine-on-video experiment Overview, produced by Michael Nesmith. Video Watchdog was subsequently reborn in the pages of the Fangoria spin-off Gorezone, where it regularly appeared from 1988 for a few years. These early columns were later collected with other material in The Video Watchdog Book (1992, ISBN 0-9633756-0-1). With his wife, Donna Lucas, Lucas launched Video Watchdog as a separate magazine in June 1990. Video Watchdog added full color covers with #13 (September/October 1992), increased its frequency from bimonthly to monthly with #55 (January 2000), and changed to a full interior color format with its 100th issue (October 2003). Its contributors include Kim Newman, Ramsey Campbell, David J. Schow and Douglas E. Winter. The magazine's 20th Anniversary issue was published in June 2010. Director Quentin Tarantino praised Video Watchdog in the pages of the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano as \"l'unica rivista di cinema autorevole al mondo\" (\"the only reliable film magazine in the world\"). In October 2016, Lucas said Video Watchdog would cease publication with its 184th issue     Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark  Lucas's critical biography Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark (ISBN 0-9633756-1-X), a vast work thirty-two years in preparation, with an introduction by Martin Scorsese, was published in August 2007 by Video Watchdog. This 1,128-page work received words of praise from such filmmakers as Guillermo del Toro and Joe Dante. In the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano in 2010, Quentin Tarantino called it \"the best book on films ever written.\"    Videodrome  Lucas' Videodrome, a study of the 1983 David Cronenberg film, inaugurated the Studies in the Horror Film line from Centipede Press in September 2008. Leave It to Me  is a 1955 Czech comedy film directed by Martin Frič. Black Moon is a 1934 American pre-Code horror film directed by Roy William Neill and starring Jack Holt, Fay Wray, and Dorothy Burgess. It is based on a short story by Clements Ripley that first appeared in Hearst's International-Cosmopolitan. The film centers on a young woman who returns to the tropical island where her parents were murdered during a voodoo ritual with her daughter and nanny, only to become corrupted by the native's dark rituals.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA young girl, Juanita, finds her parents killed in a voodoo ritual on a distant tropical island.  She escapes with her life, but when she reaches adulthood, she feels compelled to return to the island, bringing her daughter and a nanny who takes care of the child. Once there, she goes to stay with her uncle who lives on the island.  She soon discovers that the natives, who had been using her for voodoo rituals when she was a child, now treat her as a voodoo goddess.  In this role, she begins leading their rituals.\nAny attempt to fight Juanita's influence or to remove her from her position is met with violent force.  One person is found dead in a lava pit, while another is found hanged.  At one point, Juanita is so overcome by the voodoo curse that she offers her daughter up for sacrifice.  Juanita's businessman husband, Stephen, follows her to the island and attempts to travel into the jungle to rescue her, but finds her taking part in a sacrifice of an innocent woman.  Although he shoots the high priest of the tribe, Juanita completes the sacrifice herself.\nTheir high priest injured, the natives now plan to murder all of the white people on the island.  Stephen takes his daughter and two others into the fortified section of a plantation house. The natives succeed in capturing Stephen and his secretary, Gail, but they are eventually rescued. In the end, Stephen shoots and kills Juanita just as she is about to sacrifice her own daughter.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nCast adapted from the book Columbia Pictures Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy Films.\n\n\n== Production ==\nBlack Moon was based on the novel by Clements Ripley which first appeared in Hearst's International-Cosmopolitan.

For example, the native ritual which precedes the main or throat-cutting event has a precision in the dance routines and mass singing that suggests the Busby Berkeley touch.\" A reviewer in Variety commented that direction in Black Moon was \"commendable and the acting is good, but the scenario possesses dubious elements\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nPitts, Michael.

Directed by Roy William Neill, it was his final feature film. Produced by Universal Pictures, it is set in Los Angeles and broadly adapted from Cornell Woolrich's 1943 novel The Black Angel.    Plot  It's their anniversary, and alcoholic pianist and composer Marty Blair wants to see Mavis Marlowe but she doesn't want to see him.  Not even after the giant ruby brooch he'd had delivered. The doorman at her swanky apartment gets the word, and gives Marty the bum's rush.  Sulking on the sidewalk, he sees another man, obviously expected, ask to visit her and be welcomed up.  Equally fuming, repulsed, and dejected at his estranged secret ex-wife, Marty storms to his corner bar and drowns himself in booze. Later that evening Kirk Bennett also shows up to visit Mavis.  He too is welcomed up by the doorman, only to find Mavis murdered.  He hears a prowler in her apartment, searches for them, but they get away.  In between the new brooch that had been pinned to Mavis' dress disappears. Seen fleeing the scene, the married Bennett is soon picked up by Captain Flood of the Los Angeles Police Department.  He claims Mavis was blackmailing him to conceal their affair, but can offer no proof of someone else being there responsible both for Mavis' death and the theft of her broach.  He is convicted of her murder and sentenced to death. Through it all his wife Catherine has remained steadfast.  Now, while Kirk's days on Death Row tick away toward the gas chamber, she mounts her own vigorous but clumsy investigation of his claims.  One of her first leads takes her to Blair, whom she is convinced was the murderer.  A mothering friend of his (who looks after him during his alcoholic binges) clears him, as had the police.  Marty, it seems, had been locked tight in his own room at the time of the killing. Attracted to Catherine, he volunteers to help her.  When he sees a picture of Kirk he tells her that was not the man he saw whisked in to visit Mavis on the night of the murder. A chance clue leads them to a nightclub, then to its owner, Mr. Marko, whom Marty identifies as the mystery man. Since Catherine used to sing some, Marty suggests they team up and audition for a spot in Marko's club. They get the job, and become convinced Marko is hiding a dark secret when Marty recognizes an envelope from Mavis's personal stationery in his office.  Catherine schemes for a chance to search it in his absence. When she is caught, Captain Flood arrives in time to referee. Marko admits he had been being blackmailed by Mavis over his ex-con background, but the brooch they were sure he had in his safe is not there.  He is cleared as a suspect. Between their detective leg work and cover as a performing duet Catherine and Marty come to spend all their time together, with Marty becoming a welcome daytime visitor to her home.  Their partnership had blossomed into compositions together that along with the nightclub act led to a taste of glamor and celebrity.  Marty had even gone sober.  On the night before Kirk is due to be executed, Marty can't hold it in any more and declares his love for Catherine.  In spite of having \"sacrificed her virtue\" in getting close enough to Mr. Marko to rifle his safe, she tells Marty that Kirk had always been the only man for her, and would remain so. Devastated, Marty goes on a bender, and in a carousel of bars chances on a dame wearing the missing brooch. When she asks him where he's been since giving it to her, it comes clear that he had pinned it on her himself the night of the murder. The shock of this discovery triggers a flashback.  In his delirium, Marty realizes that it was actually he who had strangled Mavis and taken the brooch, then buried the traumatic memory in a drunken stupor.  Paying the usual quarter, he'd bribed his building's janitor to let him out of his room that night, and stumbled up the stairs to Mavis' apartment when the doorman was distracted. He tries to contact Captain Flood to confess in time to save Kirk, but Flood is out on a case.  After several failed efforts he leaves a message for Flood to call him at Catherine's home, but is passed out drunk when the phone rings. Come daylight, Catherine returns from a visit to the prison to say a final goodbye to Kirk.  She finds and rouses Marty, who begins to reflexively confess.  Flood glides into the room and hears it all. Mario Bava (31 July 1914 – 27 April 1980) was an Italian cinematographer, director, special effects artist and screenwriter, frequently referred to as the \"Master of Italian Horror\" and the \"Master of the Macabre\". His low-budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, and the destructive capacity of human nature. Born to sculptor, cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava, the younger Bava followed his father into the film industry, and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy's foremost cameramen, lighting and providing the special effects for such films as \"Hercules\" (1958) and its sequel \"Hercules Unchained\" (1959) (each were lampooned on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\"). During the late 1950s, his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers, including \"I Vampiri\" (1957) (the first Italian horror film of the sound era), \"The Day the Sky Exploded\" (1958) (the first Italian science fiction film), \"Caltiki – The Immortal Monster\" (1959) and \"The Giant of Marathon\" (1959). Although most of Bava's films as director failed to achieve major commercial success upon release, many of them would eventually find acclaim as cult classics, with their content and production values being favourably compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock. Several of them have been noted for their revolutionary impact on their respective genres: \"Black Sunday\" (1960), his official directorial debut, was the forerunner of the Italian gothic horror film cycle; \"The Girl Who Knew Too Much\" (1963) is considered to be the first giallo film; \"Kill, Baby, Kill\" (1966) heavily influenced the iconography of modern J-Horror; \"Roy Colt & Winchester Jack\" (1970) is regarded as one of the earliest self-parodying Spaghetti Westerns; \" Four Times That Night\" (1971) was an early Italian sex comedy; and \"A Bay of Blood\" (1971) was a precursor to slasher films. His other notable films include \"Hercules in the Haunted World\" (1961), \"Erik the Conqueror\" (1961), \"Black Sabbath\" (1963), \"The Whip and the Body\" (1963), \"Blood and Black Lace\" (1964), \"Planet of the Vampires\" (1965), \"Knives of the Avenger\" (1966),  (1968), \"Hatchet for the Honeymoon\" (1970), \"Five Dolls for an August Moon\" (1970), \"Baron Blood\" (1972), \"Lisa and the Devil\" (1974), \"Rabid Dogs\" (1974) and \"Shock\" (1977). Despite his reputation as a talented artist during his lifetime, Bava's shy, self-deprecating demeanour prevented him from taking advantage of opportunities that would have furthered his international standing within the film industry, and he turned down multiple opportunities to work in Hollywood. Among the filmmakers Bava and his work have influenced include Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Federico Fellini, John Carpenter, Nicolas Winding Refn, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, Joe Dante, John Landis, Francis Ford Coppola, Roger Corman, Edgar Wright, Jennifer Kent and Quentin Tarantino. His son and frequent assistant director, Lamberto Bava, later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right. Mario Bava (31 July 1914 – 27 April 1980) was an Italian filmmaker who worked variously as a director, cinematographer, special effects artist and screenwriter. His low-budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and stylish technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, as well as the destructive capacity of human nature. Widely regarded as a pioneer of Italian genre cinema and one of the most influential auteurs of the horror film genre, he is popularly referred to as the \"Master of Italian Horror\" and the \"Master of the Macabre\". After providing special effects work and other assistance on such productions as I Vampiri (1957), Hercules (1958) and Caltiki – The Immortal Monster (1959), Bava made his official feature directorial debut with the gothic horror film Black Sunday, released in 1960. He went on to direct such films as The Girl Who Knew Too Much, Black Sabbath, The Whip and the Body (all released in 1963), Blood and Black Lace (1964), Planet of the Vampires (1965), Kill, Baby, Kill (1966), Danger: Diabolik (1968), A Bay of Blood (1971), Baron Blood (1972), Lisa and the Devil (1974) and Rabid Dogs (1974). According to the British Film Institute, \"Bava took a vital role in the creation of the modern horror film. If there was to be a Mount Rushmore-style monument dedicated to four directors whose work pioneered a new form of big screen chills and thrills, those giant faces etched in granite on the mountainside would be: Bava, Alfred Hitchcock, Georges Franju and Michael Powell.\"    Family  Born to sculptor, cinematographer and special effects pioneer Eugenio Bava, the younger Mario Bava followed his father into the film industry, and eventually earned a reputation as one of Italy's foremost cameramen, lighting and providing the special effects for such films as Hercules (1958) and its sequel Hercules Unchained (1959) (both were lampooned on Mystery Science Theater 3000).  Mario Bava's son and frequent assistant director Lamberto Bava, later became a noted fantasy and horror film director in his own right.    Biography  Mario Bava was born in Sanremo, Liguria on 31 July 1914. He was the son of Eugenio Bava (1886-1966), a sculptor who also worked as a special effects photographer and cameraman in the Italian silent movie industry. Mario Bava's first ambition was to become a painter. Unable to turn out paintings at a profitable rate, he went into his father's business, working as an assistant to other Italian cinematographers like Massimo Terzano. He also helped his father at the special effects department at Benito Mussolini's film factory, the Istituto Luce. Bava became a cinematographer himself in 1939, shooting two short films with Roberto Rossellini. He made his feature debut in the early 1940s. Bava's camerawork was an instrumental factor in developing the screen personas of such stars of the period as Gina Lollobrigida, Steve Reeves and Aldo Fabrizi. During the late 1950s, his eventual career trajectory as a director began when he was relied upon to complete projects begun by or credited to his colleague Riccardo Freda and other filmmakers, including I Vampiri (1957) (the first Italian horror film of the sound era), The Day the Sky Exploded (1958) (the first Italian science fiction film), Caltiki – The Immortal Monster (1959) and The Giant of Marathon (1959). Bava collaborates in I vampiri (a.k.a. The Devil's Commandment) for director Riccardo Freda in 1956, a movie now referred to as the first Italian horror film. Bava was originally hired as the cinematographer, but when Freda walked out on the project midway through production, Bava completed the film in several days, even creating the innovative special effects that were needed. He also handled the cinematography and special effects on the 1955 Kirk Douglas epic Ulysses and the 1957 Steve Reeves classic Hercules, two films credited with sparking the Italian sword and sandal genre. Bava co-directed The Day the Sky Exploded in 1958, the first Italian science fiction film, predating even the sci-fi films of Antonio Margheriti. Because he had no earlier credited experience as a director, the film was credited solely to Paolo Heusch.  In 1960, Bava directed the gothic horror classic Black Sunday, his first solo directorial effort, which made a genre star out of Barbara Steele. Point Danger or Danger Point may refer: Roy William Neill (4 September 1887 – 14 December 1946) was an Irish-born American film director best known for directing the last eleven of the fourteen Sherlock Holmes films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, made between 1943 and 1946 and released by Universal Studios. == Biography ==\n\nWith his father as the captain, Roy William Neill was born on a ship off the coast of Ireland. Neill lived in the United States for most of his career and was an American citizen. He began directing silent films in 1917 and went on to helm 111 films, 55 of them silent. He was also credited in some works as R. William Neill, Roy W. Neill, and Roy Neill.\nNeill was known for his striking visual style: meticulously lit scenes, careful compositions, and layered shadows that would become the tone of film noir in the late 1940s (his last film, Black Angel (1946), is considered a film noir). Neill's imaginative direction and compositions were noticed by then-low-budget Columbia Pictures, which hired him in 1928.\nRoy William Neill became one of Columbia's dependable directors. His best-known Columbia features are Whirlpool, a Jack Holt vehicle that introduced one of Columbia's major stars, Jean Arthur; and The Black Room (1935), a costume thriller starring Boris Karloff in a dual role. Neill also directed additional scenes, without screen credit, for Frank Capra's 1932 feature American Madness.\nIn 1935 Neill left Columbia for a five-year stay in London, where better opportunities existed for American directors. British film producer Edward Black hired Neill to direct The Lady Vanishes. However, due to delays in production, Black engaged Alfred Hitchcock to direct instead.\nIn 1942 Neill became a producer-director for Universal Pictures. After the studio's first Sherlock Holmes mystery, produced by Howard Benedict and directed by John Rawlins, the studio assigned Roy William Neill to take over the series as both producer and director. Most of Neill's Universal films are atmospheric thrillers, although he did direct one musical, Rhythm of the Islands (1943). His best-known Universal feature, apart from the Sherlock Holmes pictures, is Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943). \nIn 1942, when Universal's major production Flesh and Fantasy was recut after its preview from four sequences to three, the deleted sequence starring Gloria Jean, Alan Curtis, and Frank Craven was shelved. In August 1944, the studio assigned Roy William Neill to expand the half-hour sequence into a full-length feature called The Fugitive. Neill produced the new material but did not direct; the project was rushed through production in less than two weeks while Gloria Jean was available, so Neill had no time to prepare any original direction. The feature version was ultimately released in December 1944 as Destiny.\nAfter Destiny, Neill supervised the Sherlock Holmes series almost exclusively; he remained with Universal through 1946. He died in London, England, from a heart attack.\n\n\n== Filmography == Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man is a 1943 American horror film directed by Roy William Neill and starring Lon Chaney Jr. as Larry Talbot (the Wolf Man) and Bela Lugosi as Frankenstein's monster. The script, written by Curt Siodmak, follows The Ghost of Frankenstein and The Wolf Man, though with a number of retcons. Most significantly, Talbot only transforms into werewolf form during a full moon (rather than every night while wolfsbane is in bloom, as in The Wolf Man), which became a standard part of werewolf lore. The film involves Larry Talbot, who is resurrected when his tomb is disturbed. His search for a way to end his seeming immortality leads to his befriending Frankenstein's monster. Developed under the title Wolf Man Meets Frankenstein, the film was to have Chaney portray both Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man, an idea that was halted before production began because of the physical toll it would take on the actor. The script was filmed with the monster having lines of dialogue, which were removed after the production staff laughed at Bela Lugosi's delivery of the lines during a studio pre-screening. The film was released to what the authors of the book Universal Horrors described as \"lukewarm reviews\". The film was the first of a number of films that were later described as \"monster rallies\", involving having name-brand monsters interact with each other. Universal would follow this with House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula.    Plot  Four years after the events of The Wolf Man and The Ghost of Frankenstein, two graverobbers break into the Talbot family crypt during a full moon. They remove the wolfsbane buried with Larry Talbot. The full moon shines on Larry's body, reviving and transforming him. Larry is found by the police in Cardiff later that night, still with the head wound thought to have killed him, and taken to a hospital where he is treated by Dr. Mannering. During the full moon, Larry becomes the Wolf Man and kills a police constable. The next morning, Larry remembers everything, and implores Mannering to summon police before he kills again. Inspector Owen believes Larry to be an imposter, having confirmed reports of his death, and demands to know his real identity. Larry becomes violently irate, then is overcome by orderlies and bound to his bed with leather straps. Not believing his story of being a werewolf, Mannering and Owen travel to the village of Llanwelly to investigate the Talbot tomb, only to find Larry's body gone, and one of the grave robbers killed in the same manner as the slayings from four years ago. Larry escapes from the hospital by biting through the restraints. Seeking a cure for his apparent inability to die, he leaves Wales and seeks the gypsy Maleva. She opines Dr. Frankenstein may be able to help. Together they travel across Europe to the village Vasaria. Larry hopes to find Dr. Frankenstein's notes in the remains of his estate. Larry transforms and kills a young woman, causing a mob of villagers to chase him down. Fleeing toward the ruins of Frankenstein's castle, Larry falls through the burned-out flooring and into the frozen cellars. He returns to human form, and discovers Frankenstein's monster trapped within ice. Using a stone, Larry breaks the ice and pulls the creature free, hoping he can show him Frankenstein's notes. As the monster is unable to locate the notes, Larry poses as a potential buyer of the Frankenstein estate in order to find Baroness Elsa Frankenstein, the daughter of Ludwig, hoping she knows their hiding place. She declines to assist Larry, but the pair are invited to the \"Festival of the New Wine\" by the Burgomeister. During the festival, Dr. Mannering arrives. Having followed Larry across Europe, Mannering attempts to persuade him to commit himself to a mental institution before having another spell. Larry refuses to go with Mannering. The monster crashes the festival and is attacked by the villagers. Larry guides the monster onto a cart and drives him to safety. Elsa and Mannering agree to help the villagers kill Frankenstein's monster. The following morning, Elsa, Mannering, and Maleva meet with Larry and the monster at the ruins. The Baroness gives the notes to Larry. Larry asks that his life energy be transferred to the monster, believing the laboratory can be repaired for the task. Mannering agrees, but secretly he and Elsa plan to drain both Larry and the monster of life. Mannering begins the procedure, but his curiosity to see the monster at full strength compels him to alter the process and fully revive the monster. Horrified, Elsa attempts to stop the machines, and as a result Larry's life is not fully transferred. The experiment coincides on the night of a full moon, and Larry transforms as the monster regains his strength. The Charge of the Light Brigade was a military action undertaken by British light cavalry against Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War, resulting in many casualties to the cavalry. On 25 October 1854, the Light Brigade, led by Lord Cardigan, mounted a frontal assault against a Russian artillery battery which was well prepared with excellent fields of defensive fire. The charge was the result of a misunderstood order from the commander in chief, Lord Raglan, who had intended the Light Brigade to attack a different objective for which light cavalry was better suited, to prevent the Russians from removing captured guns from overrun Turkish positions. The Light Brigade made its charge under withering direct fire and reached its target, scattering some of the gunners, but was forced to retreat immediately. The events were the subject of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's narrative poem \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (1854), published six weeks after the event. Its lines emphasise the valour of the cavalry in carrying out their orders regardless of the risk. Responsibility for the miscommunication is disputed, as the order was vague and Captain Louis Nolan, who delivered the written orders with some oral interpretation, was killed in the first minute of the assault.    Background   The charge was made by the Light Brigade of the British cavalry, which consisted of the 4th and 13th Light Dragoons, the 17th Lancers, and the 8th and 11th Hussars,  under the command of Major General James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan. Also present that day was the Heavy Brigade, commanded by Major General James Yorke Scarlett, who was a past Commanding Officer of the 5th Dragoon Guards. The Heavy Brigade was made up of the 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, the 5th Dragoon Guards, the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons and the Scots Greys. The two brigades were the only British cavalry force at the battle. The Light Brigade was the British light cavalry force. It rode unarmoured light fast horses. The men were armed with lances and sabres. Optimized for maximum mobility and speed, they were intended for reconnaissance and skirmishing. They were also ideal for cutting down infantry and artillery units as they tried to retreat.  The Heavy Brigade under James Scarlett was the British heavy cavalry force. It rode large, heavy chargers. The men were equipped with metal helmets and armed with cavalry swords for close combat. They were intended as the primary British shock force, leading frontal charges to break enemy lines. Overall command of the British cavalry resided with Lieutenant General George Bingham, 3rd Earl of Lucan. Cardigan and Lucan were brothers-in-law who disliked each other intensely. Lucan received an order from the army commander Lord Raglan stating: \"Lord Raglan wishes the cavalry to advance rapidly to the front, follow the enemy, and try to prevent the enemy carrying away the guns. Troop horse artillery may accompany. French cavalry is on your left. Immediate\". Raglan wanted the light cavalry to prevent the Russians from successfully withdrawing the naval guns from the redoubts they had captured on the reverse side of the Causeway Heights, the hill forming the south side of the valley. This was an optimal task for the Light Brigade, as their superior speed would ensure the Russians would be forced to either quickly abandon the cumbersome guns or be cut down en masse while they tried to flee with them. Raglan could see what was happening from his high vantage point on the west side of the valley. However, the lie of the land around  the cavalry position stopped Lucan from seeing the Russians' efforts to remove the guns from the redoubts.  The order was drafted by Brigadier Richard Airey and carried by Captain Louis Nolan. Nolan carried the further oral instruction that the cavalry was to attack immediately. By Lucan's account, when he asked Nolan what guns were referred to Nolan indicated in a most disrespectful way (with a wide sweep of his arm) the mass of Russian guns at the end of the valley: \"There, my lord, is your enemy; there are your guns.\" His reasons for the misdirection are unknown because he was killed in the ensuing battle. In response to the order, Lucan instructed Cardigan to lead his command of about 670 troopers of the Light Brigade straight into the valley between the Fedyukhin Heights and the Causeway Heights. (Russell's report in The Times recorded that just short of 200 men were sick or for other reasons left behind in camp on the day, leaving \"607 sabres\" to take part in the charge.) In his poem, \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (1854), Tennyson dubbed this hollow \"The Valley of Death\". The opposing Russian forces were commanded by Pavel Liprandi. In Italian cinema, giallo (Italian: [ˈdʒallo]; pl.: gialli; from giallo, lit. 'yellow') is a genre of murder mystery fiction that often contains slasher, thriller, psychological horror, psychological thriller, sexploitation, and, less frequently, supernatural horror elements. This particular style of Italian-produced murder mystery horror-thriller film usually blends the atmosphere and suspense of thriller fiction with elements of horror fiction (such as slasher violence) and eroticism (similar to the French fantastique genre), and often involves a mysterious killer whose identity is not revealed until the final act of the film. The genre developed in the mid-to-late 1960s, peaked in popularity during the 1970s, and subsequently declined in commercial mainstream filmmaking over the next few decades, though examples continue to be produced. It was a predecessor to, and had significant influence on, the later American slasher film genre.    Literature  In the Italian language, giallo is a genre of novel including any literary genre involving crime and mystery, with all its sub-genres such as crime fiction, detective story, murder mystery, or thriller-horror.  The term giallo (\"yellow\") derives from a series of crime-mystery pulp novels entitled Il Giallo Mondadori (Mondadori Yellow), published by Mondadori from 1929 and taking its name from the trademark yellow cover background. The series consisted almost exclusively of Italian translations of mystery novels by British and American writers. These included Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Edgar Wallace, Ed McBain, Rex Stout, Edgar Allan Poe, and Raymond Chandler. Published as cheap paperbacks, the success of the giallo novels soon began attracting the attention of other Italian publishing houses. They published their own versions and mimicked the yellow covers. The popularity of these series eventually established the word giallo as a synonym in Italian for a mystery novel. In colloquial and media usage in Italy, it also applied to a mysterious or unsolved affair.    Film  In the film context, for Italian audiences giallo refers to any kind of murder mystery or horror thriller, regardless of its national origin. Meanwhile, English-speaking audiences have used the term giallo to refer specifically to a genre of Italian-produced thriller-horror films known to Italian audiences as giallo all'italiana. In the English-speaking world, Italian giallo films are also sometimes referred to as spaghetti thrillers or spaghetti slashers, in a similar manner to how Italian Western films and poliziotteschi films from the same period have been referred to as spaghetti Westerns and spaghetti crime films, respectively. The Italian film subgenre began as literal adaptations of the original giallo mystery novels (see Giallo (1933 film)). Directors soon began taking advantage of modern cinematic techniques to create a unique genre that retained the mystery and crime fiction elements of giallo novels but veered more closely into the psychological thriller or psychological horror genres. Many of the typical characteristics of these films were incorporated into the later American slasher genre.    Characteristics   Most critics agree that the giallo represents a distinct category with unique features, but there is some disagreement on what exactly defines a giallo film. Gary Needham wrote:  By its very nature, the giallo challenges our assumptions about how non-Hollywood films should be classified, going beyond the sort of Anglo-American taxonomic imaginary that \"fixes\" genre both in film criticism and the film industry in order to designate something specific. ... however, despite the giallo's resistance to clear definition, there are nevertheless identifiable thematic and stylistic tropes. These distinct \"thematic and stylistic tropes\" constitute a loose definition of the genre which is broadly consistent, though various critics have proposed slightly differing characteristic details (which consequently creates some confusion over which films can be considered gialli). Author Michael Mackenzie has written that gialli can be divided into the male-focused m. gialli, which usually sees a male outsider witness a murder and become the target of the killer when he attempts to solve the crime; and f. gialli, which features a female protagonist who is embroiled in a more sexual and psychological story, typically focusing on her sexuality, psyche, and fragile mental state. Although they often involve crime and detective work, gialli should not be confused with the other popular Italian crime genre of the 1970s, the poliziotteschi, which includes more action-oriented films about violent law enforcement officers (largely influenced by gritty American films such as Bullitt, Dirty Harry, Death Wish, The Godfather, Serpico, and The French Connection). Directors and actors often moved between both genres and there is some overlap between them. Danger: Diabolik  is a 1968 action film directed and co-written by Mario Bava, based on the Italian comic series \"Diabolik\" by Angela and Luciana Giussani. The film is about a criminal named Diabolik (John Phillip Law), who plans large-scale heists for his girlfriend Eva Kant (Marisa Mell). Diabolik is pursued by Inspector Ginko (Michel Piccoli), who blackmails the gangster Ralph Valmont (Adolfo Celi) into catching Diabolik for him. An adaptation of the comics was originally envisioned by producer Tonino Cervi, who hired director Seth Holt and began producing the film as an international co-production with a cast that included Jean Sorel, Elsa Martinelli and Gilbert Roland. Appalled with the quality of the footage that had been shot, distributor Dino De Laurentiis took over production duties and restarted filming from scratch. Working from a new screenplay and under creative pressure from De Laurentiis, Bava directed the film on a reduced budget, with established actors taking smaller roles. The film was produced in tandem with De Laurentiis' other comic book adaptation of that year, \"Barbarella\", with both films sharing several cast and crew members. Upon its theatrical release, \"Danger: Diabolik\" performed below De Laurentiis' expectations at the box office, and received negative reviews from \"The New York Times\" and \"Variety\". With the re-evaluation of Bava's filmography, retrospective reception of the film has been more positive, with critics praising its visuals, the performances of Law and Mell, and the score by Ennio Morricone. In 2008, it was chosen by \"Empire\" magazine as one of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". A new adaptation of \"Diabolik\" by the Manetti Bros. was announced in 2018. Danger: Diabolik (Italian: Diabolik) is a 1968 action and crime film directed and co-written by Mario Bava, based on the Italian comic series Diabolik by Angela and Luciana Giussani. The film is about a criminal named Diabolik (John Phillip Law), who plans large-scale heists for his girlfriend Eva Kant (Marisa Mell). Diabolik is pursued by Inspector Ginko (Michel Piccoli), who blackmails the gangster Ralph Valmont (Adolfo Celi) into catching Diabolik for him. An adaptation of the comics was originally envisioned by producer Tonino Cervi, who set up an international co-production deal in 1965 and hired Seth Holt to direct the film with a cast that included Jean Sorel, Elsa Martinelli and Gilbert Roland. Appalled with Holt's footage, distributor Dino De Laurentiis assumed control of the film's production, electing to restart the project from scratch with a new screenplay and Bava as director. De Laurentiis produced the film in tandem with another comic book adaptation, Barbarella, with the two projects receiving financial support from Paramount Pictures and sharing several cast and crew members. Catherine Deneuve was initially cast as Eva, but her incompatibility with Law and disagreements with Bava led to the part being recast with Mell. Working under more financial and creative pressure than he was familiar with, Bava delivered Danger: Diabolik considerably below its assigned budget by utilizing many of the inexpensive visual effects techniques that he had used in his earlier films; it would prove to be the only film that he would direct for a major Hollywood studio. Upon its theatrical release, Danger: Diabolik performed below De Laurentiis' expectations at the box office, and received negative reviews from The New York Times and Variety. With the re-evaluation of Bava's filmography, retrospective reception of the film has been more positive, with its visuals, the performances of Law and Mell, and the score by Ennio Morricone receiving praise. In studies of the film, critics and historians have focused on Bava's use of mise-en-scène to replicate the imagery and stylization of comic books, and the film's reflection of the socio-political upheavals of the 1960s in its characterization and narratology. Having garnered a cult following, Danger: Diabolik was chosen by Empire magazine as one of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\" in 2008. The first in a trilogy of new Diabolik films directed by the Manetti Bros. was released in 2021.    Plot  In an unidentified European country, Police Inspector Ginko oversees the transportation of $10 million from a bank. To prevent the master thief Diabolik from stealing the money, he creates a diversion whereby a truck from the bank transports wastepaper, while a team of himself and disguised officers take the money in a Rolls-Royce. The plan is still foiled by Diabolik, who escapes with the money and his lover Eva Kant to their underground hideout, where they have sex on top of their loot. Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior, who reinstates the death penalty to dissuade criminals such as themselves; they disrupt the conference by releasing exhilarating gas into the crowd. Unable to locate Diabolik, Ginko and his fellow officers are granted emergency privileges that allow them to crack down on the activities of gangster Ralph Valmont, who they hope will aid in capturing him. Realizing their plan after a teen discotheque he operates is raided due to it being a front for his drug trafficking operations, Valmont makes a deal with Ginko. While watching a news report, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Château de Saint-Just for Eva's birthday. After learning of Eva's features from a prostitute who spotted her scouting the castle, Valmont builds and circulates an identikit image of her. Diabolik scales the castle's sheer walls as the police lie in wait, and steals the necklace. Driving on his getaway, he and Eva fool the police by pulling a mirrored film across the road and using dummy decoys of himself; Eva is injured while setting up the film. While visiting her private doctor, Eva is recognized from the identikit image and abducted. To rescue her, Diabolik boards Valmont's airplane with the stolen $10 million and the necklace to trade for Eva. He is ejected from the plane, but manages to grab Valmont just before a bomb he had planted earlier explodes. Diabolik rescues Eva as Ginko and the police close in on them. Eva makes her escape, while Diabolik loads a gun magazine with the emeralds and fires them at Valmont, killing him. He then seemingly commits suicide by taking a mysterious capsule. Charge!! is the fourth studio album by American comedy rock band The Aquabats, released on June 7, 2005 by Nitro Records. Following a nearly six year semi-hiatus which resulted in numerous line-up changes, Charge!! was The Aquabats' first studio album to showcase the band's radical shift in sound, featuring a reduced five-member line-up and a reinvented musical style of new wave-influenced rock and punk music. Released to largely positive reviews and several successful international tours, Charge!! effectively revitalized The Aquabats' then-stalling career into the new century.    Overview  Following their dismissal from Goldenvoice Records in 2000, The Aquabats entered a lengthy period of relative inactivity, bringing much of their touring and recording plans to a standstill and resulting in the eventual departure of several of the band's key members, including the loss of their once prominent horn section. In 2004, The Aquabats independently released the EP Yo! Check Out This Ride! in an attempt to generate label interest, successfully signing to Nitro Records later in the year and commencing work on a new studio album in the fall. Despite this fortuitous turn of events, the band were still uncertain of their future following their semi-hiatus and radical shift in line-up. Singer Christian Jacobs (The MC Bat Commander) later commented that the band thought Charge! would possibly be their final album together. While the lyricism of Charge!! continues in the typical Aquabats tradition of comedic self-referential narratives and pop culture and geek culture-oriented satire, the music introduced a bold new sound for the band, featuring a predominant focus on guitar and keyboard-driven rock, punk and Devo-influenced new wave rather than the ska-driven eclecticism of their earlier albums. Notably, Charge!! was the first Aquabats studio album not to feature brass instruments, indeed one of the most remarked upon aspects of the album by reviewers; in a 2006 interview, Jacobs stated that the band attempted to write a saxophone solo into one of the album's songs but ultimately felt it sounded too out of place. Up until his return to the band in 2024 for their album Finally!, Charge! would be the last Aquabats album to feature longtime guitarist Corey Pollock (Chainsaw) as an official member, as he would eventually leave the band in 2006 as a result of their increased touring activity interfering with his day job. However, Pollock continued to frequently perform with the band live as a second guitarist and contributed guitar tracks to nearly all of their subsequent studio material.    Release and promotion  On April 1, 2005, Charge!! was announced for release in two months' time. Alongside this, the album's track listing and artwork, and an MP3 of \"Fashion Zombies\" was posted online. They offered a contest that whoever could get their local radio station to play the song would win an all expenses paid dinner with The Aquabats. The prize was claimed after a fan got the song airtime on Los Angeles' KROQ-FM and was taken to a T.G.I. Friday's. Charge!! planned for release on June 14, 2005 through Nitro Records, before it was released a week earlier on June 7. It charted modestly upon release, reaching #21 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers. Copies of the album were packaged with Aquabats trading cards featuring pictures of the band and song lyrics. Although the cards were produced in sets of thirteen, each CD came with only two, with an insert humorously instructing fans to buy more CDs in order to collect them all. In promotion of the album, the music video for \"Fashion Zombies!\" was released online on July 13, 2005, and on September 23, 2005, The Aquabats made their debut appearance on national television on the G4 program Attack of the Show, performing \"Fashion Zombies!\" and \"Nerd Alert!\".    Touring  In June and July 2005, the Aquabats embarked on a twelve-week tour of the US, dubbed the Teenage Pajamas From Outer Space tour, which was supported by the Epoxies and the Phenomenauts. Following this, they toured in August 2005 with the Eyeliners, the Phenomenauts and Time Again. In October 2005, they supported the Offspring for nine shows in Japan, which was followed by the Good to Go Tour in the UK with Never Heard of It, Army of Freshmen and Sonic Boom Six. In December 2005, the band played a short series of holiday shows with Valient Thorr and Goons of Doom.

Born in Rome, Bava began working as an assistant director for his director father Mario Bava. Lamberto co-directed the 1979 television film La Venere d'Ille with his father and in 1980 directed his first solo feature film Macabre. Bava continued working in the 1980s and collaborated with Dario Argento on films such as Demons. After 1990, Bava's work was predominantly involved with television, such as his Fantaghirò series.    Biography  Lamberto Bava was born in Rome, Italy on 3 April 1944. Lamberto's father Mario Bava was a film director known primarily as a director of horror films. Lamberto's film career began in the mid-1960s working as an assistant director on his father's film Planet of the Vampires. Lamberto would later collaborate with his father on several of his projects, including Danger: Diabolik (1966), Twitch of the Death Nerve (1971) and Shock (1977) (On Shock, Lamberto Bava was credited as a screenwriter as well as an assistant director.) Besides the work he did with his father, Lamberto also contributed to making films with Italian director Ruggero Deodato, such as Ultimo mondo cannibale (1977) and Cannibal Holocaust (1979). In 1978, Lamberto and Mario directed an episode of the Italian television series I giochi del diavolo (Storie fantastiche dell'Ottocento) (transl. The Devil's Game - Fantastic Tales of the 1800), a television series with six stories based on 19th century fantastic literature. Their episode was based on La Venere d'Ille by Prosper Mérimée and broadcast on RAI 1 on March 27, 1981.    Early 1980s theatrical films  A meeting with director Pupi Avati led to Bava directing his own feature film Macabre in 1980 which was co-written with Pupi and Antonio Avati. The film stars Bernice Stegers as Jane, a woman who has an affair with a man (Stanko Molnar), who dies. After his death, Jane keeps his severed head in her refrigerator and performs erotic acts with it. seeing Macabre, Mario told him \"Now I can die in peace\". Mario actually died later in 1980. Following the release of Macabre, Lamberto Bava worked in advertising and continued to write stories for potential future film projects. He was approached by director Dario Argento to assist him with his giallo film Tenebre (1982), wherein Bava is credited as an assistant director. In 1983, Lamberto Bava directed his second feature film as a director, the giallo film A Blade in the Dark. A Blade in the Dark was originally developed as a television film shot in four 25-minute segments on a very low budget. The film stars Andrea Occhipinti as the music composer Bruno, a man who becomes involved in a series of murders while staying at a secluded villa. Bava's next two film projects were in different genres than his previous giallo and horror film output. Bava was given a script for Blastfighter, a film originally written as a remake of the Australian film Mad Max with the intention of giving it to director Lucio Fulci. Blastfighter starred Michael Sopkiw as Tiger, a detective who had been released from prison for shooting the man who killed his wife. Tiger moves into the woods with his daughter where he is terrorized by a group of thugs. Lamberto's next film, Monster Shark, was a science fiction film about a mutated shark that goes on a killing spree with two marine biologists attempting to track down the creature to stop it.    Late 1980s theatrical and television films  In 1985, Lamberto Bava reteamed with Dario Argento on the film Demons. Argento co-wrote and produced Bava's film about a theater showing invitation-only screenings of a horror film. In the theater's lobby, a young woman is scratched by a display in the lobby and transforms into a hideous creature who then attacks other audience members, spreading her demonic infection. The film was followed by the sequel Demons 2 in 1986 which had many of the same cast and crew members from Demons. Demons 2 features a television program which causes an outbreak of zombies in an apartment complex. Bava also made the television film Midnight Killer the same year. The film is about a series of murders which are similar to one that was committed 15 years prior, despite the fact that the murderer supposedly died in a fire. Bava makes a cameo in the film as a photographer at the beginning of the film. A series of fourteen films based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories was released between 1939 and 1946; British actors Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce portrayed Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively. The first two films in the series were produced by 20th Century-Fox and released in 1939. After these two films, Universal Pictures acquired the rights from the Doyle estate and produced a further twelve films. The films from Fox had large budgets, high production values and were set in the Victorian era. Universal updated the films settings to the then-present time of World War II with Holmes fighting the Nazis and produced them as B pictures with lower budgets. Both Rathbone and Bruce continued their roles when the series changed studios, as did Mary Gordon, who played the recurring character Mrs Hudson. During the 1970s, four of the Universal films fell into the public domain when the studio failed to renew their copyrights. These four films were restored and colourised. Some of the films in the series had become degraded over time, with some of the original negatives lost and others suffering from nitrate deterioration because of the unstable cellulose nitrate film. The UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the series, putting the films onto modern polyester film, in a process that was jointly paid for by UCLA, Warner Bros. and Hugh Hefner.    Background   In 1938, Basil Rathbone was cast as Sherlock Holmes for the 20th Century-Fox adaptation of The Hound of the Baskervilles; Nigel Bruce was chosen to play Dr. John Watson. Darryl F. Zanuck, Gregory Ratoff and Gene Markey made the choice of Rathbone as Holmes during a conversation at a party in Hollywood. Filming began on 29 December 1938 under the direction of Sidney Lanfield and the film was released on 31 March 1939. Later that year a second film, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, followed, which was based on Sherlock Holmes, an 1899 stage play written by William Gillette. Although Fox planned to make further Holmes films with Rathbone and Bruce, complications in negotiations between the studio and the estate of the character's creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, brought a premature end to the series; Fox's decision to withdraw from further productions was also because the Second World War meant that \"foreign agents and spies were much more typical and topical than the antiquated criminal activities of Moriarty and the like\". On 2 October 1939, a month after the release of Adventures, Rathbone and Bruce resumed their roles on radio, in The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with episodes written by Dennis Green and Anthony Boucher. Rathbone left the radio series in May 1946, while Bruce remained until 1947, with Tom Conway replacing Rathbone. In February 1942, following negotiations with the Doyle estate, Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the films and signed contracts with Rathbone and Bruce to continue their portrayals. Universal's deal—worth $300,000—was for seven years, and they purchased the rights to 21 stories in the canon in a contract that stipulated that the company had to make three films a year, of which two had to be adaptations of Doyle's stories. Universal was allowed to substantially revise the adaptations and modernise them, often to the point where little of the original story remained recognisable. Universal decided to update the stories to a Second World War setting, and the first film, Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror—based on Doyle's 1917 story \"His Last Bow\"—was updated to a Second World War setting, with Holmes attempting to capture a Nazi agent. Rathbone and Bruce both initially objected to updating the setting of the stories. The change of era for Holmes is explained in the opening titles, with a caption that informs viewers that Holmes is \"ageless, invincible and unchanging\", going on to say that he was \"solving significant problems of the present day\". While the Fox adaptations had high production values and larger budgets, the Universal films changed the approach of the series, and aimed \"simply to be entertaining 'B' pictures\". The second film produced by Universal, Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, was directed by Roy William Neill; he went on to direct the remaining ten films—and produce the final nine—in the Universal series. Rathbone became frustrated with the role of Holmes and left the series in 1946; he stated that his \"first picture was, as it were, a negative from which I merely continued to produce endless positives of the same photograph\". Universal considered replacing him on screen with Tom Conway—as they subsequently did with the radio series—but instead decided to end the series, despite still having the rights for the next three years. Me or ME usually refers to: Me, M.E. or ME may also refer to: The mass-to-charge ratio (m/Q) is a physical quantity relating the mass (quantity of matter) and the electric charge of a given particle, expressed in units of kilograms per coulomb (kg/C). It is most widely used in the electrodynamics of charged particles, e.g. in electron optics and ion optics. It appears in the scientific fields of electron microscopy, cathode ray tubes, accelerator physics, nuclear physics, Auger electron spectroscopy, cosmology and mass spectrometry.  The importance of the mass-to-charge ratio, according to classical electrodynamics, is that two particles with the same mass-to-charge ratio move in the same path in a vacuum, when subjected to the same electric and magnetic fields. Some disciplines use the charge-to-mass ratio (Q/m) instead, which is the multiplicative inverse of the mass-to-charge ratio.  The CODATA recommended value for an electron is ⁠Q/m⁠  −1.75882000838(55)×1011 C⋅kg−1.‍    Origin  When charged particles move in electric and magnetic fields the following two laws apply:  Lorentz force law:                                    F                           Q         (                    E                  +                    v                  ×                    B                  )         ,                 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} Q(\\mathbf {E} +\\mathbf {v} \\times \\mathbf {B} ),}     Newton's second law of motion:                                   F                           m                    a                           m                                                                 d                                               v                                                                         d                              t                                                  {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} m\\mathbf {a} m{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {v} }{\\mathrm {d} t}}}     where F is the force applied to the ion, m is the mass of the particle, a is the acceleration, Q is the electric charge, E is the electric field, and v × B is the cross product of the ion's velocity and the magnetic flux density. This differential equation is the classic equation of motion for charged particles. Together with the particle's initial conditions, it completely determines the particle's motion in space and time in terms of m/Q. Thus mass spectrometers could be thought of as \"mass-to-charge spectrometers\". When presenting data in a mass spectrum, it is common to use the dimensionless m/z, which denotes the dimensionless quantity formed by dividing the mass number of the ion by its charge number. Combining the two previous equations yields:                                    (                                       m               Q                                   )                             a                                      E                  +                    v                  ×                    B                  .                 {\\displaystyle \\left({\\frac {m}{Q}}\\right)\\mathbf {a} \\mathbf {E} +\\mathbf {v} \\times \\mathbf {B} .}     This differential equation is the classic equation of motion of a charged particle in a vacuum. Together with the particle's initial conditions, it determines the particle's motion in space and time.  It immediately reveals that two particles with the same m/Q ratio behave in the same way. This is why the mass-to-charge ratio is an important physical quantity in those scientific fields where charged particles interact with magnetic or electric fields.    Exceptions  There are non-classical effects that derive from quantum mechanics, such as the Stern–Gerlach effect that can diverge the path of ions of identical m/Q.    Symbols and units  The IUPAC-recommended symbols for mass and charge are m and Q, respectively, however using a lowercase q for charge is also very common. Charge is a scalar property, meaning that it can be either positive (+) or negative (−). The Coulomb (C) is the SI unit of charge; however, other units can be used, such as expressing charge in terms of the elementary charge (e). The SI unit of the physical quantity m/Q is kilogram per coulomb.    Mass spectrometry and m/z   The units and notation above are used when dealing with the physics of mass spectrometry; however, the m/z notation is used for the independent variable in a mass spectrum. This notation eases data interpretation since it is numerically more related to the dalton. For example, if an ion carries one charge the m/z is numerically equivalent to the molecular or atomic mass of the ion in daltons (Da), where the numerical value of m/Q is abstruse. Charge It is a 1921 American silent drama film directed by Harry Garson and starring Clara Kimball Young. Shock (Italian: Schock) is a 1977 Italian supernatural horror film directed by Mario Bava and starring Daria Nicolodi, John Steiner, and David Colin, Jr. Its plot focuses on a woman who moves into the home she shared with her deceased former husband, where she finds herself tormented by supernatural occurrences. It was Bava's last theatrical feature before he died of a heart attack in 1980. In the United States, the film was released under the title Beyond the Door II as an unofficial sequel to Beyond the Door (1974) and second entry into the Beyond the Door trilogy.    Plot  Dora Baldini, her seven-year-old son Marco, and her new husband Bruno Baldini move into Dora's former home, where she lived during her first marriage to a man named Carlo. While Dora was pregnant with Marco, Carlo, an abusive heroin addict, was thought to have committed suicide at sea after his boat was found adrift. The incident resulted in Dora having a nervous breakdown and being placed in psychiatric care. With Bruno away as a commercial airline pilot, Dora is left all alone with Marco and only her shattered memory of the events of her former husband's death, caused by extensive electroshock treatment she received while institutionalized. Marco experiences various strange occurrences in the home and is inexplicably drawn to the home's basement. Dora notices bizarre changes in Marco's personality and is disturbed to find he has shredded her underwear. Unnerved by Marco's behavior and other frightening occurrences, Dora pleads with Bruno that they move out of the house, but he ignores her. While Bruno is on a flight, Dora finds a bundle of roses with a note addressed to her from Carlo. Suspecting Marco wrote it as a twisted joke, she confronts him and slaps him in the face when he denies writing it. Dora brings Marco to her psychologist friend, Aldo Spidini, for examination. Aldo suggests that Dora's trauma from her marriage to Carlo may be triggering her to project feelings of spite or anger on Marco, though she confesses that she feels that Marco is being possessed by his deceased father. One afternoon, Dora finds the piano playing by itself and witnesses drawings in Marco's room begin levitating but cannot find Marco. She eventually comes upon him in the den, and he asks her why she killed his father. This triggers a repressed memory, in which Dora recounts how she slit Carlo's throat with a boxcutter after he forcibly injected her with heroin and LSD. Distraught over the recollection, Dora is assured by Bruno that Carlo killed himself and that her memory is only a delusion. Still, she remains steadfast that Carlo is haunting the home and possessing Marco. Dora awakens in the middle of the night from a nightmare to banging noises emanating from the basement. She investigates the noises and finds Bruno smashing down a brick wall. Realizing Carlo's corpse has been hidden behind the wall, Bruno tells Dora that she called him for help after murdering Carlo seven years ago. Wanting to save her from prison, Bruno hid Carlo's body in the house and released his boat to sea, staging his disappearance as a possible suicide. Bruno explains that they had to return to the home so that Carlo's remains wouldn't have been discovered, which would have happened had they sold it; he then tells her once he has transferred the remains elsewhere, they can leave. In an abrupt but frenetic blind rage, Dora swings a pickaxe at Bruno, impaling him in the chest and subsequently stuffs his corpse in the open wall along with Carlo's. Dora runs upstairs to search for Marco but finds a ghoulish apparition of Carlo lying in his bed. Then in the hallway, Marco subsequently appears and starts running towards her but suddenly transforms into Carlo as he embraces her, causing Dora to scream with terror. Dora tries to flee from the house but encounters violent poltergeist activity that prevents her from doing so. She returns to the basement, where all the furniture in the house moves toward her and she finally slashes her own throat with a boxcutter while Carlo's hand is holding the knife. Outside later, Marco sits at a table in the backyard, having tea with his father's invisible ghost. He then proceeds to push the ghost on the tree swing.    Cast  Daria Nicolodi as Dora Baldini John Steiner as Bruno Baldini David Colin Jr. as Marco Ivan Rassimov as Dr. Aldo Spidini Nicola Salerno as Carlo (uncredited)    Production  Following a series of failed ventures or incomplete works such as Rabid Dogs and Baby Kong, Mario Bava's son Lamberto Bava continued to push his father into making new film work, which led to the creation of Shock. \"It Wasn't Me\" is the first single from Jamaican-American reggae musician Shaggy's fifth studio album, Hot Shot (2000). The song features vocals from British-Jamaican singer RikRok (credited as Ricardo \"RikRok\" Ducent). The lyrics of the song depict one man (portrayed by RikRok) asking his friend (portrayed by Shaggy) what to do after his girlfriend caught him cheating on her with \"the girl next door\". His friend/Shaggy's character's advice is to deny everything, despite clear evidence to the contrary, with the phrase \"It wasn't me.\" \"It Wasn't Me\" was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on 7 November 2000 and has been regarded as Shaggy's breakthrough in the pop market. It is his highest-charting song to date, topping the charts in Australia, Flanders, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It was the best-selling single of 2001 in the UK, selling over 1.15 million copies that year and over 1.42 million as of 2017.    Background  The lyrics of \"It Wasn't Me\" depict one man asking his friend what to do after his girlfriend catches him having sex with another woman. His friend's advice is to deny everything, despite clear evidence to the contrary, with the phrase \"It wasn't me.\" Ultimately, the narrator says that the advice \"makes no sense at all\" and decides to confess and apologize. It is written in the key of C major.  The song was inspired by a bit called \"No Loyal Men,\" performed by Eddie Murphy in his comedy special Raw (1987). In an interview in February 2016, Shaggy acknowledged an interpolation of the War song \"Smile Happy\". The connection is further supported by two later songs that are based on \"It Wasn't Me\": British singer Liam Payne's 2017 debut single \"Strip That Down\", which interpolates the song, and the 2019 song \"China\" by Puerto Rican rappers Anuel AA and Daddy Yankee and Colombian singer Karol G with Puerto Rican singer Ozuna and Colombian singer J Balvin, which samples the song. Both of these songs credited Shaggy (as Orville Burrell), the others writers of \"It Wasn't Me\", and members of War (despite their song not appearing on either track) as co-songwriters. The clean version of the song replaces the lyric \"Picture this: we were both butt-naked banging on the bathroom floor\" with \"Picture this: we were both caught making love on the bathroom floor\" and \"Saw me banging on the sofa\" with \"Saw me kissing on the sofa\". \"It Wasn't Me\" was originally never intended to be released as a single. Before the original version of Hot Shot was released in August 2000, Hawaiian DJ Pablo Sato downloaded the album from \"a Napster like MP3 site he won't name\" and discovered that \"It Wasn't Me\" was \"the album's standout cut.\" He played the song on American radio the next day, and in an interview, claimed, \"The phone lines lit up right away. Within a couple of days, it was our number-one requested song.\" The song was released to radio on 7 November 2000, then was given a retail release on 6 February 2001 following its airplay success.    Chart performance  \"It Wasn't Me\" was Shaggy's first number-one hit in the United States. The song reached number two on 23 December 2000. On 30 December, it was bumped down one position to number three. It moved back up to the number-two spot on 13 January 2001, then, on 3 February, it ascended to number one, replacing Destiny's Child's \"Independent Women Part I\". The song remained at number one for two weeks and spent 25 weeks on the chart altogether. The song also reached number one on the UK Singles Chart on 4 March 2001, selling 345,000 copies, making the song a transatlantic chart topper. It also reached number one in Australia on 1 April 2001. It is also the 11th biggest selling single of the 21st century in the United Kingdom, with sales of over 1.42 million as of September 2017. As of August 2014, it is the 49th-best-selling single of the 21st century in France, with 399,500 units sold.    Music video  The music video was directed by Stephen Scott. It begins with RikRok running to Shaggy's mansion to explain to him what has just happened. RikRok tells him that he cheated on his girlfriend and got caught. Diabolik is a 2021 Italian crime action film directed by the Manetti Bros. and based on the comic series of the same name. It is the second film adaptation of Diabolik, after Mario Bava's Danger: Diabolik (1968).\nThe film premiered at the Noir in Festival on 15 December 2021, and was released theatrically in Italy the following day by 01 Distribution. It is followed by two sequels: Diabolik: Ginko Attacks! (2022) and Diabolik: Who Are You? (2023).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nLegendary thief Diabolik plans his next heist: stealing a valuable diamond from heiress Eva Kant, who is dating the deputy minister of justice, Giorgio Caron. Using one of his trademark masks to impersonate his nemesis, Inspector Ginko, Diabolik tricks Eva into revealing which hotel she will be staying at. He makes another mask to pose as one of the wait staff assigned to her room, and quickly locates the hidden safe where the diamond is kept. However, upon seeing Eva, he becomes infatuated with her.\nDiabolik sneaks into Eva's room to steal the diamond, but Eva walks in on him, and he has no choice but to hold her at knifepoint. Eva calmly reveals that she doesn't have the diamond, having already sold it to a dealer in South Africa, and Diabolik leaves. The next day, he returns and unmasks himself in front of Eva; disgusted by the lecherous Giorgio, she starts an affair with him. Unbeknownst to Diabolik, his girlfriend Elisabeth, from whom he has hidden the truth about who he really is, accidentally uncovers his secret hideout. Ginko is notified and arranges a sting operation, resulting in Diabolik's arrest.\nAt trial, Diabolik is convicted and sentenced to be beheaded via guillotine. When Eva learns of his fate, she has Giorgio use his influence to arrange a clandestine meeting in Diabolik's cell. Once the guards leave, Eva incapacitates Giorgio and Diabolik questions him to learn where he is keeping a file containing information as to Eva's unsavory past, which he had been using to blackmail her. He then dons a mask of Giorgio's face and puts on his clothes to escape, while a drugged Giorgio is fitted with a Diabolik mask and executed in his place. Ginko figures out the deception in time to stop Diabolik from retrieving the file; one of his officers finds it instead.\nNeeding money to flee the country, Diabolik targets a bank holding expensive jewelry and watches. He has Eva impersonate a rich widow named Ms. Morel to rent a vault. This enables her to learn about the bank's security features so Diabolik can figure out how to bypass them by flooding the bank and using diving equipment to steal the jewels and watches. Ginko, using his knowledge of Diabolik's modus operandi, is able to determine his escape route and briefly holds him at gunpoint before Eva distracts him and he is overpowered by Diabolik. The two make their getaway on a motorboat while Ginko can only watch in defeat.\nSometime later, Diabolik and Eva are on a yacht. To cement their new partnership, he presents her with the diamond, but Eva throws it into the ocean, affirming that she no longer wants to be burdened by her past.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Release ==\nDiabolik premiered as the closing film of the 31st Noir in Festival on 15 December 2021, and was released theatrically in Italy the following day by 01 Distribution. It was originally set to be released on 31 December 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.\nThe film was released digitally in Canada on 20 May 2022 by Mongrel Media. In February 2023, Kino Lorber acquired the rights to the Diabolik trilogy in the United States.\n\n\n== Sequels ==\nIn April 2021, 01 Distribution announced two sequels to Diabolik, which began filming that October. The first sequel, titled Diabolik: Ginko Attacks!, was released on 17 November 2022, also directed by the Manetti Bros. Leone and Mastandrea reprise their roles in the sequel, with Giacomo Gianniotti replacing Marinelli as Diabolik. The third and final instalment in the trilogy, Diabolik: Who Are You?, was released on 30 November 2023.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDiabolik at IMDb\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

The Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio is a historic house and design studio in Oak Park, Illinois, which was designed and owned by architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  First built in 1889 and added to over the years, the home and studio is furnished with original Wright-designed furniture and textiles. It has been restored by the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust to its appearance in 1909, the last year Wright lived there with his family. Here, Wright worked on his career and aesthetic in becoming one of the most influential architects of the 20th century. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, declared a National Historic Landmark four years later, and contributes to the Frank Lloyd Wright–Prairie School of Architecture Historic District containing a number of his projects and related work.    History  Located in Oak Park, Illinois, Frank Lloyd Wright was 22 years old when he purchased the property and built the home in 1889 with a $5,000 loan from his employer Louis Sullivan. Wright had just married 18 year old Catherine Tobin. The Wrights raised six children in the home.  The original 1889 structure was quite small. In 1895, the home was extensively remodeled, when among other changes the kitchen was enlarged and converted to a dining room, the upstairs nursery was expanded and converted for use as Wrights wife Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin's dayroom, and the Children's Playroom and a new kitchen were added to the back of the house. From 1890 to 1895 Wright and his wife had 4 of their altogether 6 children: Frank Lloyd Wright Jr.(1890), John Lloyd Wright (1892), Catherine Wright (1894), David Samuel Wright (1895) followed by Frances Wright Caroe (1898) and Robert Llwellyn Wright (1903). In 1898, a second major addition was made, when the Studio and Connecting Corridor were built. In the Studio, Frank Lloyd Wright and associated architects like Walter Burley Griffin and sculptor Richard Bock advanced the Prairie School of Architecture and designed many notable structures, including the Robie House, Unity Temple, the Laura Gale home, and the Larkin building. After 1909, Wright converted the Studio into a residence for his wife and the younger children. Later on, the Home and Studio became an apartment building. In the 1960s it fell into disrepair as the owners began to neglect the property due to financial problems. During this time they also made some parts of the property available for public tours. The longtime roofing company entrusted by Frank Lloyd Wright, Oak Park-based Tuscher Roofing, took control of the property. In 1974, the structure was handed over to the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the 13-year restoration began. In 1976, the Home and Studio was declared a National Historic Landmark. It is owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and has been restored, maintained, and operated as a museum by The Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust. Every May, the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust hosts a housewalk of the home and studio and various private homes. Frank Lloyd Wright's Home and Studio is located in one of three historic districts of Oak Park, Illinois. It is specifically found in the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District, which includes 27 Wright-designed structures as well as other historical and architecturally significant buildings.    Architectural principles  In his first house Wright realized his ideal of an open living space: there is no door between hallway and living room. The family was supposed to live together, though in practice he rather withdrew to his drawing room. Technologically the house was cutting edge with electricity and telephone. The playroom was the most beautiful room; this has been interpreted that the architect gave his children what he was unable to give as a father or \"at heart he was the 7th child of the family\".    Sculptures  Most of the sculptures on the exterior of the Home and studio were designed by Wright's friend and collaborator, Richard Bock. These include the two boulder figures flanking the entrance of the studio, which features a man crouching and breaking free from the ground beneath him. Bock also designed the stork capitals on the exterior loggia of the studio. The capitals signifies the tree of life, the book of knowledge, an architectural scroll, and two storks full of wisdom and fertility. Wright's home included many sculptures on the interior which added to and contrasted with the anti-Victorian decor. Frank Lloyd Wright Sr. (June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American architect, designer, writer, and educator.  He designed more than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and mentoring hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship. Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture\". Wright was a pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture and also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City, his vision for urban planning in the United States. He also designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and other commercial projects. Wright-designed interior elements (including leaded glass windows, floors, furniture and even tableware) were integrated into these structures. He wrote several books and numerous articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as \"the greatest American architect of all time\". In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright. Raised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago, briefly with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, and then with Louis Sullivan at Adler & Sullivan.  Wright opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 and established a studio in his Oak Park, Illinois home in 1898. His fame increased and his personal life sometimes made headlines: leaving his first wife Catherine \"Kitty\" Tobin for Mamah Cheney  in 1909; the murder of Mamah and her children and others at his Taliesin estate by a staff member in 1914; his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel (m. 1923–1927); and his courtship and marriage with Olgivanna Lazović (m. 1928–1959).    Early life and education     Childhood (1867–1885)  Wright was born on June 8, 1867, in the town of Richland Center, Wisconsin, but maintained throughout his life that he was born in 1869. In 1987 a biographer of Wright suggested that he may have been christened as \"Frank Lincoln Wright\" or \"Franklin Lincoln Wright\" but these assertions were not supported by any evidence. Wright's father, William Cary Wright (1825–1904), was a \"gifted musician, orator, and sometime preacher who had been admitted to the bar in 1857.\" He was also a published composer. Originally from Massachusetts, William Wright had been a Baptist minister, but he later joined his wife's family in the Unitarian faith. Wright's mother, Anna Lloyd Jones (1838/39–1923) was a teacher and a member of the Lloyd Jones clan; her parents had emigrated from Wales to Wisconsin. One of Anna's brothers was Jenkin Lloyd Jones, an important figure in the spread of the Unitarian faith in the Midwest. According to Wright's autobiography, his mother declared when she was expecting that her first child would grow up to build beautiful buildings. She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition. Wright grew up in an \"unstable household, [...] constant lack of resources, [...] unrelieved poverty and anxiety\" and had a \"deeply disturbed and obviously unhappy childhood\".  His father held pastorates in McGregor, Iowa (1869), Pawtucket, Rhode Island (1871), and Weymouth, Massachusetts (1874). Because the Wright family struggled financially also in Weymouth, they returned to Spring Green, where the supportive Lloyd Jones family could help William find employment. In 1877, they settled in Madison, where William gave music lessons and served as the secretary to the newly formed Unitarian society. Although William was a distant parent, he shared his love of music with his children. In 1876, Anna saw an exhibit of educational blocks called the Froebel Gifts, the foundation of an innovative kindergarten curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which the 9-year old Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form two- and three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: \"For several years, I sat at the little kindergarten table-top... and played... The International Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005 (Subtitle D of Title VIII (Sections 831–834) of United States Public Law 109–162), or IMBRA, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1375a(d), is a United States federal statute that requires background checks for all marriage visa sponsors and limits serial visa applications.  Additionally, the law requires background checks for US citizens using marriage brokerage services focused primarily on providing dating services between US citizens or residents and foreign nationals for a fee.  The impetus for its introduction were the Susanna Blackwell case in 1995 and the Anastasia King case in 2000, in which foreign women had been abused and murdered by men who had used a K-1 fiancée visa issued by the U.S. State Department to bring them to the United States. In the King case, the husband had physically abused a previous foreign bride before murdering Anastasia.  King had met Anastasia through his own advertisement in a Moscow newspaper (not through an international marriage broker).  In the Blackwell case, the husband had a clean record, therefore IMBRA would not have prevented her murder.  It was intended to stop abuse of mail order brides by prospective husbands with criminal histories. IMBRA met with opposition from international dating companies when it was first introduced. Some industry executives claim the industry has grown to appreciate it to ensure the safety of its female clients. Executives from industry leader A Foreign Affair have remarked that these changes have been beneficial for men and women.    Key provisions     Marketing of children prohibited  International marriage brokers (IMBs) are prohibited from providing personal contact information, photographs, or other information about anyone under the age of 18 to any individual or entity (section 833(d)(1)).

An international marriage in Japan is a marriage between a Japanese and a non-Japanese person, in accordance with the formalities provided by the law of Japan or of a foreign land. Procedures and rules mentioned in this article are mainly those of Japan, but in some cases other requirements are imposed by the homeland of the non-Japanese spouse, or by the foreign land where the concerned couple marry. In general the legality of a marriage for each spouse is determined by the homeland law of the spouse.    History  Marriage between a Japanese national and a non-Japanese person was first officially permitted by act of law on March 14, 1873 (6th year of the Meiji Period), before the former Meiji Constitution (1889) and the former Nationality Law (1899). This day is informally known as International Marriage Day (国際結婚の日) and coincides with the modern White Day. International marriage at the time required both a permit and surrender of recognised social standing (分限). During 1986 to 1991, the period of Japanese bubble economy, labor shortages for \"3D jobs\" (dirty, dangerous, and demeaning) occurred in Japan. This situation created expand the migrant labor rates. However, the revised policy in 1990 prohibited unrestricted economic activities except for only four kinds of visa, which include the \"Spouse or child of a Japanese national\". This policy legalizes all kinds of economic activity for marriage migrations.    Homeland law  According to an Act of Japan on general rules,   The homeland law of a person is the law of the country of citizenship of the person. If a person has more than one citizenship, and if one of the citizenships is Japan, the homeland law is the law of Japan; If a person has more than one citizenship, and none of them is Japanese, the homeland law of the person is the law of the country where the person habitually lives. as to a concerned person with nationality of a nation in which laws are different according to locality (like the US), the homeland law is the local law under rules of the nation or, if the nation doesn't have such rules, the homeland law is the law of the local area which is most closely related to the person.    Required translation  Each paper, document mentioned in this article as required by Japan, if not written in Japanese, needs to be accompanied with translation into Japanese; one of the concerned persons can themself be the translator; their name must accompany the translation.    Legal documents  When a Japanese and a non-Japanese are intending to marry    in accordance with Japanese rules, homeland certification is required regarding the concerned non-Japanese that they are permitted to marry (see the related section below); in accordance with foreign law, certification by Japan may also be required.    Japanese regulations     Notification  If a couple including a Japanese citizen marry in Japan, the marriage is to be in accordance with Japanese law.  Thus Japan requires notification of the marriage.  Japan's diplomatic establishments abroad can not legally accept a notification of a marriage of this type.    Competence certification as to the concerned non-Japanese  Japan requires competence certification as to the concerned non-Japanese, as a paper in principle, to be submitted; if the homeland (state / nation) is one which doesn't issue this certification,   if he / she swears in the presence of the homeland's consul in Japan that he / she has legal competence under the homeland law to get married with a Japanese, the written oath signed by the consul might be the substitute for this certification paper; if even the substitutes can not be submitted, a copy of the homeland law on marriage with its source clarified, and identity certification(s) issued by the homeland's official institution(s) such as a passport, are required instead.    Family register  The fact the Japanese got married with the non-Japanese is to be recorded in a family register with the concerned Japanese written at its head; if the Japanese is one not written at the head, a new family register for the concerned couple is to be created.    Family name  While a rule of Japan for the common surname (i.e. family name) is not applied to the couple, the concerned Japanese can change his or her surname to that of the concerned non-Japanese spouse by filing notification as such.

Frank William George Lloyd (2 February 1886 – 10 August 1960) was a British-born American film director, actor, scriptwriter, and producer. He was among the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and was its president from 1934 to 1935. Frank William George Lloyd (2 February 1886 – 10 August 1960) was a Scottish-American film director, screenwriter, producer and actor. He was among the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and was its president from 1934 to 1935. He is Scotland's first Academy Award winner and is unique in film history, having received three Oscar nominations in 1929 for his work on a silent film (The Divine Lady), a part-talkie (Weary River) and a full talkie (Drag). He won for The Divine Lady. He was nominated and won again in 1933 for his adaptation of Noël Coward's Cavalcade and received a further Best Director nomination in 1935 for perhaps his most successful film, Mutiny on the Bounty. In 1957, he was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film. In 1960, Lloyd received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion pictures industry, at 6667 Hollywood Boulevard.    Early life and career  Lloyd was born in Cambuslang, on the outskirts of Glasgow, the youngest of seven children. His mother Jane was Scottish and his father Edmund Lloyd was Welsh, a mechanical engineer. The family travelled the country until his father was injured and gave up engineering. They settled in Shepherd's Bush, London, where the family ran a pub. Lloyd worked in a shoe shop, sang in choral groups and joined a vaudeville group. In 1909 he emigrated to Canada where he worked on a ranch in Alberta for a year. He also erected poles and wrote for a telephone company, then joined a travelling show as an actor and singer. The show wound up in Los Angeles in 1913 and Lloyd decided to stay there and act in Hollywood films.    Film director     Paramount  He began directing shorts for Paramount and moved to longer running films: The Gentleman from Indiana (1915), Jane (1915), The Reform Candidate (1916), The Tongues of Men (1916), The Call of the Cumberlands (1916), Madame la Presidente (1916) with Anna Held, The Code of Marcia Gray (1916), David Garrick (1916 film) (1916), The Making of Maddalena (1916), An International Marriage (1916), and The Stronger Love (1916). The Intrigue (1916) was produced through Pallas Films and released through Paramount.  Lloyd's biographer argued his early films \"are not 'masterpieces,' but they are on a par with films from other secondary directors of the period. In other words, they are not comparable to those directed by D.W. Griffith, but are as good as those directed by Allan Dwan.\"    Fox  Lloyd directed Sins of Her Parent (1916) at Fox, and The World and the Woman (1916) with Jeanne Eagles for Tranhouser. Back at Fox he did The Kingdom of Love (1917), and a series of films starring William Farnum\" The Price of Silence (1917), A Tale of Two Cities (1917) from the novel by Charles Dickens, American Methods (1917), When a Man Sees Red (1917), Les Misérables (1917), The Heart of a Lion (1917), True Blue (1918), Riders of the Purple Sage (1918) from the novel by Zane Grey and its sequel The Rainbow Trail (1918), For Freedom (1918), and The Man Hunter (1919). Without Farnum, Lloyd directed The Blindness of Divorce (1918).    Goldwyn  At Goldwyn he made Pitfalls of a Big City (1919),The World and Its Woman (1919), The Loves of Letty (1919), The Woman in Room 13 (1920), The Silver Horde (1920 film) (1920), Madame X (1920) with Pauline Frederick, The Great Lover (1920), A Tale of Two Worlds (1921), Roads of Destiny (1921) with Frederick, A Voice in the Dark (1921), The Invisible Power (1921), The Grim Comedian (1921), and The Man from Lost River (1921) plus The Sin Flood (1922) with Richard Dix.

Also for that studio was Oliver Twist (1922) with Lon Chaney and Jackie Coogan, and Black Oxen (1924). He had his own company at First National, Frank Lloyd Productions. Harry Wainwright( born 1899; date of death unknown) was an English footballer. A mail-order bride is a woman who lists herself in catalogs and is selected by a man for marriage. In the twentieth century, the trend primarily involved women living in developing countries seeking men from more developed nations. Men who list themselves in such publications are referred to as \"mail-order husbands\", although this is much less common. As of 2002, there were an estimated 100,000–150,000 mail order brides worldwide. The term mail-order bride has been criticized by international marriage agencies, who nevertheless continue to use it as an easily recognizable term. Women of Asian descent have also criticized the term, which they consider stigmatizing to women in such relationships. Consequently, some researchers have rejected the term.    Demographics  Around 100,000 to 150,000 women advertise themselves as mail-order brides globally. Of these, around 4,000 to 6,000 are married to American men every year, according to CIS estimates. More mail order brides originate from the Philippines than any other country, in spite of the illegality of mail order brides in the Philippines. According to Robert Scholes, in a sample of 6,000 mail order brides, 76% were of Asian origin, while 28% originated from former Soviet Union countries such as Russia and Ukraine. A smaller portion were from Latin America. The majority of the American men who married foreign wives were White, highly educated, and successful. Of the foreign brides given residence status in the United States in 2002, 50% were from East Asia (mainly China, Vietnam and the Philippines) 25% were from European countries (namely Russia and Ukraine), and 5% were from Latin America. Owing to the large number of single men in rural Japan, mail-order brides from the Philippines became common in the 1990s, and in 2006 the number of such marriages peaked at 12,150. Although the number of marriages has dropped to less than 4,000, Filipinas still make up the largest number of foreign brides in Japan. Due to the rising cost of paying for a bride in China, some Chinese men from working class communities have paid marriage brokers for wives from Vietnam, Laos or Cambodia. Although many of the women from Vietnam willingly marry for love or economic reasons, some are kidnapped and sold by human traffickers. According to China's Ministry of Public Security, 17,746 women were rescued from human traffickers in a period of less than two years.    Motivations     East and Southeast Asia  Many international brides come from developing countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia, and occasionally from South Asia as well. The countries the women come from are faced with unemployment, malnutrition and inflation. However, economic factors are not the only driving factor for women in Asia to enter the mail-order industry. In some cases women were recruited based on their physical appearance, with an emphasis placed on youth and virginity. This is found among boutique agencies, most of which cater to wealthy men from other Asian nations. During the 1990s, the majority of Asian mail-order brides came from the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Taiwan, Macau, South Korea, Hong Kong, and China. In 2022, Monica Liu published findings which question the common assumption that mail-order brides in East Asia are often seeking marriage to escape poverty. She found that many marriage agencies in China cater to women from wealthy backgrounds. Liu found that in many cases, wealthy Chinese women sought Western, especially White American partners, because they are stereotyped within China as being more masculine and better able to satisfy women's sexual and emotional needs. However, for the wealthiest Chinese women, the lower income of their foreign boyfriends was sometimes an impediment to marriage.  According to Ericka Johnson, in Taiwan, many Taiwanese men seek Southeast Asian women as mail-order wives because they prefer hard-working women who will accept the drudges of daily housewife chores, while Taiwanese women reject this traditional view of a woman's role in marriage. For this reason, Taiwanese women seek to marry Western mail-order husbands.    Philippines  Filipina women often entered the mail-order industry in the hope of marrying abroad, and then sponsoring their family for immigration.    Eastern Europe  Economic and social conditions for women in Russia and other Post-Soviet states are a motivational factor in finding foreign arrangements. The rise of Russian mail-order brides happened immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In testimony before the United States Senate, Professor Donna Hughes said that two thirds of Ukrainian women interviewed wanted to live abroad and this rose to 97% in the resort city of Yalta.    Russia  In 1999, it was reported that women in Russia earned 43 percent of what men did. Carl Haber( born 1956) is an American filmmaker and professor of film. Haber has had a career as a writer, director and producer in independent film. An American who has spent a good part of his life out of America, and married to a European, he is also a professor of film courses and has recently founded the Rome International Film School. William Thomas Smith( born 9 April 1897, date of death unknown) was an English professional footballer. Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a culturally and often legally recognised union between people called spouses. It establishes rights and obligations between them, as well as between them and their children (if any), and between them and their in-laws. It is nearly a cultural universal, but the definition of marriage varies between cultures and religions, and over time. Typically, it is an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually sexual, are acknowledged or sanctioned. In some cultures, marriage is recommended or considered to be compulsory before pursuing sexual activity. A marriage ceremony is called a wedding, while a private marriage is sometimes called an elopement. Around the world, there has been a general trend towards ensuring equal rights for women and ending discrimination and harassment against couples who are interethnic, interracial, interfaith, interdenominational, interclass, intercommunity, transnational, and same-sex as well as immigrant couples, couples with an immigrant spouse, and other minority couples. Debates persist regarding the legal status of married women, leniency towards violence within marriage, customs such as dowry and bride price, marriageable age, and criminalization of premarital and extramarital sex. Individuals may marry for several reasons, including legal, social, libidinal, emotional, financial, spiritual, cultural, economic, political, religious, sexual, and romantic purposes. In some areas of the world, arranged marriage, forced marriage, polygyny marriage, polyandry marriage, group marriage, coverture marriage, child marriage, cousin marriage, sibling marriage, teenage marriage, avunculate marriage, incestuous marriage, and bestiality marriage are practiced and legally permissible, while others areas outlaw them to protect human rights. Female age at marriage has proven to be a strong indicator for female autonomy and is continuously used by economic history research. Marriage can be recognized by a state, an organization, a religious authority, a tribal group, a local community, or peers. It is often viewed as a contract. A religious marriage ceremony is performed by a religious institution to recognize and create the rights and obligations intrinsic to matrimony in that religion. Religious marriage is known variously as sacramental marriage in Christianity (especially Catholicism), nikah in Islam, nissuin in Judaism, and various other names in other faith traditions, each with their own constraints as to what constitutes, and who can enter into, a valid religious marriage.    Etymology  The word \"marriage\" appeared around 1300 and likely descended from the Old French \"mariage\" of the 12th Century and the Vulgar Latin \"maritaticum\" of the 11th Century, ultimately tracing to the Latin \"maritatus\", past participle of \"maritare\". The adjective marīt-us -a, -um meaning matrimonial or nuptial could also be used in the masculine form as a noun for \"husband\" and in the feminine form for \"wife\". The related word \"matrimony\" derives from the Old French word matremoine, which appears around 1300 CE and ultimately derives from Latin mātrimōnium, which combines the two concepts: mater meaning \"mother\" and the suffix -monium signifying \"action, state, or condition\".    Definitions  Anthropologists have proposed several competing definitions of marriage in an attempt to encompass the wide variety of marital practices observed across cultures. Even within Western culture, \"definitions of marriage have careened from one extreme to another and everywhere in between\" (as Evan Gerstmann has put it).    Relation recognized by custom or law  In The History of Human Marriage (1891), Edvard Westermarck defined marriage as \"a more or less durable connection between male and female lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till after the birth of the offspring.\" In The Future of Marriage in Western Civilization (1936), he rejected his earlier definition, instead provisionally defining marriage as \"a relation of one or more men to one or more women that is recognized by custom or law\".    Legitimacy of offspring  The anthropological handbook Notes and Queries (1951) defined marriage as \"a union between a man and a woman such that children born to the woman are the recognized legitimate offspring of both partners.\" In recognition of a practice by the Nuer people of Sudan allowing women to act as a husband in certain circumstances (the ghost marriage), Kathleen Gough suggested modifying this to \"a woman and one or more other persons.\" In an analysis of marriage among the Nayar, a polyandrous society in India, Gough found that the group lacked a husband role in the conventional sense. The husband role, unitary in the west, was instead divided between a non-resident \"social father\" of the woman's children, and her lovers, who were the actual procreators. None of these men had legal rights to the woman's child. The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright is a UNESCO World Heritage Site consisting of a selection of eight buildings across the United States that were designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. These sites demonstrate his philosophy of organic architecture, designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment. Wright's work had an international influence on the development of architecture in the 20th century.\n\n\n== Frank Lloyd Wright ==\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959) was raised in rural Wisconsin and studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin.  He then apprenticed with noted architects in the Chicago school of architecture, particularly Louis Sullivan.  Wright opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893, and developed an influential home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In the 20th century, he became one of the most renowned architects in the world.\n\n\n== Nomination ==\nThrough efforts led by the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, a non profit organization, the collection was originally put on the World Heritage Tentative List in 2008 with ten of Wright's buildings. It then grew to 11 sites in 2011, but the S. C. Johnson & Son Inc. Administration Building and Research Tower in Racine, Wisconsin, was eventually removed. A 2015 bid for inscription was referred by UNESCO for revision in July 2016. The Conservancy led, Frank Lloyd Wright World Heritage Council, worked closely with the National Park Service and UNESCO to reconsider the original proposal and to make appropriate changes.\nIn December 2018, a revised proposal was submitted with eight buildings, excluding the Price Tower in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, and the Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael, California, from the proposal. In the following June, the International Council on Monuments and Sites gave a positive recommendation. The site was inscribed on the World Heritage list in July 2019.\n\n\n== World Heritage listing ==\nThe eight representative Wright buildings selected for the World Heritage Site were designed in the first half of the 20th century.  The first building included, Unity Temple (001), was completed in 1908. The last, The Guggenheim (008), was completed in 1959—the year Wright died—although its design began in the 1940s.\n\n\n== References ==\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

It is based on the 1999 French novel If Only It Were True (Et si c'était vrai...) by Marc Levy. Steven Spielberg obtained the rights to produce the film from the book. The film was released in the United States on September 16, 2005. Despite mixed reviews from critics, it grossed $102.9 million on a budget of $58 million.    Plot  Elizabeth Masterson, an emergency room physician in San Francisco whose work is everything, is in a car crash while on her way to a blind date at her sister's. Three months later, landscape architect David Abbott, needing a fresh start after his wife's death, takes a sublet on Elizabeth's apartment. Elizabeth begins to appear in the apartment, and both are confused. She thinks he is a squatter, and he thinks she broke in. They soon realize she moves through walls and objects. Elizabeth does not know who she is and insists she is not dead. David unsuccessfully tries to have her spirit exorcised. As only David can see and hear her, others think he is hallucinating and talking to himself. Elizabeth asks him to help her discover who she really is. David talks to her neighbors but they do not know her. David enlists the help of a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl, who says Elizabeth is not really dead. He also tells David he has clearly got a blocked heart and needs to let go of the woman who was previously in his life. When Elizabeth says he should get over being dumped, he storms out, and Darryl tells Elizabeth to not disrespect the dead. She finds David and he explains about the death of his wife. Checking a restaurant, she recognizes that a man has a medical emergency, so Elizabeth helps David save his life. Suddenly, she remembers being a doctor, and they go to the nearest hospital, where it all comes flooding back. Dr. Fran Lo, her mentor, takes him to Elizabeth,  who is in a coma. When David touches her hand, Elizabeth feels it, meaning she is still connected to her body. Elizabeth's sister Abby arrives, and Dr. Brett Rushton –  Elizabeth's rival –  notifies her that Elizabeth signed a DNR order. He asks her to sign off on disconnecting life support, and she says she will consider it. David and Elizabeth bond. When he takes her to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed, she tells him she senses she has been there before. In fact, she was dreaming of the garden (in the opening scenes of the film), while catnapping during a long shift. When David is told he has been offered a long-term lease, he realizes Elizabeth will be taken off life support. He tries to prevent it by going to Abby's to tell her that she is communicating with him. While there, Elizabeth discovers that her niece Lily can see her. David begs Abby to keep her alive, but she has already signed the papers, with life support ending the next day. As a last-ditch effort, David blurts out Abby's secret from her wedding day, freaking her out so she drives him out of her house. Elizabeth opts to spend her last night with David in the apartment. The next morning, he is determined to prevent her death by stealing her body from the hospital. He enlists his friend and therapist Jack to help. It turns out Jack is Abby's former college boyfriend, and the two had set up David and Elizabeth for a blind date on the night of the crash; David can see her because they were meant to meet. He admits to Jack and Elizabeth that he loves her. Security guards catch them trying to steal Elizabeth's body. As they pull Jack away from her, her breathing tube comes off. Elizabeth is now dying, and David frantically kisses her body, while her spirit fades away. Her heartbeat returns and she awakens from the coma. She recognizes Abby, but not David, and he sadly leaves. Sometime later, Elizabeth moves back into her apartment. Drawn to the roof, she finds David, who has transformed it into a landscaped garden. He reveals he had gotten in using the spare key her spirit had shown him. When Elizabeth asks for her key back, their hands touch, her memory of the events during her coma is restored, and they kiss happily. The final scene fades away from the rooftop to show Darryl staring into a snow globe, happy with \"seeing\" how things have turned out.

Plot   Tom Hansen is an aspiring architect who works as a writer at a greeting card company. He meets Summer Finn, a new employee. They discover that they have a similar taste in music. Later, at a karaoke night for their work, they talk about love. Tom believes in it, but Summer does not. Tom's friend and co-worker McKenzie drunkenly reveals that Tom likes Summer, which he asserts is only \"as friends\", something Summer agrees with. A few days later, Summer spontaneously kisses Tom in the office. Summer is not looking for a serious relationship. Tom agrees to a casual relationship. That night they have sex; Tom is elated.  Over the first several months of their relationship, they grow closer. Both Tom's friends and his preteen half-sister Rachel push him to ask Summer where they are in their relationship, though Summer brushes this off, saying that it should not matter if they are both happy. One night, Tom gets into a fight with a man who tries to pick Summer up in a bar, causing their first argument. They make up and Summer concedes Tom deserves some certainty, but demanding she promise to always feel the same way about him would be impossible for anyone to make. Slowly, their relationship becomes less passionate and they begin to continuously argue. Summer quits the greeting card company and breaks up with Tom, citing their obvious unhappiness. Tom's boss moves him to the consolations department, as his depression is making him unsuitable for happier events. Tom goes on a blind date with a woman named Alison. Tom spends the date talking about Summer until Alison leaves exasperated. Months later, Tom attends co-worker Millie's wedding and tries to avoid Summer on the train, but she spots him and invites him for coffee. They have a good time at the wedding, dance together, and Summer catches the bouquet. She invites Tom to a party at her apartment, falling asleep on his shoulder on the ride back. He attends the party, hoping to rekindle their relationship, but barely interacts with Summer, spending most of the night drinking alone, until he spots her engagement ring. Tom leaves devastated. Further depressed, he only leaves his apartment for alcohol and junk food. After a few days, he returns to work hung over and, after an emotional outburst, quits. Rachel tells Tom that she does not believe Summer was \"the one\" and that he is only remembering happy memories of the relationship. Tom thinks harder, finally seeing moments of incompatibilities he overlooked, and warning signs he missed on the day of the breakup. One day, Tom finds the energy to get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, as Summer had encouraged him to do. He assembles a portfolio and secures job interviews. Summer visits Tom at his favorite spot in the city. He tells her he left the office, and notes that she got married, which he cannot comprehend as she never wanted to be someone's girlfriend. Summer says she got married because she felt sure, which she did not with Tom. When he says he was wrong about true love existing, she counters that he was right about it, just wrong about it being with her. She tells him she is glad he is doing well. Tom wishes her happiness. On Wednesday, May 23, Tom meets a woman applying for the same job. He finds she shares his favorite spot and invites her for coffee afterwards. She politely declines, then changes her mind. Her name is Autumn.     Cast     Production     Writing  The film is presented as a non-linear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is.

It is based on the French novel \" If Only It Were TrueEt si c'était vrai...\") written by Marc Levy. Steven Spielberg obtained the rights to produce the film from the book. The film was released in the United States and Canada on September 16, 2005.

The date of Theodred's consecration unknown, but the date of his death was sometime between 995 and 997. \"Just Like Heaven\" is a song by British alternative rock band the Cure. The group wrote most of the song during recording sessions in southern France in 1987. The lyrics were written by their frontman Robert Smith, who drew inspiration from a past trip to the sea shore with his future wife. Smith's memories of the trip formed the basis for the song's accompanying music video. Before Smith had completed the lyrics, an instrumental version of the song was used as the theme for the French television show Les Enfants du Rock. \"Just Like Heaven\" was the third single released from their 1987 album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. The song became the Cure's first American hit and reached number 40 on the Billboard charts in 1988. It has been praised by critics and covered by artists such as Dinosaur Jr. and Katie Melua. Smith has said he considers \"Just Like Heaven\" to be one of the band's strongest songs.    Background and recording  In order to develop material for Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Smith forced himself to write music for 15 days of each month. During this regimen, he developed the chords and melody which form the basis of \"Just Like Heaven\". Structurally, Smith found what he had written was similar to the Only Ones's 1979 hit \"Another Girl, Another Planet\". When he brought an instrumental demo of the song to the album recording sessions in Southern France, Cure drummer Boris Williams increased the tempo and added an opening drum fill which inspired Smith to introduce each instrument singularly and in sequence. When the French TV show Les Enfants du Rock asked the Cure to provide a theme song, Smith offered the instrumental version. As he explained, \"It meant the music would be familiar to millions of Europeans even before it was released\". He completed the lyrics when the group moved the sessions to Studio Miraval, located in Le Val, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. The band completed the song quickly, and at the time Smith considered it to be the most obvious potential single from the songs the band had recorded during their two-week stay at Miraval.    Composition and lyrics   \"Just Like Heaven\" is written in the key of A major and consists of an A–E–Bm–D chord progression which repeats throughout the song, except during the chorus when the band plays an F♯m–G–D progression. The song's central hook is formed from a descending guitar riff which appears between song verses and in parts of the bridge and the last verse. This guitar line contrasts with the \"fuzzier mix\" of the rhythm guitars. According to Smith, \"The song is about hyperventilating—kissing and fainting to the floor.\" The lyrics were inspired by a trip with his then-girlfriend (and later wife) Mary Poole to Beachy Head in southern England. Smith said the opening line of the song (\"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick\") refers to his childhood memories of mastering magic tricks, but added \"on another [level], it's about a seduction trick, from much later in my life\".    Reception  \"Just Like Heaven\" was the third single released from the band's Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me album. Melody Maker's review of the single was undecided; writer David Stubbs described it as \"a colourful, fluttery, fussy thing\" and \"unimpeachable\", but added, \"[it] turns my face green, as if having consumed too many truffles.\" The song was the Cure's eleventh top 40 hit in the UK, and stayed on the charts there for five weeks during October and November 1987, peaking at number 29. In the United States, \"Just Like Heaven\" became the Cure's first top 40 hit when it reached number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 for one week in December 1987. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said \"the stately 'Just Like Heaven' [...] is remarkable and helps make the album [Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me] one of the group's very best\". Ned Raggett, also of AllMusic, wrote that the song was \"instantly memorable, [and] sparkling with rough energy [...] it's a perfect showcase for Robert Smith's ear for wistful, romantic numbers. His main guitar line, a descending, gently chiming melody, contrasts perfectly against the fuzzier mix of the rhythm guitars, while Simon Gallup's bass and Boris Williams' strong, immediate drums make for a great introduction to the track.\" Barry Walsh of Slant magazine said the Cure \"...is at the top of its game [...] on the simply stellar 'Just Like Heaven'.

Daniel Waters (born November 10, 1962) is an American screenwriter and film director. He is the older brother of director Mark Waters.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWaters was born in Cleveland, Ohio and raised in South Bend, Indiana. In high school, Waters wrote a popular column titled \"Troubled Waters\" for his high school newspaper, where he wrote fictitious stories about his real-life classmates—not unlike the writing that appeared in his screenplay for Heathers. He then wrote, directed and starred alongside Larry Karaszewski in a local sketch comedy titled Beyond Our Control in the early 1980s. Waters moved to Montreal where he graduated from McGill University. After graduation, he moved to Los Angeles, and was the manager of a video store.\n\n\n== Screenwriting credits ==\nWaters came to prominence in 1988 for writing the black comedy Heathers, for which he received a 1990 Edgar Award. Heathers was an attempt for him to write of the true nature of teenagers and high-school society. Heathers was not a box-office hit for Waters when it was released, but the movie has become a cult classic. Waters won the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Motion Picture.\nOver the next four years, Waters served as co-writer on the comedy The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, wrote the sequel Batman Returns, and then wrote the films Hudson Hawk (for which he re-teamed with Heathers director Michael Lehmann) and Demolition Man. He received the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay for both Hudson Hawk and Ford Fairlane. In 1995, he authored the first draft of the Catwoman solo movie. The story about Selina moving to a Vegas-like city called 'Oasisburg' and fighting parodies of male superheroes failed to resonate with Tim Burton or anyone at Warner.\n\n\n== Turn as a director ==\nIn 2001, Waters made his directorial debut with Happy Campers, another teen comedy in a black vein that, after a long delay, was released straight to DVD.  His follow-up, Sex and Death 101, a hybrid of science fiction, dark comedy, and romantic thriller, won the Golden Space Needle Award for Best Director at the 2007 Seattle International Film Festival. It was released theatrically on April 4, 2008, in New York and Los Angeles. The film re-teamed Waters with Heathers star Winona Ryder.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== As writer ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDaniel Waters at IMDb\nDaniel Waters at the American Film Institute Catalog Mark Waters (born 1964) is an American film director.\nMark Waters may also refer to:\n\n\n== See also ==\nMark Walters (born 1964), English footballer\nMark Walters (cyclist) (born 1976), Canadian former cyclist\nMark Watters (born 1955), music composer And Just Like That... is an American comedy drama television series developed by Michael Patrick King for Max.

Nicknamed \"Lady Day\" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills. After a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in Harlem, where she was heard by the producer John Hammond, who commended her voice. She signed a recording contract with Brunswick in 1935. Collaborations with Teddy Wilson yielded the hit \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\", which became a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Holiday had mainstream success on labels such as Columbia and Decca. By the late 1940s, however, she was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, she performed at a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall, but her reputation deteriorated because of her drug and alcohol problems. She was a successful concert performer throughout the 1950s with two further sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall. Due to personal struggles and an altered voice, her final recordings were met with mixed reaction, but were mild commercial successes. Her final album, \"Lady in Satin\", was released in 1958. Holiday died of cirrhosis on July 17, 1959. She won four Grammy Awards, all of them posthumously, for Best Historical Album. She was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1973. \"Lady Sings the Blues\", a film about her life, starring Diana Ross, was released in 1972. She is the primary character in the play (later made into a film) \" Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill\" ; the role was originated by Reenie Upchurch in 1986, and was played by Audra McDonald on Broadway and in the film. In 2017 Holiday was inducted into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. Billie Holiday (born Eleanora Fagan; April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959) was an American jazz and swing music singer.

She was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. In 2000, she was also inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as an early influence; their website states that \"Billie Holiday changed jazz forever\". She was named one of the 50 Great Voices by NPR; and was ranked fourth on the Rolling Stone list of \"200 Greatest Singers of All Time\" (2023). Several films about her life have been released, most recently The United States vs. Billie Holiday (2021).    Life and career     1915–1929: Childhood  Eleanora Fagan was born on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia to African American unwed teenage couple Clarence Halliday and Sarah Julia \"Sadie\" Fagan (née Harris). Her mother moved to Philadelphia at age 19, after she was evicted from her parents' home in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland, for becoming pregnant. With no support from her parents, she made arrangements with her older, married half-sister, Eva Miller, for Eleanora to stay with her in Baltimore. Not long after Eleanora was born, Clarence abandoned his family to pursue a career as a jazz banjo player and guitarist. Some historians have disputed Holiday's paternity, as a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives lists her father as \"Frank DeViese\". Other historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker. DeViese lived in Philadelphia, and Sadie, then known by her maiden name Harris, may have met him through her work. Harris married Philip Gough in 1920, but the marriage only lasted a few years.  Eleanora grew up in Baltimore and had a very difficult childhood. Her mother often took what were then known as \"transportation jobs\", serving on passenger railroads. Holiday was raised largely by Eva Miller's mother-in-law, Martha Miller, and suffered from her mother's absences and being in others' care for her first decade of life. Holiday's autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, published in 1956, is inconsistent regarding details of her early life, but much was confirmed by Stuart Nicholson in his 1995 biography of the singer. Holiday frequently skipped school which resulted in her being brought before the juvenile court at age nine. She was sent to the House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic reform school for girls, where the nuns locked her in a room with a dead girl overnight as punishment for misbehavior. The experience traumatized her, and for years she would \"dream about it and wake up hollering and screaming\". After nine months, she was released on October 3, 1925, to her mother. Sadie had opened a restaurant, the East Side Grill, and mother and daughter worked long hours there. She dropped out of school at age 11. On December 24, 1926, Sadie came home to discover a neighbor attempting to rape Holiday. She successfully fought back, and he was arrested. Officials sent Holiday to the House of the Good Shepherd under protective custody as a state witness in the rape case. Holiday was released in February 1927, when she was nearly 12. The United States vs. Billie Holiday is a 2021 American biographical drama film about singer Billie Holiday, based on the book Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs by Johann Hari. Directed by Lee Daniels, the film stars Andra Day in the title role, along with Trevante Rhodes, Garrett Hedlund, Leslie Jordan (in his final film appearance), Miss Lawrence, Adriane Lenox, Natasha Lyonne, Rob Morgan, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Evan Ross, and Tyler James Williams. Initially set to be released theatrically in the United States by Paramount Pictures, the film was sold to Hulu in December 2020 and digitally released in the United States on February 26, 2021. The United States vs. Billie Holiday received mixed reviews from critics; while Day's performance was praised, the direction and screenplay were criticized as unfocused. For her performance, Day was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama. The film was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song (\"Tigress and Tweed\") and the soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media, for Andra Day, Salaam Remi, and Lynn Fainchtein.    Plot  In 1957, Billie Holiday meets with a radio journalist, Reginald Lord Devine, for an interview. He asks her what it is like to be a \"colored woman\" and about the trouble she keeps getting into because of her hit song \"Strange Fruit\". Billie states that the lyrics are about human rights, something the government often forgets. In 1947, Billie's husband Monroe and her manager, Joe Glaser, try to get Billie to cut \"Strange Fruit\" from her set list, fearing legal problems if they continue to perform something so controversial. Lester Young, Billie's sax player and longtime confidant, supports her in playing it. In the 1940s, FBN chief Harry J. Anslinger declares Billie to be the top priority for his agents, as she is considered to be politically threatening due to the nature of her songs. Unable to arrest her for singing, they decide to go after her on drug charges. After Billie's next show, Agent Jimmy Fletcher, disguised as a soldier, witnesses her doing drugs. The FBI arrest Billie and her lover Joe Guy for drug use and possession. The judge sentences Billie to a year in jail after Guy, bribed by Anslinger, testifies against her. Anslinger assigns Jimmy to visit Billie in prison, confident that he can get her to incriminate herself on further charges that will lead to a longer sentence. Instead, Jimmy (who has become convinced that Billie is being wrongfully persecuted) tells her to not trust anyone and keep her nose clean, lest the government find another way to destroy her. After Billie is released from prison, she does a Carnegie Hall show, where she regretfully declines an audience member's request to sing \"Strange Fruit\". She is then introduced to promoter John Levy, who says he can pay off certain people to ensure she can keep performing. They begin a relationship, but when Levy is threatened with prosecution for allowing drug deals in his clubs, he betrays Billie by planting drugs on her person just as Anslinger's men burst in. In court, Fletcher admits under cross-examination that Billie was possibly framed, and she is freed. Anslinger again orders Fletcher to follow Billie on tour, pretending that he is leaving the Bureau. In 1949, Jimmy comes to see Billie after a successful tour stop and reveals his deception. Suspicious, the whole crew has Jimmy do heroin to show he can be trusted. Over the course of the tour, Jimmy and Billie fall in love. One day, after the bus breaks down, Billie breaks up with Jimmy and sends him away, feeling that he deserves a nice girl, which she can never be. Jimmy then learns that Anslinger has fired him for using drugs on duty. Billie marries Louis McKay, but eventually leaves him Jimmy. In 1959, a now middle-aged Billie is dying in a hospital room from liver failure after decades of alcohol abuse. Anslinger visits her one last time, offering to erase her criminal record if she furnishes the names of other drug-using acquaintances. Billie mockingly replies that his grandkids will be singing \"Strange Fruit\" one day.    Cast     Production  Development on a new Billie Holiday biopic was announced in September 2019, with Lee Daniels directing. Andra Day was set to play the title role, with Trevante Rhodes, Garrett Hedlund and Natasha Lyonne also cast. Evan Ross, Dana Gourrier and Erik LaRay Harvey were also added later that month. Additional casting was announced in October. Billie Holiday Sings (MGC-118) is a 10-inch LP album made by jazz singer Billie Holiday, released in the United States by Clef Records in 1952.

The final track, \"Tenderly\", had been previously released on her second 10-inch LP, An Evening with Billie Holiday (MG C-144). The other three new songs had been previously released on her third 10-inch LP, simply titled Billie Holiday (MG C-161).\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== 1952 10\" LP, Billie Holiday Sings ===\nA side\n\"I Only Have Eyes for You\" (Al Dubin, Harry Warren) – 2:57\n\"You Turned the Tables on Me\" (Louis Alter, Sidney D.

White Plains is a city and the county seat of Westchester County, New York, United States. It is the 29th-largest municipality in the state of New York, an inner suburb of New York City, and a commercial hub of Westchester County, a densely populated suburban county that is home to about one million people. White Plains is located in south-central Westchester County. Its downtown (Mamaroneck Avenue) is 25 miles (40 km) north of Midtown Manhattan. The city's total population was 59,599 in the 2020 census, up from 53,077 at the 2010 census. According to the city government, the daytime weekday population is estimated at 250,000.    History     Early history  At the time of the Dutch settlement of Manhattan in the early 17th century, the region had been used as farmland by the Weckquaeskeck tribe, a Wappinger people, and was called \"Quarropas\". To early traders it was known as \"the White Plains\", either from the white balsam (Gnaphalium polycephalum) which was said to have covered it, or from the heavy mist that local tradition suggests hovered over the swamplands near the Bronx River. The first non-native settlement came in November 1683, when a party of Connecticut Puritans moved westward from an earlier settlement in Rye and bought about 4,400 acres (18 km2), presumably from the Weckquaeskeck. However, John Richbell of Mamaroneck claimed to have earlier title to much of the territory through his purchase of a far larger plot extending 20 miles (32 km) inland, perhaps from a different tribe. The matter was not settled until 1721, when a Royal Patent for White Plains was granted by King George II. In 1758, White Plains became the seat of Westchester County when the colonial government for the county left West Chester, which was located in what is now the northern part of the borough of the Bronx, in New York City. The unincorporated village remained part of the Town of Rye until 1788 when the town of White Plains was created. On July 9, 1776, a copy of the Declaration of Independence was delivered to the New York Provincial Congress, which was meeting in the county courthouse. The delegates quickly adopted a resolution approving the Declaration, thus declaring both the colony's independence and the formation of the State of New York. The Declaration itself was first publicly read from the steps of the courthouse on July 11. During September and October 1776, troops led by George Washington took up positions in the hills of the village, hotly pursued by the British under General Sir William Howe, who attacked on October 28. The Battle of White Plains took place primarily on Chatterton Hill, (later known as \"Battle Hill,\" and located just west of what was then a swamp but is now the downtown area) and the Bronx River. Howe's force of 4,000–6,000 British and Hessian soldiers required three attacks before the Continentals, numbering about 1,600 under the command of Generals Alexander McDougall and Israel Putnam, retreated, joining Washington's main force, which did not take part in the battle. Howe's forces had suffered 250 casualties, a severe loss, and he made no attempt to pursue the Continentals, whose casualties were about 125 dead and wounded. Three days after the battle, Washington withdrew north of the village, which was then occupied by Howe's forces. But after several inconclusive skirmishes over the next week, Howe withdrew on November 5, leaving White Plains to the Continentals. Ironically, one of Washington's subordinates, Major John Austin, who was probably drunk after having celebrated the enemy's withdrawal, reentered the village with his detachment and proceeded to burn it down. Although he was court-martialed and convicted for this action, he escaped punishment. The first United States Census, conducted in 1790, listed the White Plains population at 505, of whom 46 were slaves. (New York City's population at that time was about 33,000.) By 1800, the population stood at 575 and in 1830, 830. By 1870, 26 years after the arrival of the New York Central Railroad, it had swollen to 2,630 and by 1890 to 4,508. In the decades that followed the count grew to 7,899 (1900) and 26,425 (1910). White Plains was incorporated as a village in 1866 and as a city in 1916.    Modern history   After World War II, White Plains' downtown area developed into a shopping district featuring branches of many famous New York-based department and specialty stores. The Plains of Abraham (French: Plaines d'Abraham) is a historic area within the Battlefields Park in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. It was established on 17 March 1908. The land is the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, which took place on 13 September 1759, but hundreds of acres of the fields became used for grazing, housing, and minor industrial structures. Only in 1908 was the land ceded to Quebec City, though administered by the specifically created and federally-run National Battlefields Commission. The park is today used by 4 million visitors and tourists annually for sports, relaxation, outdoor concerts, and festivals.    Plains of Abraham Museum  The Plains of Abraham Museum serves as the park's information and reception centre. It features a multi-media exhibition about the siege of Quebec and the 1759 and 1760 battles of the Plains of Abraham. Other displays feature the history of the site through archaeological artifacts found in the park. Open year-round and located at 835 Wilfrid-Laurier Avenue, the museum serves as the starting point for tours and includes a gift shop.    Name and features   The plains are likely named after Abraham Martin (also known as L'Écossais) (1589–1664), a fisherman and river pilot called The Scot. Martin moved to Quebec City in 1635 with his wife Marguerite Langlois and received 32 acres (13 ha) of land divided between the lower town and promontory from the Company of New France. Abraham's name appears in the toponymy of Quebec City at the time of the French regime, the deeds of the 17th and 18th centuries referring to the coast of Abraham, and a 1734 plan even precisely locating an Abraham Street. Later, the journals of the Chevalier de Levis and the Marquis de Montcalm referred to the Heights of Abraham, as did the diaries of British soldiers, who also employed the phrase Plains of Abraham.  The park itself currently occupies an area approximately 2.4 km (1.5 mi) long by 0.8 km (0.50 mi), 98 hectares (240 acres) that extends westward from the Citadelle of Quebec and the walls of Quebec City along a plateau above the Saint Lawrence River, and forms a part of The Battlefields Park. An interpretive centre and walking trails have been built on the site, and monuments commemorate the Battle of Sainte-Foy and James Wolfe, the latter being an astronomic meridian marker raised in 1790 by the Surveyor-General of Canada, Major Holland, on the site where Wolfe was said to have died. In 1913, the National Battlefields Commission placed a column identical to one that had been built on the site in 1849, and a replica Cross of Sacrifice was constructed on the plains to commemorate soldiers who were lost in World War I; it continues to be the location of Remembrance Day ceremonies every year.    History   On September 13, 1759, the area was the scene of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, part of the French and Indian War (1754–63), which preceded, then became a theatre of, the Seven Years' War (1756–63). On that date, British soldiers under the command of General Wolfe, climbed the steep cliff under the city in darkness, surprising and defeating the French, through a single deadly volley of musket fire, causing the battle to be over within 30 minutes. Both Wolfe and the French commander, the Marquis de Montcalm, died of their wounds, but the battle left control of Quebec City to the British, eventually allowing them to take control of Canada the following year. The plains thereafter remained nondescript fields, with only a monument to Wolfe as a reminder of the events that took place. As Quebec City grew, development of the plains took place unabated, and hundreds of acres were built over. Only in 1901 did government intervention come, when the proposed subdivision of 88 acres (36 ha) of the area was halted by the purchase of the land by the Dominion Crown. At the same time, however, another area of the plains was taken and, despite public protest, covered by a Ross rifle factory, which included a water tank built upon an existing Martello tower. A movement to preserve the site continued, nonetheless, and by 1904, the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec was permitted by the federal government to put up plaques at various significant spots around the vicinity. John Martin Feeney (February 1, 1894 – August 31, 1973), known professionally as John Ford, was an American film director and producer. He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers during the Golden Age of Hollywood, and was one of the first American directors to be recognized as an auteur. In a career of more than 50 years, he directed over 140 films between 1917 and 1965 (although most of his silent films are now lost), and received six Academy Awards including a record four wins for Best Director for The Informer (1935), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), How Green Was My Valley (1941), and The Quiet Man (1952). Ford is renowned for his Westerns, such as Stagecoach (1939), My Darling Clementine (1946), Fort Apache (1948), The Searchers (1956), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962); though he worked in many other genres, including comedies, period dramas, and documentaries. He made frequent use of location shooting and wide shots, in which his characters were framed against a vast, harsh, and rugged natural terrain. He is credited with launching the careers of some of Hollywood's biggest stars during the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, including John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Maureen O'Hara and James Stewart. Ford's work was held in high regard by his contemporaries, with Akira Kurosawa, Orson Welles, Frank Capra, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Ingmar Bergman naming him one of the greatest directors of all time. Subsequent generations of directors, including many of the major figures of the New Hollywood movement, have cited his influence. The Harvard Film Archive writes that \"the breadth and measure of Ford’s major contributions to the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema, and to film language in general, remains somewhat difficult to discern.... Rarely recognized in full are Ford’s great achievements as a consummate visual stylist and master storyteller.\"    Early life  Ford was born John Martin \"Jack\" Feeney (though he later often gave his given names as Seán Aloysius, sometimes with surname O'Feeny or Ó Fearna; an Irish language equivalent of Feeney) in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, to John Augustine Feeney and Barbara \"Abbey\" Curran, on February 1, 1894, (though he occasionally said 1895 and that date is erroneously inscribed on his tombstone). His father, John Augustine, was born in Spiddal, County Galway, Ireland, in 1854. Barbara Curran was born in the Aran Islands, in the town of Kilronan on the island of Inishmore (Inis Mór). John A. Feeney's grandmother, Barbara Morris, was said to be a member of an impoverished branch of a family of the Irish nobility, the Morrises of Spiddal (headed at present by Lord Killanin). John Augustine and Barbara Curran arrived in Boston and Portland respectively in May and June 1872. They filed their intentions to marry on July 31, 1875, and became American citizens five years later on September 11, 1880. The John Augustine Feeney family resided on Sheridan Street, in the Irish neighborhood of Munjoy Hill in Portland, Maine, and his father worked a variety of odd jobs to support the family—farming, fishing, a laborer for the gas company, saloon keeping, and an alderman. In interviews John Ford said that his family was well off, he said that they had a farm and his father fished. John and Barbara had eleven children: Mamie (Mary Agnes), born 1876; Delia (Edith), 1878–1881; Patrick; Francis Ford, 1881–1953; Bridget, 1883–1884; Barbara, born and died 1888; Edward, born 1889; Josephine, born 1891; Hannah (Joanna), born and died 1892; John Martin, 1894–1973; and Daniel, born and died 1896 (or 1898). Feeney attended Portland High School, Portland, Maine, where he played fullback and defensive tackle. He earned the nickname \"Bull\" because, it is said, of the way he would lower his helmet and charge the line. A Portland pub, named \"Bull Feeney's\" in his honor, was open from 2002 to 2023. He later moved to California, and in 1914 began working in film production as well as acting for his older brother Francis, adopting \"Jack Ford\" as a professional name. In addition to credited roles, he appeared uncredited as a Klansman in D. W. The plains bison (Bison bison bison) is one of two subspecies/ecotypes of the American bison, the other being the wood bison (B. b. athabascae). A natural population of plains bison survives in Yellowstone National Park (the Yellowstone Park bison herd consisting of an estimated 4,800 bison) and multiple smaller reintroduced herds of bison in many places in the United States as well as southern portions of the Canadian Prairies.    Near extinction and reintroduction   At least 25 million American bison were once spread across the United States and Canada, but by the late 1880s, the total number of bison in the United States had been reduced to fewer than 600, most of which lived on private ranches. The last known free-roaming population of bison consisted of fewer than 30 in the area that later became Yellowstone National Park. Although farmers and ranchers considered bison to be a nuisance, some people were concerned about the demise of this \"North American icon\", so individual landowners and zoos took steps to protect them. Some people saved bison with the express purpose of ranching or hunting them (see Antelope Island bison herd). Others, such as the American Bison Society, were also formed with the idea of saving the species and reintroducing them to natural range.  Plains bison have since been reintroduced into a number of locations in North America. Five main foundation herds of American bison supplied animals intended to save them from extinction. The northernmost introduction occurred in 1928 when the Alaska Game Commission brought bison to the area of present-day Delta Junction. Bison taken from this transplant were also introduced to other Alaskan locations, including Farewell and Chitina. The Delta Junction herd prospered the most, with a population of several hundred throughout the late 20th century. This herd is popular with hunters interested in hundreds of pounds of high-quality meat, but has been a problem for farming operations in the area. Though American bison generally prefer grasslands and plains habitats, they are quite adaptable and live in conditions ranging from desert, as in the case of the  Henry Mountains bison herd, to forested areas, such as those of the Yellowstone Park bison herd; yet, they are all of the same subspecies Bison bison bison. Currently, over 500,000 bison are spread over the United States and Canada, but most of these are on private ranches, and some of them have small amounts of hybridized cattle genes. Significant public bison herds that do not appear to have hybridized domestic cattle genes are the Yellowstone Park, the Henry Mountains, the Custer State Park, the Wind Cave, and the Wood Buffalo National Park bison herds and subsidiary herds descended from it in Canada. Park officials transferred plains bison from Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge to Theodore Roosevelt National Park's South Unit in 1956 and its North Unit in 1962 for population increase.  In 1969, plains bison from Elk Island National Park were released into Prince Albert National Park in Saskatchewan, creating the Sturgeon River bison herd. At a population around 300 animals, they form a free herd able to wander where they please. The bison are spread throughout Prince Albert National Park's southwestern corner, as well as some crown and private land in the area. In 2006, plains bison from Elk Island National Park in Alberta were released into Saskatchewan's Grasslands National Park. This marks the first time they have wandered the shortgrass prairies of Canada since their near extinction at the turn of the 20th century. According to the national agency Parks Canada, the entire breeding population of these wild and \"semiwild\" bison is descended from just eight individuals that survived the period of near extinction, due to overhunting and tuberculosis infecting the herd.  A herd of about 650 of these animals lives in, and can be seen at, the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge near Lawton, Oklahoma. The herd was started in 1907 with stock from the New York Zoological Park, now known as the Bronx Zoo and located in the Bronx Park. Fifteen animals were shipped to Oklahoma, where bison had already become extinct due to excessive hunting and overharvesting by non-native commercial buffalo hunters from 1874 to 1878. Some of these specimens have been released in other areas of the United States, such as Paynes Prairie in Florida.Only one southern plains bison herd was established in Texas. A remnant of the last of this relict herd had been saved in 1876. \"Molly\" Goodnight had encouraged her rancher husband, Charles Goodnight, to save some of the last bison which were taking refuge in the Texas Panhandle. By saving these few plains bison, she was able to establish a buffalo herd near the Palo Duro Canyon. Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.

The Great Plains are a broad expanse of flatland in North America. The region is located just to the east of the Rocky Mountains, much of it covered in prairie, steppe, and grassland. They are the western part of the Interior Plains, which include the mixed grass prairie, the tallgrass prairie between the Great Lakes and Appalachian Plateau, and the Taiga Plains and Boreal Plains ecozones in Northern Canada. \"Great Plains\" or Western Plains also describe the ecoregion of the Great Plains, or alternatively the western portion of the Great Plains. The Great Plains lie across both Central United States and Western Canada, encompassing:  Most or all of the U.S. states of Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota; Eastern parts of the U.S. states of Colorado, Montana,  and Wyoming; Parts of the U.S. states of New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Sometimes western parts of Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri; The southern portions of the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.    Usage  The term \"Great Plains\" is used in the United States to describe a sub-section of the even more vast Interior Plains physiographic division, which covers much of the interior of North America. It also has currency as a region of human geography, referring to the Plains Indians or the Plains states. In Canada the term is rarely used; Natural Resources Canada, the government department responsible for official mapping, treats the Interior Plains as one unit consisting of several related plateaus and plains. There is no region referred to as the \"Great Plains\" in the Atlas of Canada. In terms of human geography, the term prairie is more commonly used in Canada, and the region is known as the Canadian Prairies, Prairie Provinces or simply \"the Prairies\". The North American Environmental Atlas, produced by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) agency composed of the geographical agencies of the Mexican, American, and Canadian governments, uses the \"Great Plains\" as an ecoregion synonymous with predominant prairies and grasslands rather than as physiographic region defined by topography. The Great Plains ecoregion includes five sub-regions: Temperate Prairies, West-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, South-Central Semi-Arid Prairies, Texas Louisiana Coastal Plains, and Tamaulipas-Texas Semi-Arid Plain, which overlap or expand upon other Great Plains designations.    Extent   The region is about 500 mi (800 km) east to west and 2,000 mi (3,200 km) north to south. Much of the region was home to American bison herds until they were hunted to near extinction during the mid/late-19th century. It has an area of approximately 500,000 sq mi (1,300,000 km2). Current thinking regarding the geographic boundaries of the Great Plains is shown by this map at the Center for Great Plains Studies, University of Nebraska–Lincoln. This definition, however, is primarily ecological, not physiographic. The Boreal Plains of Western Canada are physiographically the same, but differentiated by their tundra and forest (rather than grassland) appearance. The term \"Great Plains\", for the region west of about the 96th meridian west and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study Physiographic Subdivision of the United States brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Before that the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states. Today the term \"High Plains\" is used for a subregion of the Great Plains. The term still remains little-used in Canada compared to the more common, \"prairie\".    Geography   The Great Plains are the westernmost portion of the vast North American Interior Plains, which extend east to the Appalachian Plateau. Francis Ford (born Francis Joseph Feeney; August 14, 1881 – September 5, 1953) was an American film actor, writer and director. He was the mentor and elder brother of film director John Ford. As an actor, director and producer, he was one of the first filmmakers in Hollywood. He also appeared in many of his brother John's movies as a character actor, including The Informer (1935), Young Mr. Lincoln (1939) and The Quiet Man (1952). He gave a memorable performance as one of the men who are lynched in The Ox-Bow Incident.    Biography  He was born Francis Joseph Feeney in Portland, Maine on August 14, 1881, the son of John Augustine Feeney and Barbara \"Abbey\" Curran. An Irish immigrant, John Feeney was born in the village of Spiddal, County Galway, Ireland, on June 15, 1854. By 1878, John had moved to Portland, Maine, and opened a saloon, at 42 Center Street, that used a false front to pose as grocery store. John opened four others in following years. Francis Feeney served in the United States Army in the Spanish–American War but was sent home for being underage. Leaving Portland, he drifted into the film business in New York City, working for David Horsley and Al Christie. Moving to Texas, he was part of the Star Film Company's San Antonio operation under Gaston Méliès.  Feeney adopted his stage name \"Ford\" from the automobile. Moving to Los Angeles from San Antonio, Francis began his Hollywood career working for Thomas H. Ince at Ince's Bison studio, directing and appearing in westerns.    Work   Ambitious and prolific, in Ford's early work he cast himself as George Armstrong Custer, Sherlock Holmes (with his younger brother as Dr. Watson) and Abraham Lincoln, a role in which he specialized. By 1912, Ford was directing alongside Thomas Ince.  It rapidly became clear that Ince was routinely taking credit for Ford's work, so in 1913, Ford moved over to the Universal Film Manufacturing Co., a movie studio founded by Carl Laemmle the previous year. His 1913 Lucille Love, Girl of Mystery was Universal's first serial, and the first of a string of very popular serials starring Ford's collaborator and lover Grace Cunard. The 1915 serial The Broken Coin was expanded from 15 to 22 episodes by popular demand, and likely represents the height of Ford's career.  In 1917, Ford founded a short-lived independent company, Fordart Films, which released the 1918 Berlin via America with Phil Kelly, and briefly opened his own studio at Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street. At the same time, Ford mentored his younger brother, collaborating frequently as writers, directors and actors in each other's projects, but as early as 1917, it was clear that John's star was on the rise. Frank's directorial style remained suitable for serials, but failed to evolve. Ford's final known directorial credit is for the 1928 The Call of the Heart, a 50-minute vehicle for \"Dynamite the Devil Dog\". Ford may have acted in over 400 films, with many of his early credits poorly documented and probably lost.    Character Actor  From the late 1920s, and for the next two decades, Ford sustained a career as a grizzled character actor and bit player. He is often uncredited, as in his appearance in James Whale's 1931 Frankenstein. Among his most memorable roles was that of the demented old man in The Ox-Bow Incident (1943), for which he also was uncredited.    Relationship with John Ford  Ford's younger brother, John M. Feeney, nicknamed \"Bull,\" was a successful fullback and defensive tackle on a Portland High state championship football team. In 1914, \"Bull\" followed Francis to Hollywood, changed his name to John Ford and eventually surpassed his elder brother's considerable reputation.  Ford's son, Philip Ford, was also a film actor/director. Ford died after being diagnosed with cancer. The Ford brothers were, at the best of times, critical of each other and sometimes sharply antagonistic. Ford wrote an unpublished memoir in 1934 called Up and Down the Ladder which is \"filled with bitter and sometimes heartrending complaints about how old-timers who had helped create the industry had been shunted aside by younger men.\" When Jack Ford was first in Hollywood working for his brother, Francis had him perform a dangerous stunt where, as his elder brother's stunt double, he ran across a railroad station roof and jumped onto a moving train. At the time he was performing the stunt, the younger brother said to the older that he owed him for the stunt. Brian Patrick Kennedy( born 5 November 1961) is an Irish- born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States. He is currently the director of the Peabody Essex Museum. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia( Canberra) from 1997- 2004. Francis Ford Coppola ( KOH-pə-lə, Italian: [ˈkɔppola]; born 7 April 1939) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He is considered one of the leading figures of the New Hollywood film movement and is widely considered one of the greatest directors of all time. Coppola is the recipient of five Academy Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, two Palmes d'Or, and a BAFTA Award. After directing The Rain People in 1969, Coppola co-wrote Patton (1970), which earned him the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay along with Edmund H. North. Coppola's reputation as a filmmaker was cemented with the release of The Godfather (1972) which won three Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay and revolutionized the gangster genre of filmmaking, receiving strong commercial and critical reception. He directed The Godfather Part II (1974) which also won Best Picture with Coppola earning the Best Director.  Also in 1974, Coppola released the thriller The Conversation, which received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. His next film, the war epic Apocalypse Now (1979), which had a notoriously lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for vividly depicting the Vietnam War. It also won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only ten filmmakers to have won the award twice. Coppola later directed notable films such as The Outsiders and Rumble Fish (both 1983), The Cotton Club (1984), Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), The Godfather Part III (1990), Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) and The Rainmaker (1997). Coppola has acted as producer on such diverse films as American Graffiti (1973), The Black Stallion (1979), The Escape Artist (1982), Hammett (1982), Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1985) and The Secret Garden (1993). Many of Coppola's relatives and children have become popular actors and filmmakers: his sister Talia Shire is an actress, his daughter Sofia is a director, his son Roman is a screenwriter, and his nephews Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage are actors. Coppola resides in Napa, California, and since the 2010s has been a vintner, owning a family-branded winery of his own.    Early life and education  Francis Ford Coppola was born in Detroit, Michigan, to father Carmine Coppola (1910–1991), a flautist with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and mother Italia Coppola (née Pennino; 1912–2004), a family of 2nd-degree Italian immigrants. His paternal grandparents came to the United States from Bernalda, Basilicata. His maternal grandfather, popular Italian composer Francesco Pennino, emigrated from Naples, Italy. At the time of Coppola's birth, his father—in addition to being a flautist—was an arranger and assistant orchestra director for The Ford Sunday Evening Hour, an hour-long concert music radio series sponsored by the Ford Motor Company. Coppola was born at Henry Ford Hospital, and those two connections to Henry Ford inspired the Coppolas to choose the middle name \"Ford\" for their son. Francis is the middle of three children: his older brother was August Coppola, and his younger sister is actress Talia Shire. Two years after Coppola's birth, his father was named principal flutist for the NBC Symphony Orchestra, and the family moved to New York. They settled in Woodside, Queens, where Coppola spent the remainder of his childhood. Having contracted polio as a boy, Coppola was bedridden for large periods of his childhood, during which he did homemade puppet theater productions. He developed an interest in theater after reading A Streetcar Named Desire at age 15. He created 8 mm feature films edited from home movies with titles such as The Rich Millionaire and The Lost Wallet. Although Coppola was a mediocre student, his interest in technology and engineering earned him the childhood nickname \"Science\". He trained initially for a career in music and became proficient in the tuba, eventually earning a music scholarship to the New York Military Academy. In all, Coppola attended 23 schools before he eventually graduated from Great Neck North High School. He entered Hofstra College in 1955 as a theater arts major. There, he was awarded a scholarship in playwriting. This furthered his interest in directing theater, though his father disapproved and wanted him to study engineering. Coppola was profoundly impressed by Sergei Eisenstein's film October: Ten Days That Shook the World, especially the quality of its editing, and decided to pursue cinema rather than theater. He said he was influenced to become a writer by his brother August. Jesse Edward Hobson( May 2, 1911 – November 5, 1970) was the director of SRI International from 1947 to 1955. Prior to SRI, he was the director of the Armour Research Foundation.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Academics and alumni of the university include former British Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin, the British composer Sir Edward Elgar and eleven Nobel laureates.    History     Queen's College   The earliest beginnings of the university were originally traced back to the Queen's College, which is linked to William Sands Cox in his aim of creating a medical school along strictly Christian lines, unlike the contemporary London medical schools. Further research revealed the roots of the Birmingham Medical School in the medical education seminars of John Tomlinson, the first surgeon to the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary, and later to the Birmingham General Hospital. These classes, held in the winter of 1767–68, were the first such lectures ever held in England or Wales. The first clinical teaching was undertaken by medical apprentices at the General Hospital, founded in 1779. The medical school which grew out of the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary was founded in 1828, but Cox began teaching in December 1825. Queen Victoria granted her patronage to the Clinical Hospital in Birmingham and allowed it to be styled \"The Queen's Hospital\". It was the first provincial teaching hospital in England. In 1843, the medical college became known as Queen's College.    Mason Science College   In 1870, Sir Josiah Mason, the Birmingham industrialist and philanthropist, who made his fortune in making key rings, pens, pen nibs and electroplating, drew up the Foundation Deed for Mason Science College. The college was founded in 1875. It was this institution that would eventually form the nucleus of the University of Birmingham. In 1882, the Departments of Chemistry, Botany and Physiology were transferred to Mason Science College, soon followed by the Departments of Physics and Comparative Anatomy. The transfer of the Medical School to Mason Science College gave considerable impetus to the growing importance of that college and in 1896 a move to incorporate it as a university college was made. As the result of the Mason University College Act 1897 (60 & 61 Vict. c. xx) it became incorporated as Mason University College on 1 January 1898, with Joseph Chamberlain becoming the President of its Court of Governors.    Royal charter   It was largely due to Chamberlain's enthusiasm that the university was granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria on 24 March 1900. The Calthorpe family offered twenty-five acres (10 hectares) of land on the Bournbrook side of their estate in July. The Court of Governors received the Birmingham University Act 1900 (63 & 64 Vict. c. xix), which put the royal charter into effect on 31 May. The transfer of Mason University College to the new University of Birmingham, with Chamberlain as its first chancellor and Sir Oliver Lodge as the first principal, was complete. A remnant of Josiah Mason's legacy is the Mermaid from his coat-of-arms, which appears in the sinister chief of the university shield and of his college, the double-headed lion in the dexter. The commerce faculty was founded by Sir William Ashley in 1901, who from 1902 until 1923 served as first Professor of Commerce and Dean of the Faculty. From 1905 to 1908, Edward Elgar held the position of Peyton Professor of Music at the university. Joseph Edwin Johnson( born July 9, 1933) is an American academic. He served as the president of University of Tennessee system from 1991 to 1999. He is an alumnus of Birmingham – Southern College and the University of Tennessee. Canon Doctor Terry Slater is an honorary senior research fellow in Historical Geography at the University of Birmingham, UK. Born in Bromley but raised in Charlton he was educated at Hull University, University College, London and the University of Birmingham. He joined the University of Birmingham as a lecturer in 1971 and continued until retirement. He devoted a lot of his spare time to the Church of England in Birmingham that led to him being made an honorary Lay Canon of St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham in 2005.

Sir Joseph Austen Chamberlain  (16 October 1863 – 16 March 1937) was a British statesman, son of Joseph Chamberlain and older half-brother of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for 45 years, as Chancellor of the Exchequer (twice) and was briefly Conservative Party leader before serving as Foreign Secretary. Brought up to be the political heir of his father, whom he physically resembled, he was elected to Parliament as a Liberal Unionist at a by-election in 1892. He held office in the Unionist coalition governments of 1895–1905, remaining in the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer (1903–05) after his father resigned in 1903 to campaign for Tariff Reform. After his father's disabling stroke in 1906, Austen became the leading tariff reformer in the House of Commons. Late in 1911 he and Walter Long were due to compete for the leadership of the Conservative Party (in succession to Arthur Balfour), but both withdrew in favour of Bonar Law rather than risk a party split on a close result. Chamberlain returned to office in H. H. Asquith's wartime coalition government in May 1915, as Secretary of State for India, but resigned to take responsibility for the disastrous Kut Campaign. He again returned to office in David Lloyd George's coalition government, once again serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He then served as Conservative Party leader in the Commons (1921–2), before resigning after the Carlton Club meeting voted to end the Lloyd George Coalition. Like many leading coalitionists, he did not hold office in the Conservative governments of 1922–4. By now regarded as an elder statesman, he served an important term as Foreign Secretary in Stanley Baldwin's second government (1924–29). He negotiated the Locarno Treaties (1925), aimed at preventing war between France and Germany, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Chamberlain last held office as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1931. He was one of the few MPs supporting Winston Churchill's appeals for rearmament against the German threat in the 1930s and remained an active backbench MP until his death in 1937.    Early life  Austen Chamberlain was born in Birmingham, the second child and eldest son of Joseph Chamberlain, then a rising industrialist and political radical, later Mayor of Birmingham and a dominant figure in Liberal and Unionist politics at the end of the 19th century. His father and mother, the former Harriet Kenrick had a baby daughter Beatrice Chamberlain who would become an educationalist. Harriet died giving birth to Austen, leaving his father so shaken that for almost 25 years he maintained a distance from his first-born son. In 1868, his father married Harriet's cousin, Florence, and had further children, the oldest of whom, Neville, would become Prime Minister in the year of Austen's death. Austen was dominated by his elder sister and was therefore sent away to be educated first at Rugby School \"to release him from her thrall\", before passing on to Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Trinity College, he became a lifelong friend of F. S. Oliver, a future advocate of Imperial Federation and, after 1909, a prominent member of the Round Table movement. Chamberlain made his first political address in 1884 at a meeting of the university's Political Society and was vice-president of the Cambridge Union. It would seem that from an early age his father had intended for politics to be Austen's future path, and with that in mind, he was sent first to France, where he studied at the Paris Institute of Political Studies and developed a lasting admiration for the French people and culture. For nine months, he was shown the brilliance of Paris under the Third Republic, and he met and dined with the likes of Georges Clemenceau and Alexandre Ribot. From Paris, Austen was sent to Berlin for twelve months, to imbibe the political culture of the other great European power, Germany. Though in his letters home to Beatrice and Neville, he showed an obvious preference for France and the lifestyle he had left behind there, Chamberlain undertook to learn German and learn from his experience in the capital of the German Empire.

Initially established as the Birmingham College of Art with roots dating back to 1843, it was designated as a polytechnic in 1971 and gained university status in 1992. The university has two main campuses serving four faculties, and offers courses in art and design, business, the built environment, computing, education, engineering, English, healthcare, law, the performing arts, social sciences, and technology. A £125 million extension to its campus in the city centre of Birmingham, part of the Eastside development of a new technology and learning quarter, is opening in two stages, with the first phase having opened in 2013. It is the second largest of five universities in the city, the other four being the University of Birmingham (which is the largest), Aston University, University College Birmingham and Birmingham Newman University. Roughly half of the university's full-time students are from the West Midlands, and a large percentage of these are from ethnic minorities. The university runs access and foundation programmes through an international network of associated universities and further education colleges, and has the highest intake of foreign students in the Birmingham area.    History     Birmingham Institute of Art and Design  The Birmingham Institute of Art and Design (BIAD) was the art and design faculty of Birmingham City University.  It has now been merged into the university's Faculty of Arts, Design and Media, and is based at the Birmingham City University City Centre Campus and the Birmingham School of Art on Margaret Street.  The main BIAD campus and library is located at The Parkside Building, just north of Birmingham city centre, and about three-quarters of a mile from both Birmingham New Street station and the Custard Factory. It is adjacent to Aston University.    Institute history  BIAD reached its full maturity in the 1890s, as the Birmingham Municipal School of Art at Margaret Street, under the leadership of Edward R. Taylor. BIAD's archives hold extensive records on the history of art and design in Birmingham, and 20 similar collections have also been deposited with the archives.    School of Art   The Birmingham School of Art was originally a municipal art school but was absorbed by Birmingham Polytechnic in 1971 and then became a part of the BIAD in 1988. Its Grade I listed building located on Margaret Street remains the home of the university's Department of Fine Art and is still commonly referred to by its original title. It currently houses the Centre for Fine Art Research (CFAR).    Birmingham School of Architecture  The Birmingham School of Architecture facility was opened in 1908.    Birmingham Polytechnic  In the 1960s, changes were made to the higher education system creating an expansion of polytechnics as a more vocationally orientated alternative to the typical university. The City of Birmingham Education Committee was invited to submit a scheme for the establishment of a polytechnic bringing together a number of different colleges in the city in 1967. Late in 1969, the post of director of the polytechnic was advertised. Although the city lagged behind other parts of the country, Birmingham finally gained a polytechnic in 1971—then the 27th in the UK—designated by the Education Secretary Margaret Thatcher as the City of Birmingham Polytechnic. This was the second polytechnic in Birmingham, the first – Birmingham Polytechnic Institution – having existed in the mid-19th century for ten years.  It was formed initially out of five colleges. Some of the colleges' staff fought against the merger but later changed their minds. The colleges were:  Birmingham College of Art and Design (originally the Birmingham Government School of Design, founded in October 1843); Birmingham School of Music (developed as a department of the Birmingham and Midland Institute around 1859); Birmingham College of Commerce (established in the early 20th century as a branch school of the Birmingham Central Technical College, which went on to become Aston University); South Birmingham Technical College (opened in 1961); North Birmingham Technical College (formerly Aston Technical College, opened in 1966). The latter's new Perry Barr campus (which began construction in 1971) became the centre of the new Polytechnic, although the institution continued to have a number of different campuses spread across the city. This has sometimes been seen as a weakness of the polytechnic, with the dispersal of sites considered confusing to visitors.  In the early 1970s, the Perry Barr campus was the site of building work for what later became the centrepiece of the polytechnic: the Attwood and Baker buildings. Later in the 1970s, the campus was increased in size with the building of what later became the Cox, Dawson, Edge, Feeney and Galton buildings. In the early 1980s, the William Kenrick Library was added to the site. Joseph Chamberlain (8 July 1836 – 2 July 1914) was a British statesman who was first a radical Liberal, then, after opposing home rule for Ireland, a Liberal Unionist, and eventually served as a leading imperialist in coalition with the Conservatives. He split both major British parties in the course of his career. Chamberlain made his career in Birmingham, first as a manufacturer of screws and then as a notable mayor of the city. He was a radical Liberal Party member and an opponent of the Elementary Education Act 1870 on the basis that it could result in subsidising Church of England schools with local ratepayers' money. As a self-made businessman, he had never attended university and had contempt for the aristocracy. He entered the House of Commons at 39 years of age, relatively late in life compared to politicians from more privileged backgrounds. Rising to power through his influence with the Liberal grassroots organisation, he served as President of the Board of Trade in Gladstone's Second Government (1880–85). At the time, Chamberlain was notable for his attacks on the Conservative leader Lord Salisbury, and in the 1885 general election he proposed the \"Unauthorised Programme\", which was not enacted, of benefits for newly enfranchised agricultural labourers, including the slogan promising \"three acres and a cow\". Chamberlain resigned from Gladstone's Third Government in 1886 in opposition to Irish Home Rule. He helped to engineer a Liberal Party split and became a Liberal Unionist, a party which included a bloc of MPs based in and around Birmingham. From the 1895 general election the Liberal Unionists were in coalition with the Conservative Party, under Chamberlain's former opponent Lord Salisbury. In that government Chamberlain promoted the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897. He served as Secretary of State for the Colonies, promoting a variety of schemes to build up the Empire in Asia, Africa, and the West Indies. He had major responsibility for causing the Second Boer War (1899–1902) in South Africa and was the government minister most responsible for the war effort. He became a dominant figure in the Unionist Government's re-election at the \"Khaki Election\" in 1900. In 1903, he resigned from the Cabinet to campaign for tariff reform (i.e. taxes on imports as opposed to the existing policy of free trade with no tariffs). He obtained the support of most Unionist MPs for this stance, but the Unionists suffered a landslide defeat at the 1906 general election. Shortly after public celebrations of his 70th birthday in Birmingham, he was disabled by a stroke, ending his public career. Despite never becoming Prime Minister, he was one of the most important British politicians of his day, as well as a renowned orator and municipal reformer. Historian David Nicholls notes that his personality was not attractive: he was arrogant and ruthless and much hated. He never succeeded in his grand ambitions. However, he was a highly proficient grassroots organizer of democratic instincts, and played the central role in winning the Second Boer War. He is most famous for setting the agenda of British colonial, foreign, tariff and municipal policies, and for deeply splitting both major political parties.

He is most famous for setting the agenda of British colonial, foreign, tariff and municipal policies, and for deeply splitting both major political parties. Future Prime Minister Winston Churchill remarked that despite never being prime minister, Chamberlain \"made the political weather\".    Early life, business career, and family life  Chamberlain was born on Camberwell Grove in Camberwell to Joseph Chamberlain (1796–1874), a successful shoe manufacturer, and Caroline (1806–1875), daughter of cheese (formerly beer) merchant Henry Harben. His younger brother was Richard Chamberlain, later also a Liberal politician. Raised at Highbury, a prosperous suburb of North London, he was educated at University College School 1850–1852, excelling academically and gaining prizes in French and mathematics. The elder Chamberlain was not able to provide advanced education for all his children, and at the age of 16 Joseph was apprenticed to the Worshipful Company of Cordwainers and worked for the family business (their warehouse having been at Milk Street, London for three generations) making quality leather shoes. At 18 he joined his uncle's screw-making business, Nettlefolds of Birmingham, in which his father had invested. The company became known as Nettlefold and Chamberlain when Chamberlain became a partner with Joseph Nettlefold. \"May you live in interesting times\" is an English expression that is claimed to be a translation of a traditional Chinese curse. The expression is ironic: \"interesting\" times are usually times of trouble.\nDespite being so common in English as to be known as the \"Chinese curse\", the saying is apocryphal, and no actual Chinese source has ever been produced. The most likely connection to Chinese culture may be deduced from analysis of the late-19th-century speeches of Joseph Chamberlain, probably erroneously transmitted and revised through his son Austen Chamberlain.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nDespite the phrase being widely attributed as a Chinese curse, there is no known equivalent expression in Chinese. The nearest related Chinese expression translates as \"Better to be a dog in times of tranquility than a human in times of chaos.\" (寧為太平犬，不做亂世人) The expression originates from Volume 3 of the 1627 short story collection by Feng Menglong, Stories to Awaken the World.\nEvidence that the phrase was in use as early as 1936 is provided in a memoir written by Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China in 1936 and 1937, and published in 1949. He mentions that before he left England for China in 1936, a friend told him of a Chinese curse, \"May you live in interesting times.\"\nThe phrase is again described as a \"Chinese curse\" in an article published in Child Study: A Journal of Parent Education in 1943.\nFrederic René Coudert Jr. also recounts having heard the phrase at the time:\n\nSome years ago, in 1936, I had to write to a very dear and honoured friend of mine, who has since died, Sir Austen Chamberlain, brother of the present Prime Minister, and I concluded my letter with a rather banal remark \"that we were living in an interesting age\". Evidently he read the whole letter, because by return mail he wrote to me and concluded as follows: \"Many years ago I learned from one of our diplomats in China that one of the principal Chinese curses heaped upon an enemy is, 'May you live in an interesting age.'\" \"Surely\", he said, \"no age has been more fraught with insecurity than our own present time.\" That was three years ago.\n\n\n== \"Chamberlain curse\" theory ==\nResearch by philologist Garson O'Toole shows a probable origin in the mind of Austen Chamberlain's father Joseph Chamberlain dating around the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Specifically, O'Toole cites the following statement Joseph made during a speech in 1898:\n\nI think that you will all agree that we are living in most interesting times. (Hear, hear.) I never remember myself a time in which our history was so full, in which day by day brought us new objects of interest, and, let me say also, new objects for anxiety. (Hear, hear.) [emphasis added]\nOver time, the Chamberlain family may have come to believe that the elder Chamberlain had not used his own phrase, but had repeated a phrase from Chinese.\n\n\n== Trilogy ==\nThe curse is sometimes presented as the first in a trilogy. Terry Pratchett is quoted as saying\n\nThe phrase \"may you live in interesting times\" is the lowest in a trilogy of Chinese curses that continue \"may you come to the attention of those in authority\" and finish with \"may the gods give you everything you ask for.\" I have no idea about its authenticity.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese word for \"crisis\"\nInteresting Times, a Terry Pratchett novel\nThis phrase was used as a title for the 2019 edition of the Venice Biennale exhibition\nCan't Help Myself\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStephen E.

Arthur Neville Chamberlain  (; 18 March 1869 – 9 November 1940) was a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from May 1937 to May 1940 and Leader of the Conservative Party from May 1937 to October 1940. He is best known for his foreign policy of appeasement, and in particular for his signing of the Munich Agreement on 30 September 1938, ceding the German-speaking Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany led by Adolf Hitler. Following the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, which marked the beginning of the Second World War, Chamberlain announced the declaration of war on Germany two days later and led the United Kingdom through the first eight months of the war until his resignation as prime minister on 10 May 1940. After working in business and local government, and after a short spell as Director of National Service in 1916 and 1917, Chamberlain followed his father Joseph Chamberlain and elder half-brother Austen Chamberlain in becoming a Member of Parliament in the 1918 general election for the new Birmingham Ladywood division at the age of 49. He declined a junior ministerial position, remaining a backbencher until 1922. He was rapidly promoted in 1923 to Minister of Health and then Chancellor of the Exchequer. After a short-lived Labour-led government, he returned as Minister of Health, introducing a range of reform measures from 1924 to 1929. He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the National Government in 1931. Chamberlain succeeded Stanley Baldwin as prime minister on 28 May 1937. His premiership was dominated by the question of policy towards an increasingly aggressive Germany, and his actions at Munich were widely popular among the British at the time. In response to Hitler's continued aggression, Chamberlain pledged the United Kingdom to defend Poland's independence if the latter were attacked, an alliance that brought his country into war after the German invasion of Poland. The failure of Allied forces to prevent the German invasion of Norway caused the House of Commons to hold the historic Norway Debate in May 1940. Chamberlain's conduct of the war was heavily criticised by members of all parties and, in a vote of confidence, his government's majority was greatly reduced. Accepting that a national government supported by all the main parties was essential, Chamberlain resigned the premiership because the Labour and Liberal parties would not serve under his leadership. Although he still led the Conservative Party, he was succeeded as prime minister by his colleague Winston Churchill. Until ill health forced him to resign on 22 September 1940, Chamberlain was an important member of the war cabinet as Lord President of the Council, heading the government in Churchill's absence. His support for Churchill proved vital during the May 1940 war cabinet crisis. Chamberlain died aged 71 on 9 November of cancer, six months after leaving the premiership. Chamberlain's reputation remains controversial among historians, the initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as Guilty Men, published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill in The Gathering Storm. Some later historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the thirty-year rule and arguing that going to war with Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was unprepared. Nonetheless, Chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst British prime ministers.    Early life and political career (1869–1918)     Childhood and businessman   Chamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in a house called Southbourne in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham. He was the only son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain, who later became Mayor of Birmingham and a Cabinet minister. His mother was Florence Kenrick, a cousin of William Kenrick MP; she died when he was a small boy. Joseph Chamberlain had had another son, Austen Chamberlain, by his first marriage. The Chamberlain family were Unitarian, though Joseph lost personal religious faith by the time Neville was six years old and never required religious adherence of his children. Neville, who disliked attending worship services of any kind and showed no interest in organised religion, described himself as a Unitarian with no stated faith and also a \"reverent agnostic\". Neville Chamberlain was educated at home by his elder sister Beatrice Chamberlain and later at Rugby School. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College, now the University of Birmingham. Neville Chamberlain had little interest in his studies there, and in 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months he became a salaried employee. LeRoy D. Brown was the first president of University of Nevada. Birmingham Newman University is a public university based in the suburb of Bartley Green in Birmingham, England. The university was founded in 1968 as Newman College of Higher Education. From 2008 to 2013, it was known as Newman University College, gaining full university status in 2013. From 2013 to 2023, it was known as Newman University and Birmingham Newman University in 2023.    History  The university is named after the 19th-century religious figure John Henry Newman, who had strong links with the city of Birmingham as an Oratorian and a member of the Birmingham Oratory. His view of a university was of a scholarly community wherein the focus should be on training the mind to think rather than the simple diffusion of knowledge. In 1965, the Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham, George Patrick Dwyer, donated land in Bartley Green that was once the site of Athol House Farm for the purposes of building a teacher training college. In 1966, while under construction, the college appointed Simon Quinlan as its first principal and Joe Blackledge as vice principal. At its opening, the college was the first mixed-gender institution under lay control. The college accepted its first group of 182 students in 1968. Initially, the college's degree qualifications were awarded by University of Birmingham. In 1983, under threat of closure, the college entered into an agreement with nearby Westhill College to share facilities. This relationship ended abruptly in 1998 when Coventry University started to award all degrees and Westhill College was absorbed into the University of Birmingham. Between 2003 and 2008, the University of Leicester validated all degrees at the college. The Privy Council gave the institution degree-awarding powers in 2007 finally marking the institution's independence.  Between the years 2000 and 2008, the college expanded, student numbers increasing by 112%. Originally called Newman College of Higher Education, the college was established as a centre for the training of teachers for local primary and secondary schools. The institution changed its name to Newman University College in January 2008, to Newman University in 2013 and to Birmingham Newman University in 2023. Upon receiving university status, then principal, Professor Peter Lutzeier, commented 'it has been a long road to get here but achieving full university status provides welcome recognition for the quality of Newman's courses, graduates and staff'.    Student population  In 2005, nearly half of the institution's students were from low-participation groups and 28% from low-participation neighbourhoods. In 2016, according to the analysis in The Sunday Times, Newman had the third highest working class intake, the second highest state school intake of all universities in the UK. The same survey showed that 1 in 3 of Newman's students is a mature student.    Campus  The university campus is located in Bartley Green about 8 miles (12.9 km) south-west of the city centre. It overlooks the Bartley Reservoir.  The campus is designed around a series of inner quadrangles near academic, administrative, and pastoral buildings. The buildings on campus are named after people with a local historical significance and/or an educational significance to Birmingham Newman University. The quads are named after women who have made a significant contribution to Birmingham and the Halls of Residence are named after places of significance to John Henry Newman. Much of the Campus dates back to the original foundation of the college in the 1960s interspersed with more recent developments. \tBirmingham Newman University, Campus \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t St Mary's Chapel is located in the middle of the campus and offers chaplaincy support to those of any faith and spaces for religious exercise or contemplation. In 2016, the chapel was refurbished and a large extension added to the south side of the building to provide additional teaching spaces. Students have a number of choices for where to eat on Campus in addition to shops and takeaway restaurants on Genners Lane. The Sanctuary acts as the main refectory where hot and cold meals are served throughout the day. The Senses Bar is on the northern side of the campus The Atrium cafe serves Starbucks coffee and other snacks on the south side of campus.In 2013, the university invested £20 million in developing parts of the campus, including a new library and entrance named the St Chad Building.

Founded in 1969 and part of the University of Alabama System, UAB has grown to be the state's largest employer, with more than 24,200 faculty and staff and over 53,000 jobs at the university. The university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". UAB offers 140 programs of study in 12 academic divisions leading to bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and professional degrees. In the fall of 2020, UAB enrolled 22,563 students from more than 110 countries. The UAB Health System, one of the largest academic medical centers in the United States, is affiliated with UAB. The UAB athletic teams known as the Blazers compete in 18 varsity-level sports in the NCAA Division 1 - American Athletic Conference. Its official varsity colors are green and gold. The Blazers have won 11 conference championships to date.    History  In 1936, in response to the rapid growth of the Birmingham metropolitan area and the need for the population to have access to a university education, the University of Alabama established the Birmingham Extension Center. The center operated in an old house in downtown Birmingham at 2131 6th Avenue North and enrolled 116 students. In 1945, UA's newly established four-year School of Medicine moved from Tuscaloosa to Birmingham and took over management of Jefferson and Hillman hospitals. In 1957 enrollment at the extension center stood at 1,856. By 1959, research grants, training grants, and fellowships exceeded $1 million, and ground was broken for a new Children's Hospital. By the 1960s, it grew apparent that the extension center was becoming a university in its own right. An engineering building was built close to the medical center in 1962. In September 1966, the Extension Center was renamed the College of General Studies and elevated to a full four-year program. That November, the College of General Studies and the School of Medicine were merged into the University of Alabama in Birmingham, with Dr. Joseph Volker as \"Vice President for Birmingham Affairs\"–reflecting that it was still treated as an offsite department of the main campus in Tuscaloosa. An Advisory Board for UAB was created in 1967. In 1969, the legislature created the University of Alabama System. UAB became one of three four-year institutions within the new system, which also included UA and the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) in Huntsville. Volker became UAB's first president.    Campus   UAB is located on the Southside neighborhood of downtown Birmingham, Alabama, occupying more than 100 city blocks and surrounded by three historic district neighborhood including the Five Point South, Glen Iris, and the Southside. There is a blend of public and private property inside the university limits. I-65, 10th, 11th, and 12th Avenues South, 22nd Street South, and 2nd Avenue South are the boundaries of UAB campus. The campus has more than 216 academic, residential, and recreational facilities spread across around 636 acres, or roughly 16 million square feet of building area.    The UAB strategic plan's pillars are supported by the campus master plan, which places an emphasis on innovative facilities and improved growth management. The campus master plan also includes the creation of eight zones concentration locations: Academics, Athletics & Recreation, Cultural, Hospital/Highlands, Residential, Research, Southern Research, and Support with overlapping zone areas of collaboration such as Academic, Research, and Hospital. Honors Hall, the Collat School of Business, the School of Nursing, University Hall, Gold Hall, McMahon Hall, McCallum Basic Health Science Building, Early Learning Center, and the Technology Innovation Center are amongst the recently completed building construction projects on the university. The Science and Engineering Complex's second phase project, the Altec/Styslinger Genomic Medicine & Data Sciences Building, the Marnix E. Heersink Institute for Biomedical Innovation Conference Center, Biomedical Research and Psychology Building, Unity Park, Department of Art and Art History, Cooper Green Mercy Health, University Emergency Department, Rehabilitation Pavilion, 14th Street Parking Deck, and the Southern Research Biotechnology Building are among the ongoing constructions in the university. Since 2013, about 1.1 million gross square feet of new facilities have been added to UAB's footprint through the completion or ongoing development of 17 major university construction projects.

It was built in 2008 and considered to be the focal point of the campus. Birmingham (  BUR-ming-əm) is a city and metropolitan borough in the metropolitan county of West Midlands in England. It is the second-largest city in Britain – commonly referred to as the second city of the United Kingdom – with a population of 1.145 million in the city proper. Birmingham borders the Black Country to its west and, together with the city of Wolverhampton and towns including Dudley and Solihull, forms the West Midlands conurbation. The royal town of Sutton Coldfield is incorporated within the city limits to the northeast. The wider metropolitan area has a population of 4.3 million, making it the largest outside of London. Located in the West Midlands region of England, Birmingham is considered to be the social, cultural, financial and commercial centre of the Midlands. It is just west of the traditional centre point of England at Meriden, and is the most inland major city in the country, and lying north of the Cotswolds and east of the Shropshire Hills. Distinctively, Birmingham only has small rivers flowing through it, mainly the River Tame and its tributaries River Rea and River Cole – one of the closest main rivers is the Severn, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of the city centre. The city does however have numerous canals, collectively named the Birmingham Canal Navigations. Historically a market town in Warwickshire in the medieval period, Birmingham grew during the 18th century during the Midlands Enlightenment and during the Industrial Revolution, which saw advances in science, technology and economic development, producing a series of innovations that laid many of the foundations of modern industrial society. By 1791, it was being hailed as \"the first manufacturing town in the world\". Birmingham's distinctive economic profile, with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly skilled trades, encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation; this provided an economic base for prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century. The Watt steam engine was invented in Birmingham. The resulting high level of social mobility also fostered a culture of political radicalism which, under leaders from Thomas Attwood to Joseph Chamberlain, was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy. From the summer of 1940 to the spring of 1943, Birmingham was bombed heavily by the German Luftwaffe in what is known as the Birmingham Blitz. The damage done to the city's infrastructure, in addition to a deliberate policy of demolition and new building by planners, led to extensive urban regeneration in subsequent decades. Birmingham's economy is now dominated by the service sector. The city is a major international commercial centre and an important transport, retail, events and conference hub. Its metropolitan economy is the second-largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $121.1bn (2014). Its five universities, including the University of Birmingham, make it the largest centre of higher education in the country outside London. Birmingham's major cultural institutions – the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Birmingham Royal Ballet, Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Library of Birmingham and Barber Institute of Fine Arts – enjoy international reputations, and the city has vibrant and influential grassroots art, music, literary and culinary scenes. Birmingham was the host city for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. In 2021, Birmingham was the third most visited city in the UK by people from foreign nations.    Toponymy  The name Birmingham comes from the Old English Beormingahām, meaning the home or settlement of the Beormingas – a tribe or clan whose name means 'Beorma's people' and which may have formed an early unit of Anglo-Saxon administration. Beorma, after whom the tribe was named, could have been its leader at the time of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, a shared ancestor, or a mythical tribal figurehead. Place names ending in -ingahām are characteristic of primary settlements established during the early phases of Anglo-Saxon colonisation of an area, suggesting that Birmingham was probably in existence by the early 7th century at the latest. Surrounding settlements with names ending in -tūn ('farm'), -lēah ('woodland clearing'), -worð ('enclosure') and -field ('open ground') are likely to be secondary settlements created by the later expansion of the Anglo-Saxon population, in some cases possibly on earlier British sites.    History     Pre-history and medieval  There is evidence of early human activity in the Birmingham area dating back to around 8000 BC, with Stone Age artefacts suggesting seasonal settlements, overnight hunting parties and woodland activities such as tree felling.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

It was written by Philippe Sollers and produced by Barbet Schroeder, with music by Antione Duhamel. The 45 minute film is cited as one of Pollet's most influential films, which according to Jonathan Rosenbaum directly influenced Jean-Luc Goddard's \"Contempt\", released later the same year. Footage for the film was shot around the Mediterranean, including at a Greek temple, a Sicilian garden, the sea, and also features a fisherman, a bullfighter, and a girl on an operating table.  Jean-Daniel Pollet (1936–2004) was a French film director and screenwriter who was most active in the 1960s and 1970s. He was associated with two approaches to filmmaking: comedies which blended burlesque and melancholic elements, and poetic films based on texts by writers such as the French poet Francis Ponge. == Career ==\nPollet was born on 20 June 1936 in La Madeleine, Nord, in France. His film career started in 1958, when he did a short film set in Paris called Pourvu qu'on ait l'ivresse..., in which Pollet filmed the movements of dancers' silhouettes. Pollet built on the images and themes from this first film in many of his later works, by incorporating elements of popular comedies imbued with both burlesque and melancholic elements. In the early 1960s, Pollet began exploring another approach to filmmaking with the film Méditerranée, which he made over two years with Volker Schlöndorff. Pollet tried to create a form of poetic film, using texts and commentaries by writers such as Philippe Sollers, Jean Thibeaudeau, and Francis Ponge.\nIn the 1990s, he was paralyzed after a train accident, and so he filmed his last movies in the areas around his house in the French town of Cadenet. In 2004, when Pollet realized that his death was approaching, he wrote his last screenplay, Jour après jour, which was finished by Jean-Paul Fargier. Pollet died at the age of 68 on 9 September 2004 at Cadenet, Vaucluse, in France.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n1958: Pourvu qu'on ait l'ivresse...\n1960:  Line of Sight\n1961: Gala\n1963: Méditerranée\n1964: Bassae\n1965: Une balle au cœur\n1965: Paris vu par...

It stars Brigitte Bardot, Michel Piccoli, Jack Palance, Fritz Lang, and Giorgia Moll.    Plot  Paul Javal, a young French playwright who has found commercial success in Rome, accepts an offer from vulgar American producer Jerry Prokosch to rework the script for German director Fritz Lang's screen adaptation of the Odyssey. Paul's wife, Camille Javal, joins him on the first day of the project at Cinecittà. As the first discussions are completed, Prokosch invites the crew to join him at his villa, offering Camille a ride in his two-seat sportscar. Camille looks to Paul to decline the offer, but he submissively withdraws to follow by taxi, leaving Camille and Prokosch alone. Paul does not catch up with them until 30 minutes later, explaining that he was delayed by a traffic accident. Camille grows uneasy, secretly doubting his honesty and suspecting that he is using her to cement his ties with Prokosch. Her misgivings are heightened when she sees Paul grope Prokosch's secretary, Francesca. Back at their apartment, Paul and Camille discuss the subtle uneasiness that has come between them in the first few hours of the project, and Camille suddenly announces to her bewildered husband that she no longer loves him. Hoping to rekindle Camille's love, Paul convinces her to accept Prokosch's invitation to join them for filming in Capri. Prokosch and Lang are locked in a conflict over the correct interpretation of Homer's work, an impasse exacerbated by the difficulty of communication between the German director, French script writer, and American producer. Francesca acts as interpreter, mediating all conversations. When Paul sides with Prokosch against Lang by suggesting that Odysseus actually left home because of his wife's infidelity, Camille's suspicions of her husband's servility are confirmed. She deliberately allows him to find her in Prokosch's embrace, and in the ensuing confrontation she implies that her respect for him has turned to contempt because he has bartered her to Prokosch. He denies this suggestion, offering to sever his connection with the film and leave Capri; but she will not recant and leaves for Rome with the producer. After a car crash in which Camille and Prokosch are killed, Paul prepares to leave Capri and return to the theater. Lang continues to work on the film.    Cast  Brigitte Bardot as Camille Javal Michel Piccoli as Paul Javal Jack Palance as Jeremiah Prokosch Giorgia Moll as Francesca Vanini Fritz Lang as himself Raoul Coutard as the cameraman Jean-Luc Godard as Lang's assistant director Linda Veras as a Siren    Production  Italian film producer Carlo Ponti approached Godard to discuss a possible collaboration; Godard suggested an adaptation of Moravia's novel Il disprezzo (originally translated into English with the title A Ghost at Noon) in which he saw Kim Novak and Frank Sinatra as the leads; they refused. Ponti suggested Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, whom Godard refused. Anna Karina (by then Godard's former wife) later revealed that the director had traveled to Rome to ask Monica Vitti if she would portray the female lead. However the Italian actress reportedly turned up an hour late, \"staring out the window like she wasn't interested at all\". Finally, Bardot was chosen because of the producer's insistence that the profits might be increased by displaying her famously sensual body. This provided the film's opening scene, filmed by Godard as a typical mockery of the cinema business with tame nudity. The scene was shot after Godard considered the film finished, at the insistence of the American co-producers. In the film, Godard cast himself as Lang's assistant director, and characteristically has Lang expound many of Godard's New Wave theories and opinions. Godard also employed the two \"forgotten\" New Wave filmmakers, Luc Moullet and Jacques Rozier, on the film. Bardot visibly reads a book about Fritz Lang that was written by Moullet, and Rozier made the documentary short about the making of the film Le Parti des Choses. Godard admitted to changing the original novel, \"but with full permission\" of Moravia, the original writer. Among his changes were focusing the action to only a few days and changing the writer character from being \"silly and soft. Club Med SAS, commonly known as Club Med and previously known as Club Méditerranée SA, is a French travel and tourism operator headquartered in Paris, specializing in all-inclusive holidays. Founded in 1950, the company has been primarily owned by the Chinese conglomerate Fosun Group since 2013. Club Med either wholly owns or operates nearly eighty all-inclusive resort villages in holiday locations around the world.    History     Foundation  The club was founded in 1950 by Belgian entrepreneur Gérard Blitz.  Blitz had opened a low-priced summer colony of tents on the Spanish island of Majorca, followed by another on the island of Djerba (Tunisia). A better entertainer than businessman, Blitz went bankrupt in 1953. His main creditor was his tent supplier Gilbert Trigano, the French \"King of Camping;\" Trigano took control of the club and slowly pushed Blitz aside. The first official Club Med was built the next year in Palinuro, Salerno,  Italy. The original villages were simple: Members stayed in unlit straw huts on a beachfront, sharing communal washing facilities. Such villages have been replaced with modern blocks or huts with ensuite facilities.    Expansion  Because of reckless spending, the club was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1961. It was saved by the 35-year-old Baron Edmond de Rothschild after he had visited a resort and enjoyed his stay. With Rothschild financing, the number of villages increased greatly under Trigano's leadership from 1963 to 1993. Winter villages, providing skiing and winter sports tuition, were introduced in 1956 at Leysin, Switzerland. In 1965, the first club outside the Mediterranean was opened in Tahiti. Club Med broadened its reach by opening villages in the French Caribbean (Guadeloupe and Martinique).  Originally attracting mainly singles and young couples, the club later became primarily a destination for families, with the first Mini Club opening in 1967. Club Méditerranée S.A. had a branch in the USA named Club Méditerranée Inc, with several partners including Crédit Lyonnais and American Express. In 1974, upon his arrival as the new CEO of the club for North America, Jean Lallement, one of the first members of the club and responsible for its large presence in Italy, hired as marketing manager the French HEC Jacques Bacon, who made the club a huge success within 3 years through an aggressive and very efficient promotion; it was he who suggested the name Club Med. The new name was at that time reserved to the North American market, but later became the name of the mother company as well.  In the early 1970s the club had bought from her owner Claude Lelouche the famous revolutionary three-mast sailing boat Vendredi 13, installed 4 berths and a bath-room,  and based her at the Buccaneer's Creek village in Martinique for one-day to several day cruises. Huge success among members, so, in 1976, it bought the huge sailing boat built by solo sailor Alain Colas, who had just lost the Solo Transatlantic Race Plymouth-Newport to his enemy Eric Tabarly. It renamed it Club Médiderranée and based it in Martinique for 2-3-day cruises.  Another huge success, so, the club built a second one, a monster named Club Med 2.  The club has also ceased to be a club in the legal sense, changing from a not-for-profit association to a for-profit public limited company (French SA) in 1995. However, each new customer is still charged a membership fee upon joining, and returning customers are charged an annual fee as well.    Diversification  In the 1990s, the club's fortunes declined because competitors copied its concepts and holidaymakers demanded more sophisticated offerings. Other reasons explain its demise: the arrogance of the Triganos, who were convinced that they could buy any property, even one in a bad location, put on it the name \"Club Med\" and it would be a success; they multiplied the villages, so many so fast that they could not find enough good \"chefs de village\", who make the villages what they are: bad chef  bad village. In 1997, the shareholders finally understood and sacked the two Triganos and replaced them with Philippe Bourguignon, former CEO of Novotel USA. Bourguignon aimed to change the club \"from a holiday village company to a services company\". The club took over a chain of French gyms, launched bar/restaurant complexes known as Club Med World in Paris and Montreal, and commenced a budget resort concept aimed at young adults. Oyyo was the first such resort, opened at Monastir in Tunisia. Howard Winchel Koch( April 11, 1916 – February 16, 2001) was an American producer and director of film and television.

The film is predicated on the irresistible appeal of its nymphet heroine and on the assumption that her first fumblings towards maturity are of riveting psychological interest; but since she is surrounded by a family of cutely kooky characters ... it is hard to take problems seriously, the more so since the unbelievably fey dialogue with which she is saddled ...does little to elucidate the processes of the adolescent mind at work. Susan George, who has elsewhere shown herself an actress of some promise, can do little with the part which, with the camera moving in for close-up after close-up of her tossing blonde hair, takes on the nightmare quality of a ninety-minute shampoo commercial.\"\nThe Radio Times Guide to Films gave the film 1/5 stars, writing: \"Richard Donner directs this abysmal relic from Swinging London that not even its distinguished supporting cast can salvage. Susan George plays a 16-year-old schoolgirl who elopes with an American novelist played by Charles Bronson. Both sets of parents are appalled. The audience is, too.\"\nThe Contemporary North American Film Directors: A Wallflower Critical Guide state that the film exploited \"the sexual freedom of its era\", describing Susan George's character as a \"naive young nymphet\".\nLeslie Halliwell said: \"Dreary sex comedy drama, the fag end of London's swinging sixties.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLola at IMDb Pollet is a surname.

She is the only performer to win five César Awards for acting—all in the Best Actress category—for Possession (1981), One Deadly Summer (1983), Camille Claudel (1988), La Reine Margot (1994), and Skirt Day (2009). She was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 2010 and a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters in 2014. Her portrayal of Adèle Hugo in The Story of Adèle H. (1975) earned Adjani her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, which made her, at 20, the youngest nominee in that category at the time. Her second Best Actress nomination came in 1990 for portraying Camille Claudel, making her the first French actress to receive two Academy Award nominations for foreign-language films. She won the Cannes Film Festival Award for her performances in Possession and Quartet (1981), becoming the only actress to win a joint award for two films in the same competition slate, and a Berlin Silver Bear for Camille Claudel.  Her other notable film roles include The Slap (1974), The Tenant (1975), Barocco (1976), The Driver (1978), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979), All Fired Up (1982), Subway (1985), Ishtar (1987), Diabolique (1996), Adolphe (2002), Bon voyage (2003), French Women (2014), The World Is Yours (2018) and Peter von Kant (2022).    Early life and education  Isabelle Yasmine Adjani was born on 27 June 1955 in the 17th arrondissement of Paris, to  Mohammed  Cherif Adjani, an Algerian Muslim from Constantine, and Emma Augusta \"Gusti\" Schweinberger, a German Catholic from Bavaria. Adjani's parents met near the end of World War II, when her father was in the French Army and stationed in Germany. They married and her mother returned with him to Paris, despite not speaking a word of French. She asked him to take Cherif as his first name as she thought it sounded more \"American\". Isabelle grew up bilingual, speaking French and German fluently, in Gennevilliers, a northwestern suburb of Paris, where her father worked in a garage. After winning a school recitation contest, Adjani began acting by the age of 12 in amateur theater. She successfully passed her baccalauréat and was auditing classes at the University of Vincennes in 1976. Adjani had a younger brother, Éric, who was a photographer. He died on 25 December 2010, aged 53.    Acting career   At the age of 14, Adjani starred in her first motion picture, Le Petit Bougnat (1970). She first gained fame as a classical actress at the Comédie-Française, which she joined in 1972. She was praised for her interpretation of Agnès, the main female role in Molière's L'École des femmes. She soon left the theatre to pursue a film career. After minor roles in several films, she enjoyed modest success in the 1974 film La Gifle (The Slap), which François Truffaut saw. He immediately cast her in her first major role in his The Story of Adèle H. (1975) which he had finished writing five years prior. Critics praised her performance, with the American critic Pauline Kael describing her acting talents as \"prodigious\". Only 19 when she made the film, Adjani was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, becoming the youngest Best Actress nominee at the time (a record she held for almost 30 years). She quickly received offers for roles in Hollywood films, such as Walter Hill's 1978 crime thriller The Driver. She had previously turned down the chance to star in films like The Other Side of Midnight. She had described Hollywood as a \"city of fiction\" and said, \"I'm not an American. I didn't grow up with that will to win an award.\" Truffaut on the other hand said, \"France is too small for her. I think Isabelle is made for American cinema.\" She agreed to make The Driver because she was an admirer of Hill's first film Hard Times. Adjani said:  I think he is wonderful, very much in the tradition of Howard Hawks, lean and spare. The story is contemporary but also very stylized, and the roles that Ryan and I play are like Bogart and Bacall. We are both gamblers in our souls and we do not show our emotions or say a lot. For us, talk is cheap. Hanro Smitsman, born in 1967 in Breda( Netherlands), is a writer and director of film and television.

Filmed in Cinemascope and directed by Burt Balaban and Stuart Rosenberg, the film was based on the true story of Murder, Inc., a Brooklyn gang that operated in the 1930s. Falk was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his first major feature role as Abe Reles, a vicious thug who led the Murder, Inc. gang and was believed to have committed 30 murders, for which he was never prosecuted. In his 2006 autobiography Just One More Thing, Falk said that Murder, Inc. launched his career. This was the first film directed by Rosenberg, who later won acclaim for Cool Hand Luke (1967), and it launched Stuart Whitman's career as a leading man. A highly fictionalized film on the same basic events titled The Enforcer (1951), starring Humphrey Bogart, was released in the United Kingdom with the title Murder, Inc.    Prologue  \"This happened in Brooklyn, The city of churches. The time was the mid – thirties\"\"The story is factual. The people are real.\"    Plot summary  Abe Reles and his accomplice Bug Workman, two cold-blooded killers from Brooklyn's Brownsville district, go to the Garment District to meet with Louis \"Lepke\" Buchalter, leader of the organized crime mob Murder, Inc., who offers them jobs as hit men. After hiring them to kill Catskills resort owner Walter Sage for withholding slot machine profits from the syndicate, Lepke designates Emanuel \"Mendy\" Weiss, his assistant, as Reles' contact. Reles coerces struggling singer Joey Collins, an old friend of Sage indebted to Reles, with veiled threats, and Joey agrees to accompany him to the Catskills, where he draws an unsuspecting Sage out into the street and into Reles' murderous hands.  Upon their return to the city, Reles visits Joey at the apartment he shares with his dancer wife Eadie and coldly announces that he will kill them if they tell anyone about what happened. Aghast, she denounces him and throws him out. Later, at a soda shop, Lieutenant William Flaherty Tobin, a local police detective determined to end the syndicate's reign of terror, arrests him and takes him to the station house for questioning. When they arrive, however, Lepke's attorney Lazlo orders for Reles' release. Resentful towards Eadie, Reles returns while Joey is away and brutally rapes her. When Joey returns, the beaten and disheveled Eadie begs him to escape with her, but he declines out of fear, and she hysterically insists that he leave.  Under Lepke's direction, Reles continues his murderous campaign. One day, at the nightclub in which Eadie performs, he asks her to reconcile with Joey, before taking her to a luxurious apartment filled with stolen goods and offering it to the couple for free. A grand jury impaneled by special prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey soon convenes, forcing Lepke to hide at the couple's dwelling. Lepke soon takes control, mistreating and constantly berating Eadie. He instructs Mendy to personally kill Joe Rosen, a shop owner he had beaten for failing to pay extortion money, to prevent him from testifying. As the NYPD scours the city for Lepke, crime lord Albert Anastasia informs him that per the syndicate's orders, he must turn himself in on a reduced charge of interstate commerce crime. Lepke reluctantly consents, but rather than the two-year prison term promised by Albert, is sentenced to thirty years in Leavenworth. District Attorney Burton Turkus takes over the crusade, enlisting Tobin's help in identifying the players. Initially cynical about his ability to withstand political pressure, Tobin eventually agrees. Lepke, concerned about being linked to Rosen's death, orders Mendy to kill the entire Brownsville gang along with Joey and Eadie. Shell-shocked from being dominated by him, she describes living with the killers to Turkus, identifying Mendy as Lepke's right-hand man and the Brownsville gang as his personal squad, and revealing that Reles will arrive that afternoon on the Baltimore train; he puts her in protective custody and goes to the train station to arrest Reles. Later, as Mendy waits menacingly outside the soda shop to kill Joey, Turkus arrives and hauls Joey into the police station, shows him photographs of Bug's murder and warns that he will be next. Upon learning of Reles' arrest, Joey visits him in jail, notifies him of Bug's death and then threatens to testify against him. Move is a 1970 American comedy film starring Elliott Gould, Paula Prentiss and Geneviève Waïte, and directed by Stuart Rosenberg. The screenplay was written by Joel Lieber and Stanley Hart, adapted from a novel by Lieber. == Plot ==\nThe film covers three days in the life of Hiram Jaffe, a would-be playwright who supplements his living as a porn writer and by walking dogs. He and his wife, Dolly, are moving to a new apartment on New York's Upper West Side. Jaffe is beset by problems, including his inability to persuade the moving man to move the couple's furniture, and retreats into fantasy.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nElliott Gould as Hiram Jaffe\nPaula Prentiss as Dolly Jaffe\nGeneviève Waïte as Girl\nJohn Larch as Patrolman\nJoe Silver as Oscar\nGraham Jarvis as Dr. Picker\nRon O'Neal as Peter\nGarrie Beau as Andrea\nMae Questel Mrs. Katz\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Original novel ===\nThe film was based on Move!, a novel by Joel Lieber which was published in 1968. The Chicago Tribune called the novel \"largely amusing, sometimes puzzling.\" The New York Times called it \"very funny.\"\n\n\n=== Development ===\nIn February 1968, before the novel had been published, 20th Century Fox announced they had bought the screen rights for $85,000. They called it a \"dirty Barefoot in the Park.\" Stuart Rosenberg was to direct, Pandro Berman to produce and Dustin Hoffman to star. Lieber did the first screenplay.\nBy February 1969, the lead had become Elliott Gould. In March, Gould signed a non-exclusive four-picture contract with Fox, the first of which was to be MASH and the second was supposed to be Move. Paula Prentiss signed in July. Shortly after, Genevieve Waite, who had been in Joanna, was announced as the third lead.\nGould was going to make Move after MASH when Columbia came to him with Getting Straight so he delayed the film to do that one. \"Columbia said if I didn't take the part they'd drop it\", he said. \"I was the only actor they'd go with. I was never so flattered in my life.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film was as a box-office failure. However, according to Fox records the film required $4,905,000 in rentals to break even and by 11 December 1970 had made $5,000,000 so made a small profit to the studio.\nRoger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote \"Though I can remember some very good moments, I can also remember too many lapses, loose ends, failures in energy and invention...Both Elliott Gould and Paula Prentiss have been shortchanged by their roles, or by their director—to the extent that often you can catch them apparently waiting (in character) for something to do.\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety wrote \"'Move' walks the tightrope of zany comedy-fantasy, and doesn't it make it across...Gould has to carry the film singlehandedly, and the burden is much too great. Although only 90 minutes, film's pacing is lethargic.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four and wrote that the fantasy sequences didn't work because \"it is not always possible to tell which events are real and which are fantasy. The cause for this is not a clever script, but that one doesn't care to tell the difference. There's no reward. In other words, the central script idea has no meaning other than as a device.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times declared it \"one of those pictures that seem funnier at the time than they are in retrospect, and it has a vivid if familiar central character but virtually no story. It is really but still another variation on '8½,' with a hero in whom you cannot tell when reality leaves off and fantasy begins.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it \"a trifling new comedy vehicle for Elliott Gould. Although it's easy enough to sit through, the picture is so undemanding and insubstantial that it leaves no impression and no aftertaste.\"\nGould later said \"\"there were great elements in it\" but felt Rosenberg while \"a sweet man and a talented filmmaker...Comedy wasn’t his main field. There was a problem with the script, and I would always defer to the writers, to the director. I didn’t know that I might have gotten involved to develop something that might have fused Move.\"\nGould later was offered the lead role in Rosenberg's Pocket Money but turned it down because he did not want to work with Rosenberg again.\nLieber died by suicide in May 1971, aged 35.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1970 Peter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre. The Drowning Pool is a 1975 American mystery thriller film directed by Stuart Rosenberg, and based upon Ross Macdonald's novel of the same name. The film stars Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, and Anthony Franciosa, and is a loose sequel to Harper. The setting is shifted from California to Louisiana.    Plot  Los Angeles-based private investigator Lew Harper flies to Louisiana to do a job for his former lover, Iris Devereaux. She believes the family's ex-chauffeur is the person who is blackmailing her with the knowledge that she has cheated on her husband. The husband, who is a closeted homosexual, does not care, but his mother, Olivia Devereaux, is the family matriarch and runs the family estate with an unforgiving iron grip. Even before his investigation begins, Harper is propositioned in his motel room by a teenaged girl. He sends her away, but later he discovers that the teenager is Iris Devereaux's daughter, Schuyler. Their meeting in the motel room brings Harper to the attention of police chief Broussard and the disagreeable Lieutenant Franks. Broussard accepts Harper's explanation, but tells him he will be following what Harper does, as he has a personal interest in the Devereaux family. Harper is abducted by two hoods working for the oil magnate J.Hugh Kilbourne, who thinks Harper might be useful in his efforts to get ownership of some of Olivia Devereaux's oil-rich properties, which she is content to maintain as bird sanctuaries. Harper is noncommittal towards Kilbourne, and the hoods return him to his car. On Harper's return, he learns that the dead body of Olivia Devereaux has just been found and the police's prime suspect is the ex-chauffeur. While searching for the chauffeur, Harper is abducted again, this time by hoods working for a mysterious woman. He does not have any useful information for her and is released; he later finds out she is Mavis Kilbourne, the wife of the oil magnate. She is working behind her husband's back trying to find an account book containing information of his illicit business dealings, which he is desperate to recover and would kill her over if he knew she had a hand in its disappearance. Harper tracks down the chauffeur, Pat Reavis. He finds Reavis with $10,000 in his possession and believes that Reavis was paid to kill Olivia. He calls the police to say that he's bringing Reavis in and makes Reavis drive at gunpoint. En route, Reavis denies involvement in blackmailing Iris and murdering Olivia, claiming he was only at the scene of the murder because he had been having an affair with Schuyler. However, he admits to having information that he expects will yield a lot of money, and offers Harper a share of it if he will let him go. The car they are in is forced off the road by masked gunmen, who shoot Reavis dead but miss Harper, who wounds one of the gunmen. The next day he is informed by Broussard that, mysteriously, there was no report made to the police of any gunfight, but that Lt. Franks has been injured in a \"hunting accident\". Despite Iris's pleading with him to give up on the case and go home, Harper continues investigating. He correctly deduces that Reavis came into possession of the missing account book and must have given it to a trusted girlfriend for safekeeping. Knowing that Franks was involved in the killing of Reavis, Harper ambushes Franks in his own home and forces him to admit that he does jobs for Kilbourne. When Harper later confronts Kilbourne with the information, the oil magnate admits to having hired Reavis, but insists it was only to spy on Olivia Devereaux, not to kill her. When Harper tells Kilbourne he knows about the missing account book, Kilbourne offers him a fortune for it, but Harper just walks away. This leads to Kilbourne and his henchman kidnapping Harper and Mavis to find out where the notebook is, torturing them with a fire hose in an abandoned asylum. When Harper refuses to give up any information, Kilbourne leaves them overnight to suffer. During this time, Harper uses their clothes to plug the drain, and he and Mavis flood the room in an attempt to reach the skylight. When the water is finally high enough, they find that they can't break the window, and are near drowning when they are ironically saved by Kilbourne returning to torture them more. Harper gives Kilbourne's gun to Mavis, asking her to watch him while Harper finds a phone to call for help. As Kilbourne brags to Harper that he has too much influence and that he'll get away with it all, shots suddenly ring out. Cool Hand Luke is a 1967 American prison drama film directed by Stuart Rosenberg, starring Paul Newman and featuring George Kennedy in an Oscar-winning performance. Newman stars in the title role as Luke, a prisoner in a Florida prison camp who refuses to submit to the system. Set in the early 1950s, it is based on Donn Pearce's 1965 novel Cool Hand Luke. Roger Ebert called Cool Hand Luke an anti-establishment film shot during emerging popular opposition to the Vietnam War. Filming took place within California's San Joaquin River Delta region; the set, imitating a prison farm in the Deep South, was based on photographs and measurements made by a crew the filmmakers sent to a Road Prison in Gainesville, Florida. Upon its release, Cool Hand Luke received favorable reviews and was a box-office success. It cemented Newman's status as one of the era's top actors, and was called the \"touchstone of an era\". Newman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, Kennedy won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Pearce and Pierson were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Lalo Schifrin was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score. In 2005, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, considering it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film has a 100% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, and the prison warden's (Strother Martin) line in the film beginning with \"What we've got here is failure to communicate\" was listed at number 11 on the American Film Institute's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list.    Plot  In early 1950s Florida, decorated World War II veteran Lucas \"Luke\" Jackson drunkenly beheads several parking meters. He is sentenced to two years on a chain gang in a prison camp run by the Captain, a stern warden, and Walking Boss Godfrey, a quiet rifleman nicknamed \"the man with no eyes\" because he always wears mirrored sunglasses. There, even minor violations are punished by \"a night in the box\", a small wooden booth in the prison yard with limited air and space. Luke refuses to observe the established order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of their leader, Dragline. When the two have a boxing match, Luke is severely outmatched but refuses to acquiesce. Eventually, Dragline stops the fight, but Luke's tenacity earns the prisoners' respect and draws the guards' attention. He later wins a poker game by bluffing with a hand worth nothing, and Dragline christens him \"Cool Hand Luke\".  After a visit from his sick mother, Arletta, Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He repeatedly shows defiance to the Captain and the guards, and his sense of humor and independence prove inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than a day. The prisoners start to idolize him after he wins a bet that he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs in an hour. One evening, Luke receives notice that his mother has died. Anticipating that Luke might attempt to escape to attend the funeral, the Captain has him locked in the box. After being released, Luke becomes determined to escape. Under cover of a Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang. The Captain has Luke fitted with leg irons and delivers a warning speech to the inmates.  Shortly afterward, Luke escapes a second time. While free, Luke mails the prison a magazine that includes a photograph of himself with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. The Captain warns Luke that he will be killed if he ever attempts to escape again. Luke becomes annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and says he faked it. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but when Luke returns after a long stay in the box and is punished by being forced to eat a massive serving of rice, the others help him finish it.  For his escape, the guards brutalize Luke to the point of exhaustion, particularly when he is forced to repeatedly dig and refill a grave-sized hole in the prison yard. He eventually breaks down and begs for mercy, losing the respect of his fellow inmates. Luke seems to succumb to cowardice and become an errand boy for the guards, but when an opportunity presents itself, he flees again by stealing a truck, with Dragline joining him. After abandoning the truck, the pair agree to separate. Luke enters a church and talks to God, whom he blames for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Stuart Rosenberg (August 11, 1927 – March 15, 2007) was an American film and television director whose motion pictures include \"Cool Hand Luke\" (1967), \"Voyage of the Damned\" (1976), \"The Amityville Horror\" (1979), and \"The Pope of Greenwich Village\" (1984). He was noted for his work with actor Paul Newman. == Career ==\nAfter advancing to film editor, he began directing with episodes of the television series Decoy (1957–1959), starring Beverly Garland as an undercover police woman. It was the first police series on American television built around a female protagonist. Over the next two years, Rosenberg directed 15 episodes of the police-detective series Naked City (1958–1963), which like Decoy was shot in New York City. Meanwhile, Rosenberg was then hired to direct his first film, Murder, Inc. (1960), starring Peter Falk, but a strike by both the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild resulted in his leaving the film and being replaced by its producer, Burt Balaban. Rosenberg returned to television, directing 15 episodes of The Untouchables, eight of the anthology series Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, five of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and three of The Twilight Zone, along with episodes of Adventures in Paradise, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Ben Casey, Rawhide with Clint Eastwood, and Falk's The Trials of O'Brien. He won a 1963 Emmy Award for directing \"The Madman\", one of his 19 episodes of the courtroom drama The Defenders.\nFollowing the U.S.-German co-production Question 7 (1961), filmed in West Berlin, Rosenberg shot the 1965 TV movie Memorandum for a Spy and the 1966 telefilm Fame Is the Name of the Game, then made his major-studio debut with the Paul Newman hit Cool Hand Luke (1967). Rosenberg had come across Donn Pearce's chain gang novel and developed the film with actor Jack Lemmon's production company Jalem. Years later, Rosenberg replaced Bob Rafelson on the prison movie Brubaker (1980).\nOther Rosenberg films include The April Fools (1969), with French actress Catherine Deneuve in her American debut opposite Jack Lemmon (who plays the first Rosenberg lead character named H. Brubaker); the Newman movies WUSA (1970), Pocket Money (1972) and The Drowning Pool (1975); the Walter Matthau police-detective thriller The Laughing Policeman (1973); the Charles Bronson action picture Love and Bullets (1979); and another action movie Let's Get Harry (1986), for which Rosenberg used the pseudonym Alan Smithee. He was famous for straight dramas and especially crime films. The most acclaimed movie he did after 'Cool Hand Luke' was The Pope of Greenwich Village.\nHe made his last film, the independent drama My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys in 1991.\nIn 1992, Rosenberg became a teacher at the American Film Institute. Among his students were Todd Field, Darren Aronofsky, Mark Waters, Scott Silver, Doug Ellin and Rob Schmidt.\n\n\n== Personal life and legacy ==\nRosenberg died in 2007 of a heart attack at his home in Beverly Hills, California. He was survived by his wife Margot Pohoryles, whom he had met at New York University; son Benjamin Rosenberg, a first assistant director; as well as four grandchildren.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nMurder, Inc.

Based on Arthur Hailey's 1968 novel of the same name, it originated the 1970s disaster film genre. It is also the first of four films in the Airport film series. Produced on a $10 million budget, it earned over $128 million. The supporting cast features Jean Seberg, Jacqueline Bisset, George Kennedy, Helen Hayes, Van Heflin, Maureen Stapleton, Barry Nelson, Lloyd Nolan, Dana Wynter and Barbara Hale. The film is about an airport manager trying to keep his airport open during a snowstorm, while a suicide bomber plots to blow up a Boeing 707 airliner in flight. It takes place at fictional Lincoln International Airport near Chicago. The film was a commercial success and surpassed Spartacus as Universal Pictures' biggest moneymaker. The movie won Helen Hayes an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as an elderly stowaway and was nominated for nine other Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Cinematography for Ernest Laszlo, and Best Costume Design for designer Edith Head. With attention paid to the detail of day-to-day airport and airline operations, the plot concerns the response to a paralyzing snowstorm, environmental concerns over noise pollution, and an attempt to blow up an airliner. The film is characterized by personal stories intertwining while decisions are made minute-by-minute by the airport and airline staffs, operations and maintenance crews, flight crews, and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers. Ernest Laszlo photographed it in 70 mm Todd-AO. It is the last film scored by Alfred Newman and the last film roles of Van Heflin and Jessie Royce Landis. It was also Ross Hunter's last film produced for Universal after a 17-year tenure.    Plot  At Chicago's fictional Lincoln International Airport, a Trans Global Airlines (TGA) Boeing 707 flight crew misjudge their turn from Runway 29 onto the taxiway, becoming stuck in the snow and closing that runway. Airport manager Mel Bakersfeld is forced to work overtime, causing tension with his wife. A divorce seems imminent as he nurtures a closer relationship with a co-worker, customer relations agent Tanya Livingston. Pilot Vernon Demerest is scheduled to evaluate Captain Anson Harris during TGA Flight 2 to Rome. TGA's flagship international service, The Golden Argosy, is being operated with a Boeing 707. Despite being married to Bakersfeld's sister, Demerest is having an affair with Gwen Meighen, chief stewardess on the flight, who informs him before takeoff that she is pregnant with his child. They consider abortion, but Gwen has moral qualms about such a procedure and expresses the excitement she felt upon being told of her pregnancy. Bakersfeld borrows mechanic Joe Patroni to assist with moving TGA's disabled plane blocking Runway 29. Airport Manager Mel Bakersfeld and customer relations agent Tanya also deal with an elderly widow from San Diego who is a habitual stowaway on various airlines. Demolition expert D.O. Guerrero, down on his luck and with a history of mental illness, buys both a ticket aboard Flight 2 and a large life insurance policy with the intent of committing suicide. He plans to set off a bomb in an attaché case while they fly over the Atlantic Ocean so that his wife, Inez, will collect $225,000 of insurance. His erratic behavior at the airport, including mistaking a Customs officer for a gate agent, attracts officials' attention. Inez finds a Special Delivery envelope from a travel agency and, realizing D.O. might be doing something desperate, goes to the airport to try to dissuade him. She informs officials that he had been fired from a construction job for \"misplacing\" explosives and that the family's financial situation is dire. The elderly widow manages to evade the employee assigned the task of putting her on a flight back to Los Angeles. Enchanted by the idea of a trip to Rome, she talks her way past the gate agent, boards Flight 2 and sits next to Guerrero. When Flight 2's crew is made aware of Guerrero's situation, they turn the plane back toward Chicago without informing the passengers. Once the stowaway widow is discovered, her help is enlisted by the crew to get to the briefcase, but the ploy fails. The pilot Vernon Demerest tries to persuade Guerrero not to trigger the bomb, informing him that his insurance policy has been nullified. Guerrero moves to give Demerest the bomb, but Guerrero runs into the lavatory and sets off the bomb, dying and blowing a three-foot hole in the fuselage.

Daniel The Amityville Horror is a 1979 American supernatural horror film directed by Stuart Rosenberg, and starring James Brolin, Margot Kidder, and Rod Steiger. The film follows a young couple who purchase a home haunted by combative supernatural forces. It is based on Jay Anson's 1977 book of the same name, which documented the alleged paranormal experiences of the Lutz family who briefly resided in the Amityville, New York home where Ronald DeFeo Jr. committed the mass murder of his family in 1974. It is the first entry in the long-running Amityville Horror film series, and was remade in 2005. Executive producer Samuel Z. Arkoff originated the project after purchasing the right's to Anson's book, and it was initially conceived as a television film, which Anson adapted himself. When Arkoff rejected the teleplay, it was reworked by screenwriter Sandor Stern as a feature film. The producers intended to shoot the film in the actual DeFeo residence, but its owners denied them permission. Filming instead began on location in Toms River, New Jersey in October 1978, followed by interior shoots occurring at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sound stages in Los Angeles, which were completed just before the Christmas holiday. The Amityville Horror had its world premiere at the Museum of Modern Art on July 24, 1979, before receiving a wide theatrical release three days later. The film was a major commercial success and one of the most profitable films released by its distributor, American International Pictures. It went on to gross over $80 million in North America, becoming one of the highest-grossing independent films of all time, as well as one of the highest-grossing horror films in cinema history.  Though met with largely unfavorable critical reviews at the time of its release, composer Lalo Schifrin's musical score earned the film Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, while Kidder received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. Some contemporary film scholars have considered the film a classic of the horror genre, and it is widely regarded as a seminal entry in the sub-genre of the contemporary haunted house film. In his 1981 non-fiction book, Danse Macabre, horror author Stephen King interprets the film as a parable on the anxieties of homeownership and financial ruin, citing the economic crisis of the 1970s and the film's frequent references to financial matters, a reading which has been similarly assessed by other film scholars.    Plot  In the early morning hours on November 13, 1974, Ronald DeFeo Jr. murders his entire family with a rifle at their home of 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, New York. One year later, middle-class newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz move into the house with Kathy's three children from a prior marriage: Greg, Matt, and Amy. Despite George's irreligiosity, Kathy, a nominal Roman Catholic, requests Jesuit priest Father Delaney to bless the home. Delaney arrives while the family is out boating on the Long Island Sound. Upon entering the house, Delaney is swarmed by flies upstairs and hears a hostile voice ordering him to leave, causing him to flee. The next day, Kathy's aunt Helena, a nun, visits the house but becomes violently ill and leaves abruptly, confounding Kathy. The Lutzes' domestic life begins a sharp decline over the ensuing weeks: George becomes uncharacteristically volatile and abusive, and obsesses over keeping the home warm with firewood, despite Kathy's insistence that it is not cold. George recurrently awakens at 3:15 a.m.—the same time the DeFeos were murdered—while Kathy suffers disturbing nightmares. Before Kathy's brother's engagement party one night, $1,500 cash to be paid to the caterer inexplicably goes missing in the house. Meanwhile, the babysitter watching Amy for the evening is locked inside a bedroom closet by an unseen force. Further unexplained incidents occur when one of the two boys suffers a crushed hand when a sash window falls on it, and Amy has an imaginary friend, Jody, who seems to be of a malevolent nature. One night, Kathy  glimpses two red, swine-like eyes outside Amy's second-story bedroom window. Delaney makes several attempts to intervene that seem to be thwarted by unusual accidents and occurrences: His phone calls to the home are frequently experienced by Kathy as static noise, and on one occasion his car malfunctions en-route to the house, nearly causing a fatal crash. Convinced there are demonic forces at work, Delaney grows frustrated by the lack of support from his superiors in the diocese. Meanwhile, George's land surveying business begins to suffer due to his lack of attendance, concerning his business partner, Jeff. Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When did the director of film A Whirlwind Of Whiskers die?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nPeter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre. The Unknown was a 1915 film directed by J. E. Mathews released in support of\" The Sunny South or The Whirlwind of Fate\"( 1915). It is considered a lost film. Lloyd Vernon Hamilton (August 19, 1891 – January 19, 1935) was an American film comedian, best remembered for his work in the silent era.    Career   Having begun his career as an extra in theatre-productions, Hamilton first appeared on film in 1913, doing various uncredited roles in one-reel comedies. A year later, in 1914, he teamed up with comedian Bud Duncan, and for the next three years the two performers appeared as comedy team Ham and Bud in numerous one-reelers produced by the Kalem Company. Hamilton and Duncan split up in 1917, Hamilton joining Fox as a solo performer. During the next few years he developed a distinct comic persona, appearing as a slightly prissy, overgrown boy often wearing a checkered cap.  By the early 1920s, Hamilton was considered a major star of short comedies. His skills were admired by his fellow comedians, thus contributing to his reputation as a comedian's comedian; according to Oscar Levant, Charlie Chaplin singled him out as the one actor of whom he was jealous. Buster Keaton in an interview praised him as \"one of the funniest men in pictures,\" while Charley Chase, who early in his career had directed Hamilton in a number of short subjects, stated that he would often ask himself \"how would 'Ham' Hamilton play this?\" before shooting a scene. His films often have surreal touches: in The Movies he tearfully bids goodbye to his mother to go to the city, turns his back on the family farm, and steps directly into the city which is right next door. In Move Along he neatly lays his trousers in the street, to have a steamroller press them.  By 1924, Hamilton had become popular enough that it was decided he should do the transition to feature-length comedies. The five-reel comedy which resulted, His Darker Self (1924), was a flop both with critics and audiences, and Hamilton hastily returned to making two-reelers. After the failure of his first feature-length film, coupled with an increasing alcohol addiction, Hamilton is reported to have become more indifferent to his career, and his films from the later silent era are often considered more uneven in quality than his work in the early 1920s. In 1927, Hamilton was in a speakeasy when a boxer was murdered (Hamilton was not a suspect), and after the incident the motion picture authorities banned him from pictures for over a year. By 1929 he was back on screen in talking pictures (his speaking voice being a nasal tenor that fit his finicky screen character) but his continued drinking affected his health. Hamilton's last starring series was a string of two-reel comedies produced by Mack Sennett. He continued to play the hapless victim of circumstance, as in Too Many Highballs where Hamilton tries to park his car and keeps getting boxed in by motorists. When the Sennett series lapsed, there was talk of Hamilton joining the Hal Roach studio, but Roach knew of Hamilton's notorious alcohol abuse and declined to hire him. Hamilton's facial features had acquired deep lines and hollows from heavy drinking, and he no longer looked like the \"overgrown boy\" in his final films. Relatively few of Hamilton's silent films from the 1920s survive; they were produced by Educational Pictures, which suffered a laboratory fire in 1937. Those of Hamilton's films that do exist are often prized by comedy collectors and silent-film enthusiasts.    Personal life   Hamilton was married twice. He married Ethel Lloyd Hamilton in May 1913; the couple had become estranged by the early 1920s, and divorced in 1926. The year after, in June 1927, he married Irene Dalton, an actress who had appeared as his leading lady in several two-reelers. The marriage to Dalton quickly became troubled, however, and they were divorced by 1928. Hamilton had no children. During the 1920s, Hamilton became a heavy drinker, and it has long been claimed that he would often turn rather violent when intoxicated. However, in Anthony Balducci's biography of Hamilton (McFarland & Company, 2009) the author argues that there exists no specific evidence anywhere of Hamilton having been physically violent. Marin Sais (born Mae Smith; August 2, 1890 – December 31, 1971) was an American actress whose career was most prolific during the silent film era of the 1910s and 1920s. Sais' acting career spanned over four decades and she is possibly best recalled for appearing in Western themed films.    Early life and career  Born in San Rafael, California into a family that was allegedly descended from one of the earliest Spanish families to settle in California, Marin Sais began her acting career as a teenager after travelling to New York City where she appeared in vaudeville. In 1910, at the age of twenty, Sais made her screen debut for New York City's Vitagraph Studios in the short film adaptation of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night opposite the notable actors Florence Turner and Julia Swayne Gordon. Sais would go on to star in a number of well-received comedy shorts for Kalem Company opposite actors Ruth Roland, Marshall Neilan and Edward Coxen. In 1911, Sais made her first appearance in a Western titled The Ranger's Stratagem – it would become a frequent career choice for the actress and in her later career she would rarely appear in other motion picture genres. Throughout the 1910s, Sais' career as an actress continued to build momentum and the actress showed her versatility by appearing in such varied genres as comedy shorts, Westerns, dramas, and beginning in 1915 she began appearing in a James W. Horne directed Kalem Company  Nancy Drew-style mystery serial The Girl Detective, with such titles as: The Riddle of the Rings, The Secret Code, The Disappearing Necklace and The Vanishing Vases. Sais also continued to work under the direction of Horne in dozens of Western shorts.    Rise to stardom   In December 1915, Sais was filming a lead role on location in the Mojave Desert when a sudden sandstorm blew in.  She and the film crew were stranded for a day, unable to get to the nearest settlement.  She suffered seriously from exposure but recuperated after a few days of rest in Los Angeles, California. In 1916 she began appearing as the character Barbara Brent in a Horne directed Western series of shorts. By 1918 Sais was a highly popular and publicly recognizable film personality and was chosen by Japanese silent film matinee idol Sessue Hayakawa to appear opposite him in a series of film collaborations, the first being the 1918 racial drama The City of Dim Faces followed by His Birthright, released the same year and also starring Hayakawa's actress wife Tsuru Aoki. Sais' collaboration with Hayakawa ended with the 1919 film Bonds of Honor and the same year Sais appeared with Swedish actress Anna Q. Nilsson in the moderately successful drama The Vanity Pool. In 1920, Sais married silent Western actor Jack Hoxie whom she met on the set of the 1916 film Tigers Unchained. It was her second marriage. The two began appearing in a number of well-received Western action and adventure films. Although the couple would divorce seven years later, Sais would rarely appear in films outside of the Western genre from 1920 onward. One notable film of the period was the Bruce M. Mitchell directed 1924 film The Hellion, which featured  British actor Boris Karloff in one of his first prominent roles.    Later career and death  By the mid-1920s Marin Sais' career was declining and she began appearing in a number of lower-budget Westerns. It was a trend that would follow Sais throughout her career into the talkie era of the 1930s and give her the dubious title of \"Queen of the B-movie oaters\". During the 1930s, Sais appeared in approximately twenty films - nearly all Westerns. One notable exception is an uncredited role as Mrs. Harper in 1936 cult classic Reefer Madness. Sais' acting career continued throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s, often in bit parts or in uncredited roles in poorly received, low-budget Westerns. Two exceptions were the popular 1945 Sam Newfield-directed Western Lightning Raiders, starring Buster Crabbe and her role as The Duchess in the long-running 1949 Red Ryder serials starring Jim Bannon. By the early 1950s, she made a tentative foray into the new medium of television with a guest appearance on The Lone Ranger. Sais' last role before retirement was a small part in the made-for-TV movie The Great Jesse James Raid in 1953. As a star in her 20s, prior to the end of World War I, Sais' home was in Glendale, California.

He remembers little of the night and knows little about his houseguest. Valentine is attracted to Jonathan and sets out first to reform and then to marry him, explaining to her horse-breaking uncle Sam that she intends to \"slip a bit in his mouth and make him like it\". In her way is Jonathan's girlfriend, actress Carol Wallace.\nJonathan is dismayed to discover that his neglected family shipping firm is in dire trouble, and that he will not be receiving his usual check, leaving him broke. Valentine decides to use this news to ignite his ambition. She buys up controlling interest in the company and moves into his home as the new tenant. When he discovers the identity of the new owner, he wrongly assumes she went out with him solely to learn what she could about the company. Furious, he tells her that he will fight to get the company back, but later, to his valet, Butch, he admits he is beaten, as nobody will lend him the money he needs to make the attempt. Butch, who approves of Valentine, informs her of this. She makes Jonathan vice president, but he visits the office only to inform her that Carol has asked him to marry her, and that he has accepted.\nThat afternoon, Valentine tries her best to disrupt the ceremony, with the help of noisy bearded window washers, presided over by an increasingly frustrated Justice of the Peace. Finally, Sam Ransome bursts in and declares that Carol is the mother of his children. The wedding is off, but one of the guests, Mr. Meggs, recognizes Sam and informs Jonathan.\nThe next day, Jonathan outlines to the firm's receivership board his bold new plan to get the company back on its financial feet. The board members vote to accept his scheme and return control of the business to him. Valentine is pleased by his display of initiative and drive ... until he tells her that the wedding with Carol is back on. In desperation, Butch produces a forged marriage certificate showing that Valentine and Jonathan are husband and wife. Carol leaves in a huff.\nAfter Butch informs Valentine of the deception, she continues the masquerade, much to Jonathan's discomfort. When Butch confesses the truth to Jonathan, however, the tables are turned. She flees from her suddenly amorous \"husband\". However, at the train station, they make peace and get married for real.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nBarbara Stanwyck as Valentine Ransome\nHerbert Marshall as Jonathan Blair\nGlenda Farrell as Carol Wallace\nEric Blore as Butch, Blair's Valet\nDonald Meek as Justice of the Peace\nEtienne Girardot as Mr. Meggs\nFrank M.

Santell directed over 60 films, beginning in 1917, most of which were two-reel comedy short subjects for Hal Roach and other productions companies. Taking up feature films from about 1924, Santell worked for several major studios. In 1934, he was married to actress Jane N. Keithley; they remained married until her death.

The story concerns a young woman raised in an unwholesome environment who joins a confidence racket run by one of her mother's friends. She agrees to marry the victim of one of her scams, becomes a war widow, and is left to raise a baby, but abandons it each evening to go out dancing. After the child suffers an accident in her absence, she is charged with child neglect and loses custody. She mends her ways by devotedly caring for an abandoned infant and meets up again with the con man, who has also reformed after a prison stint, and together they build a new life. The film was the last work of director Santell and the last leading role for actor Dunn. In 2018 a re-mastered and restored print by Paramount Pictures, The Film Foundation, and Martin Scorsese was screened at the Museum of Modern Art as part of the museum's program of showcasing 30 restored films from the library of Republic Pictures, curated by Scorsese.    Plot  On Mother's Day 1946, a woman known as Ziggy Brennan looks back on her life. Eight years earlier, her vain and corrupt mother Natalie asks Ziggy to pretend they are sisters. Together they trick men out of money. Ziggy takes a liking to a con artist, Denny Reagan, and steals a sailor's watch that Denny admires. The watch's inscription, showing it is a gift from the boy's mother, gives Denny a guilty conscience, so Ziggy returns it to Mart Neilson, the sailor. He asks her on a date, which leads to marriage. Two days later Neilson is shipped off to war. He is killed in action while Ziggy is pregnant with their child. Ziggy is warned by Natalie after the birth of baby Martha that she is not fit for motherhood. Denny is now doing time in a penitentiary, so he is no help either. Ziggy likes to go out dancing every night, leaving Martha with an irresponsible young babysitter. While the babysitter sneaks out to be with her boyfriend, Martha tumbles out of her crib and is nearly strangled by the bedsheets. A landlady's testimony results in the baby being sent to a juvenile ward. Ziggy is given a suspended sentence for child neglect, but is forbidden from having contact with her child. Denny's mother tracks down Ziggy and encourages her to pray for salvation. By the time Denny leaves prison, he is a reformed man. He tracks down Ziggy and finds that she has taken in an abandoned infant found in a local church and is caring for it, having named him Denny. Together they appeal to the court for a second chance, then leave together with both children, united as a family.    Cast  James Dunn as Denny Reagan Mona Freeman as Ziggy Brennan William Marshall as CPO Martin J.

The script underwent several rewrites on the orders of Joseph I. Breen, director of the Production Code Administration.    Casting   The Times Colonist noted that James Dunn and June Duprez were both cast against type. Dunn, who had won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as an alcoholic father in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), here played \"a daring, but sentimental young gangster\". Duprez, typically viewed by film producers as \"an Oriental princess type\", was cast as \"a hardboiled and rowdy mother\". Mona Freeman was cast in the lead role of Ziggy after an extensive talent search. In December 1945, director Alfred Santell returned from a New York trip during which he tested dozens of actresses; he was said to be looking for \"some girl who looked like Lana Turner or Gene Tierney and could act like Sylvia Sidney\". Theodred II was a medieval Bishop of Elmham. The date of Theodred's consecration unknown, but the date of his death was sometime between 995 and 997. Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV. Thomas Scott( 1907- date of death unknown) was an English diver. John Joseph Haley Jr. (August 10, 1897 - June 6, 1979) was an American actor, comedian, dancer, radio host, singer, drummer and vaudevillian. He was best known for his portrayal of the Tin Man and his farmhand counterpart Hickory in the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Wizard of Oz.    Early life  Haley was born on August 10, 1897. His father was a waiter by trade, and later a ship's steward. He died in the wreck of the schooner Charles A. Briggs at Nahant, Massachusetts on February 1, 1898, when Jack was almost six months old. He had one older brother, William Anthony \"Bill\" Haley, a musician, who died of pneumonia in 1916 at the age of twenty-one after contracting tuberculosis.    Career   Haley headlined in vaudeville as a song-and-dance comedian. One of his closest friends was Fred Allen, who would frequently mention \"Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts\" on the air. Haley made a few phonograph records in 1923, and in the early 1930s starred in comedy shorts for Vitaphone in Brooklyn, New York. His wide-eyed, good-natured expression gained him supporting roles in musical feature films, including Poor Little Rich Girl with Shirley Temple, Higher and Higher with Frank Sinatra and the Irving Berlin musical Alexander's Ragtime Band. Both Poor Little Rich Girl and Alexander's Ragtime Band were released by Twentieth Century-Fox. Haley was under contract to them and appeared in the Fox films Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm and Pigskin Parade, marking his first appearance with Judy Garland. Haley hosted a radio show from 1937 to 1939 known to many as The Jack Haley Show. The first season (1937-1938), the show was sponsored by Log Cabin Syrup and was known as The Log Cabin Jamboree. The next season (1938-1939), the show was sponsored by Wonder Bread and was known as The Wonder Show. During the second season the show featured Gale Gordon and Lucille Ball as regular radio performers. Haley returned to musical comedies in the 1940s. Most of his '40s work was for RKO Radio Pictures. He left the studio in 1947 when he refused to appear in a remake of RKO's Seven Keys to Baldpate. Phillip Terry took the role. He subsequently went into real estate, taking guest roles in television series over the next couple of decades.     \"The Tin Man\" in The Wizard of Oz   Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer hired Haley for the part of the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz. He replaced song-and-dance comedian Buddy Ebsen, who had suffered a severe allergic reaction after inhaling aluminum powder from his silver face makeup, which triggered a congenital bronchial condition; the dust settled in Ebsen's lungs and, within a few days of principal photographic testing, he found himself struggling to breathe. For Haley, to avoid the same problem, the dust was converted into a paste—even so, the paste caused an eye infection that sidelined Haley for four shooting days. Surgical treatment averted serious or permanent damage to Haley's eyes. Haley also portrayed the Tin Man's Kansas counterpart, Hickory Twicker, one of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry's farmhands. Haley did not remember the makeup or the costume fondly. Interviewed about the film years later by Tom Snyder, he related that many fans assumed making the film was a fun experience. Haley said, \"Like hell it was. It was work!\" For his role as the Tin Woodman, Haley spoke in the same soft tone he used when reading bedtime stories to his children. Oz was one of only three films Haley made for MGM. The others were Pick a Star, a 1937 Hal Roach production distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Mr. Cinderella in 1936.    Personal life   Haley was raised Roman Catholic. He was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Who is the mother-in-law of Andrew Murray (Scottish Soldier)?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nVera Miletić (Serbian Cyrillic: Вера Милетић; 8 March 1920 – 7 September 1944) was a Serbian student and soldier. She was notable for being the mother of Mira Marković, posthumously making her the mother-in-law of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević. The flag of Scotland (Scottish Gaelic: bratach na h-Alba; Scots: Banner o Scotland, also known as St Andrew's Cross or the Saltire) is the national flag of Scotland, which consists of a white saltire defacing a blue field. The Saltire, rather than the Royal Standard of Scotland, is the correct flag for all private individuals and corporate bodies to fly. It is also, where possible, flown from Scottish Government buildings every day from 8:00 am until sunset, with certain exceptions. Use of the flag is first recorded with the illustration of a heraldic flag in Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount's Register of Scottish Arms, c. 1542. It is possible that this is based on a precedent of the late 15th century, the use of a white saltire in the canton of a blue flag reputedly made by Queen Margaret, wife of James III (1451–1488).    Design   The heraldic term for an X-shaped cross is a 'saltire', from the old French word saultoir or salteur (itself derived from the Latin saltatorium), a word for both a type of stile constructed from two cross pieces and a type of cross-shaped stirrup-cord. In heraldic language, the Scottish flag may be blazoned azure, a saltire argent. The tincture of the Saltire can appear as either silver (argent) or white. However, the term azure does not refer to a particular shade of blue. Throughout the history of fabric production natural dyes have been used to apply a form of colour, with dyes from plants, including indigo and woad, having dozens of compounds whose proportions may vary according to soil type and climate; therefore giving rise to variations in shade. In the case of the Saltire, variations in shades of blue have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue. When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century, the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly selected on the basis of the durability of darker dyes, with this dark blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land. Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour trend of the Union Flag for the Saltire itself, leading to a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland. These variations in shade eventually led to calls to standardise the colour of Scotland's national flag, and in 2003 a committee of the Scottish Parliament met to examine a petition that the Scottish Executive adopt the Pantone 300 colour as a standard (this blue is of a lighter shade than the Pantone 280 of the Union Flag). Having taken advice from a number of sources, including the office of the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the committee recommended that the optimum shade of blue for the Saltire be Pantone 300. Recent versions of the Saltire have therefore largely converged on this official recommendation (Pantone 300 is #005EB8 as a web colour).  The flag proportions are not fixed but 3:5 is most commonly used, as with other flags of the countries of the United Kingdom (flag manufacturers themselves may adopt alternative ratios, including 1:2 or 2:3). Lord Lyon King of Arms states that 4:5 is suitable. The ratio of the width of the bars of the saltire in relation to the width of the field is specified in heraldry in relation to shield width rather than flag width. However, this ratio, though not rigid, is specified as one-third to one-fifth of the width of the field.    History   The 1320 Declaration of Arbroath cites Scotland's conversion to Christianity by St. Andrew, \"the first to be an Apostle\". Depiction of the saint being crucified on a decussate cross was seen on seals in Scotland from 1180 onwards and was used on a seal of the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286. Bishop William de Lamberton (r. 1297–1328) also used the crucified figure of the saint in his seal.  The saltire (decussate cross, diagonal cross) was used as a field sign in the medieval period without any connection to Saint Andrew. The connection between the field sign and the legendary mode of crucifixion of the saint may originate in Scotland, in the late 14th century. The Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that every Scottish and French soldier (fighting against the English under Richard II) \"shall have  a sign before and behind, namely a white St. Andrew's Cross\". James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas at the Battle of Otterburn (1388) reportedly used a pennon with a saltire at the hoist. Cornelia( c. 190s – c. 115 BC) was the second daughter of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the hero of the Second Punic War, and Aemilia Paulla. She is remembered as a prototypical example of a virtuous Roman woman. She was the mother of the Gracchi brothers, and the mother- in- law of Scipio Aemilianus. Robert de Brus (July 1243 – before April 1304), 6th Lord of Annandale, jure uxoris Earl of Carrick (1252–1292), Lord of Hartness, Writtle and Hatfield Broad Oak, was a cross-border lord, and participant of the Second Barons' War, Ninth Crusade, Welsh Wars, and First War of Scottish Independence, as well as father to the future king of Scotland Robert the Bruce. Of Scoto-Norman-Irish heritage, through his father he was a third-great grandson of David I of Scotland. Other ancestors included Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, Edmund Ironside, Fergus of Galloway, Henry I of England and Aoife MacMurrough, daughter of Dermot MacMurrough.    Life  The son and heir of Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale and Lady Isabella de Clare, daughter of the Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, his birth date is generally accepted, but his place of birth is less certain. It is generally accepted that he, rather than his first son, was born on the family estate at Writtle, Essex. Legend tells that the 27-year-old Robert de Brus was a handsome young man participating in the Ninth Crusade. When Adam de Kilconquhar, one of his companions-in-arms, fell in 1270, at Acre, Robert was obliged to travel to tell the sad news to Adam's widow Marjorie of Carrick. The story continues that Marjorie was so taken with the messenger that she had him held captive until he agreed to marry her, which he did in 1271. However, since the crusade landed in Acre on 9 May 1271, and only started to engage the Muslims in late June, the story and/or his participation in the Ninth Crusade are generally discounted. What is recorded, is that in 1264 his father, the 5th Lord of Annandale, was captured, along with Henry III of England, Richard of Cornwall, and the future Edward I of England at the Battle of Lewes, Sussex. Bruce negotiated with his uncle Bernard Brus, and cousin Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, both supporters of Simon de Montfort, over the terms of the ransom. Following the Battle of Evesham, in August 1265, both Bruce and his father profited from the seizure of the rebellious barons' possessions, including those of Bernard. The younger Robert acquired lands in Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Bedfordshire. Robert and his younger brother Richard are known to have received letters of protection, in July 1270, to sail with Edward for crusade that August, and are presumed to have taken the cross, with Edward, at Northampton in 1268. They were joined by their father, who had sought pardon from Alexander III, but their date of return from Acre is less certain; it may have been as early as October 1271, when the younger Robert is recorded as receiving a quitclaim in Writtle, Essex, and his mother a gift of deer, from the King, also in Essex. In 1272 he married, without Scottish royal consent, Marjorie, Countess of Carrick. As a result, she temporarily lost her castle and estates, that Oram described as poor, but regained them on payment of a fine. Around this time his mother died; the date is unknown but on 3 May 1273 his father married Christina de Ireby, the Widow of Adam Jesmond, the Sheriff of Northumberland, at Hoddam. The marriage added estates in Cumberland and dower land from her previous husband, to the Brus holdings. The younger Robert and his step-mother do not appear to have got on, with Robert recorded as trying to withhold dower lands, after his father's death in 1295. This may be one of the reasons why the father appears to have independently managed the possessions in the North, as well as intermittently holding the position of Constable of Carlisle, while Robert appears to have confined himself largely to the management of the southern and Midland possessions, with his brother Richard who independently held Tottenham and Kempston, as well as commanding a Knight banneret for Edward. Richard is recorded as receiving a number of wards and gifts of deer and to have sought permission to empark the forest at Writtle at this time. Andrew Moray (Anglo-Norman: Andreu de Moray; Latin: Andreas de Moravia), also known as Andrew de Moray, Andrew of Moray, or Andrew Murray, an esquire. He first rose to prominence during the First Scottish War of Independence, initially raising a small band of supporters at Avoch Castle in early summer 1297 to fight King Edward I of England. He soon had successfully regained control of the north for the absent Scots king, John Balliol. Moray subsequently merged his army with that of William Wallace, and jointly led the combined army to victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge on 11 September 1297. He was severely wounded in that battle, dying at an unknown date and place that year.    Childhood  Andrew Moray the younger of Petty was born late in the second half of the 13th century. The date and place of his birth are unknown. Andrew's father Sir Andrew Moray of Petty was an influential north Scotland baron and Justiciar of Scotia (1289?–1296), and his mother was the historically-anonymous fourth daughter of John Comyn I of Badenoch. Nothing is known of the formative years of Moray the younger's life. Similarly to other members of his social class, he likely embarked in his youth on the training for knighthood. This would have entailed him being fostered in the household of a mature knight outwith his family, where he would undergo training in horsemanship and in the use of weapons, he would care for the knight's armour and weapons, and care for the knight's horses. He would also serve the knight meals at the table. He did not attain knighthood within his lifetime.    The Morays of Petty’s place in Scottish society  The Morays of Petty was a wealthy and politically influential baronial family whose power base was located in the province of Moray in north-east Scotland. The family traced their origins to Freskin of Uphall, in Lothian, who was granted lands in the Laich of Moray during the 12th-century reign of King David I of Scotland. Freskin built a motte-and-bailey castle on these lands at Duffus on the north shore of Loch Spynie (this sea-loch was almost completely drained in the 18th and 19th centuries to bring hundreds of acres of land into agricultural use).  The Morays of Petty possessed significant political influence. The family were loyal agents of the Scots king. Sir Andrew acted from 1289 as the king's chief law officer in north Scotland (the Justiciar) and may have been co-opted to the guardianship following in the premature death of King Alexander III.  Sir Andrew Moray of Petty had close personal connections to the most politically influential family in Scottish society, the  Comyns. Sir Andrew’s first wife was a daughter of John (I) 'the Red' Comyn of Badenoch, and his second wife was Euphemia Comyn. The Morays of Petty also had links to the Douglases of Douglasdale. At the outbreak of the Scottish Wars of Independence the Moray family was established in north and south Scotland. Sir Andrew Moray of Petty the head of the north branch of the family, held the lordship of Petty, which was controlled from Hallhill manor on the south bank of the Moray Firth; the lordship of Avoch in the Black Isle, controlled from Avoch Castle situated to the east of Inverness and overlooking the Moray Firth; and the lordship of Boharm in Banffshire, controlled from Gauldwell Castle. Amongst Sir Andrew's estates at Petty were lands at Alturile, Brachlie and Croy, and at Boharm were lands at Arndilly and Botriphnie. Andrew Moray the younger was heir to these lands and castles.    Sir William Moray of Bothwell, the elder brother of Andrew the younger's father, held extensive lands in Lanarkshire and at Lilleford in Lincolnshire.   Sir William, who was known as le riche due to his extensive personal wealth, was in 1296 constructing Bothwell Castle overlooking the River Clyde. Its design was influenced by the latest continental European trends in castle construction, for example Chateau de Coucy. It was clearly intended as an unequivocal statement of his influence and wealth. Moray the younger was also heir to his uncle's lands and castles.  The Morays of Petty also had a presence in the Scottish medieval church. A forebear of Moray the younger, also named Andrew, was bishop of Moray early in the thirteenth century, and an uncle, David Murray, was in the closing years of the thirteenth century a rector of Bothwell church in central Scotland and a canon of Moray.

She is the mother of Amy Irving, therefore making her the former mother- in- law of filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Bruno Barreto and the mother- in- law of documentary filmmaker Kenneth Bowser, Jr. Murray () (Irish: Ó Muirí) is both a Scottish and an Irish surname with two distinct respective etymologies. The Scottish version is a common variation of the word Moray, an anglicisation of the Medieval Gaelic word Muireb (or Moreb); the b here was pronounced as v, hence the Latinization to Moravia. These names denote the district on the south shore of the Moray Firth, in Scotland. Murray is a direct transliteration of how Scottish people pronounce the word Moray. The Murray spelling is not used for the geographical area, which is Moray, but it became the commonest form of the surname, especially among Scottish emigrants, to the extent that the surname Murray is now much more common than the original surname Moray. See also Clan Murray. In addition to the Scottish derivation, the Irish version may derive from Ó Muireadhaigh, Mac Muireadhaigh, and Mac Giolla Mhuire.    History  A considerable number of present bearers of this surname are of Scottish origin, especially in Ulster. Possible etymologies are:  From Moray in northeast Scotland, which came from the Scottish Gaelic for \"sea settlement\". As a native Irish of this name, from Mac Muireadhaigh or Ó Muireadhaigh \"descendant of Muireadhach\" or Mac Giolla Mhuire \"descendant of the servant of the Virgin Mary\". The motto for Murray is Imperio. \"Murrays\" trace their heritage back to the 12th century and take their name from the province of Moray, once a local kingdom. It was during this time that the Flemish lords crossed the North Sea and established themselves in the Scottish realm. Among them was Freskin. It is possible that either Freskin or his son William intermarried with the ancient royal house of Moray. The senior line of the Murrays took the surname of Sutherland and became Earls of Sutherland by 1235. Thereafter, the chiefs of the Murrays were the Lords of Petty in Moray, who also became Lords of Bothwell in Clydesdale before 1253. An heir of this line, Sir Andrew Moray, was the brilliant young general who led the Scots in 1297 in their first uprising against English rule. He was mortally wounded while winning his famous victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. His son, Sir Andrew Murray, 4th Lord of Bothwell, third Regent of Scotland, married Christian Bruce, a sister of King Robert the Bruce. He was captured at Roxburgh early in 1333 and was a prisoner in England at the time of the Battle of Halidon Hill. He obtained his freedom in time to march to the relief of his wife, who was defending Kildrummy Castle. Sir Andrew commenced with unabated spirit to struggle in the cause of independence and died in 1338. The last Murray Lord of Bothwell died in 1360 of the plague. By the 16th century, the Murrays of Tullibardine in Strathearn had assumed the leadership of the Murrays. This was formally confirmed by Bands of Association in 1586 and 1589. Sir John became the 1st Earl of Tullibardine in 1606. Thus, the Tullibardine hegemony was firmly established among the Murrays; and George Iain Murray, 10th Duke of Atholl was also Marquis of Tullibardine as recognized in Lyon Register as Chief of the Murrays. The 2nd Earl of Tullibardine William Murray, 1574 circa – 1628, married Lady Dorothea Stewart, heiress of the Earls of Atholl in 1629 and Marquises from 1676. To their medieval peacock's head crest (motto-Praite), they added the mermaid (motto-Tout Pret), as Lords of Balquidder; and in the seventeenth century, they took the demi-savage holding a sword and a key commemorating the capture of the last Lord of the Isles by the 1st Stewart Earl of Atholl in 1475: hence the motto Furth, Fortune, and Fill the Fetters. (Go forth against your enemies, have good fortune, and return with hostages and booty). Since 1703, the Murray's chiefs have been Dukes of Atholl. For a time in the 18th century, the Murray dukes were also Sovereign Lords of the Isle of Man, with their own coinage and parliament, The House of Keys. Sir Andrew Murray (1298–1338), also known as Sir Andrew Moray, or Sir Andrew de Moray, was a Scottish military and political leader who supported King David II of Scotland against Edward Balliol and King Edward III of England during the Second War of Scottish Independence. He held the lordships of Avoch and Petty in north Scotland, and Bothwell in west-central Scotland.  In 1326 he married Christina Bruce, a sister of King Robert I of Scotland. Murray was twice chosen as Guardian of Scotland, first in 1332, and again from 1335 on his return to Scotland after his release from captivity in England.  He held the guardianship until his death in 1338.    Childhood  Andrew Murray was born in 1298, around Pentecost. He was the son of Andrew Moray, joint-commander with William Wallace of the Scottish army at the Battle of Stirling Bridge on 11 September 1297. Murray's father was mortally wounded in that battle, dying sometime in the late 1297 before his son's birth.  The identity of Murray's mother is not known. During his campaign of 1303 while Edward I was residing in Lochindorb Castle in the Moray uplands, he dispatched men to seize the five-year-old Andrew Murray as a hostage. The child would spend the next eleven years in English captivity, only returning home to Scotland in the autumn of 1314 in the prisoner exchanges after the Battle of Bannockburn.    Family  In July 1326 at a ceremony at Cambuskenneth Abbey, Andrew Murray married Christian Bruce, also known as Christina, sister of King Robert I, widow of Sir Christopher Seton. Some argue that Insofar as his wife may have been beyond child-bearing years at around 46 years of age, therefore it has been conjectured that his two known sons were from a previous marriage or relationship. Although her exact age or date of birth is not known, she was certainly well into her 40s at the time of the marriage.  Sir John Murray (died 1351), married Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith, without issue. Sir Thomas Murray (died 1361), married Joanna, daughter to Maurice de Moravia, Earl of Strathearn, without issue.    Military and political career   Following his return from English captivity, in 1315 Andrew Murray attended the Scottish Parliament at Ayr when the succession to the throne was decided.  Murray acceded his grandfather's lordships of Avoch, Boharm and Petty, and to that of his uncle, Sir William Murray, the lordship of Bothwell in Lanarkshire. Andrew Murray appears to have been in receipt of an annuity in 1329–1330. When the treaty of Northampton was signed on 17 March 1328 at Holyrood in Edinburgh, he was among an impressive gathering of Scottish nobles present to witness the final peace between both countries. A peace which would last only 4 years. When King Robert I died in June 1329 he left his nephew Thomas Randolph, the Earl of Moray as guardian of the infant King David. But Randolph died suddenly in June 1332. A period of turmoil befell the Scots. Domhnall, Earl of Mar was next chosen as Regent in a hasty gathering of the Scottish Nobles at Perth on 2 August. He would be killed 9 days later at the Battle of Dupplin Moor. Shortly after Edward Balliol was crowned, in 1332, Murray was elected warden or regent by the Scots who adhered to the young king, David II, but he had no opportunity of attempting anything till the following year, when he attacked Balliol at Roxburgh.  While endeavouring to rescue Ralph Golding he was taken, and, refusing to be the prisoner of any one but the king of England, was carried to Durham, April 1333. No sooner was he set at liberty, in 1334, than he raised armed opposition to the English.  With Alexander de Mowbray he marched into Buchan, and besieged Henry de Beaumont in his castle of Dundarg, on the Moray Firth (August–November).  By cutting the water pipes he compelled his foe to surrender, but he permitted him to return to England.  Murray was present at the futile parliament convened at Dairsie Castle in April 1335, by the steward of Scotland and the returned Earl of Moray, the regents.  In the subsequent surrender to Edward, and in the making of the treaty of Perth (18 August 1335), Murray had no part, but chose to go into hiding with the Earl of March and William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale. Mary Bruce (c. 1282 – 1323) was the younger sister of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots. During the First War of Scottish Independence, she was captured by the English and imprisoned in a cage at Roxburgh Castle for about four years. She was the daughter of Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, and Marjorie, Countess of Carrick.\nAlong with the king's other female relatives (Christina Bruce, Marjorie Bruce, his wife Elizabeth de Burgh and supporter Isabella MacDuff), she was captured and handed over to the English by the Earl of Ross. By order of King Edward I of England, she was then held prisoner in an iron or wooden cage exposed to the public view at Roxburgh Castle. Isabella MacDuff was imprisoned in a similar cage at Berwick Castle.  She was transferred to assumably better conditions in 1310.  This was not necessarily a humane move, it has been suggested that by this stage Bruce was gaining strength, she was potentially a valuable hostage, and the English did not want her dying of exposure. There was also a high likelihood of her being rescued from Roxburgh.\nShe was eventually released in 1314, in exchange for English noblemen captured at the Battle of Bannockburn.\n\n\n== Family ==\nShe married, firstly, Sir Neil Campbell, one of her brother's loyal supporters, and had the following known issue:\n\nIain (or John)\nDougal\nDuncan (?)\nShe married, secondly, Alexander Fraser of Touchfraser and Cowie  and had the following known issue:\n\nJohn of Touchfraser\nWilliam of Cowie and Durris.\n\n\n== Media representations ==\nShe was played by Dee Hepburn in the 1996 film The Bruce.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nPeter Traquair Freedom's Sword\nCaroline Binham Robert the Bruce\nJ R Tomlin A Kingdom's Cost Andrew Murray Craven( born January 21, 1992) is an American soccer player. Marjorie Bruce or Marjorie de Brus (c. 1296 – 1316 or 1317) was the eldest daughter of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, and the only child born of his first marriage with Isabella of Mar. Marjorie's marriage to Walter, High Steward of Scotland, gave rise to the House of Stewart. Her son was the first Stewart monarch, King Robert II of Scotland.    Early life  Her mother, Isabella, was a noblewoman from the Clan Mar. Marjorie was named after her father's mother, Marjorie, Countess of Carrick. Soon after giving birth to Marjorie, at the age of 19, Isabella died. Marjorie's father was at that time the Earl of Carrick. According to legend, Marjorie's parents had been very much in love, and Robert the Bruce did not remarry until 1302 (six years after his first wife's death), to a courtier named Elizabeth de Burgh. On 27 March 1306, her father was crowned King of Scots at Scone, Perthshire.    Imprisonment  Three months after the coronation, in June, 1306, her father was defeated at the Battle of Methven. He sent his wife, two sisters, and Marjorie north with his supporter Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, but by the end of June they were captured by Uilleam II, Earl of Ross, a Balliol supporter, who handed them over to the English. As punishment, Edward I of England sent his hostages to different places in England. Marjorie was sent to the convent at Watton. Her aunt, Christina Bruce, was sent to another convent. Elizabeth de Burgh was placed under house arrest at a manor house in Yorkshire. Elizabeth de Burgh's punishment was lighter than the others. This is due to the fact that Edward I needed the support of her father, the powerful Earl of Ulster. Marjorie's aunt, Mary Bruce, and the Countess of Buchan were imprisoned in wooden cages, exposed to public view, at Roxburgh Castle and Berwick Castle, respectively. For the next four years, Elizabeth, Christina, Mary, and Isabella endured solitary confinement. The latter two experienced daily public humiliation. A cage was built for Marjorie, who was around the age of 12, at the Tower of London, but Edward I reconsidered. He instead sent her to the Gilbertine convent in Watton. Christopher Seton, Christina's husband, was executed. Edward I died on 7 July 1307. He was succeeded by his son, Edward II, who subsequently held Marjorie captive in a convent for about seven more years. She was freed in October 1314, in exchange for Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford captured after the Battle of Bannockburn.    Marriage and death   Upon the liberation of Elizabeth de Burgh and Marjorie from their long captivity in England, Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland, was sent to receive them at the Anglo-Scottish border and conduct them back to the Scottish court. He later married Marjorie. Her dowry included the Barony of Bathgate in West Lothian. The traditional story is that two years later, on 2 March 1316, Marjorie was riding in Gallowhill, Paisley, Renfrewshire while heavily pregnant. Her horse was suddenly startled and threw her to the ground.  She went into premature labour and her child, Robert II of Scotland, was born. Marjorie died soon afterward at the age of around 20, like her mother, who was roughly the same age when she died in childbirth.  However, it is not clear that this traditional story is correct; some accounts indicate that she may have survived into 1317. She may still have died in a riding accident, but this could have taken place after the birth of her son. In fact, one source states that she died in October 1317, after falling from a horse, during a second pregnancy. Following the same October 1317 tradition, the Renfrewshire historian Crawford recorded circa 1710 that local tradition reported she was \"riding betwixt Pasly and the Castle of Renfrew, then the principal Residence of the Great Stewart of Scotland, her Husband, she was thrown from her Horse, and by the fall suffered a Dislocation of the Vertebrae of her Neck; she, being pregnant, fell in Labour (of King Robert II.) the child or Faetus, as they report, was a Cesar[ian]: The Operation being by an unskilful Hand, his Eye was touch'd by the Instrument, which afterwards proved incurable, from which he was called King Bleareie [ie. Sir Andrew Murray (1298–1338), also known as Sir Andrew Moray, or Sir Andrew de Moray, was a Scottish military and political leader who supported David II of Scotland against Edward Balliol and King Edward III of England during the so-called Second War of Scottish Independence. He held the lordships of Avoch and Petty in north Scotland, and Bothwell in west-central Scotland. In 1326 he married Christina Bruce, a sister of King Robert I of Scotland. Murray was twice chosen as Guardian of Scotland, first in 1332, and again from 1335 on his return to Scotland after his release from captivity in England. He held the guardianship until his death in 1338.  Sir Andrew Agnew, 3rd Baronet( died 1702) was the son of Sir Andrew Agnew, 2nd Baronet and Lady Anne Stewart. Eldon Howard was a British screenwriter. She was the mother- in- law of Edward J. Danziger and wrote a number of the screenplays for films by his company Danziger Productions. Christina Bruce (c. 1278 – 1356/1357), also known as Christina de Brus, was a daughter of Marjorie, Countess of Carrick, and her husband, Robert de Brus, \"jure uxoris\" Earl of Carrick, as well as a sister of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots. It is presumed that she and her siblings were born at Turnberry Castle in Carrick. == Life ==\nAfter his army's defeat at the Battle of Methven on 19 June 1306, Robert Bruce headed west to the mountains. He sent his second wife, Elizabeth, his daughter Marjorie, his sisters Christian (also known as Christina) and Mary Bruce, as well as Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan to Kildrummy Castle in the north, with his brother Nigel (known as Neil) in an attempt to protect them.\nWhen Kildrummy was besieged, the women were forced to flee. After Kildrummy Castle was betrayed and captured, Neil de Bruce was taken to Berwick to be hanged, drawn, and beheaded.\nThe women escorted by John of Strathbogie, 9th Earl of Atholl made it as far as the sanctuary of St. Duthac at Tain in Easter Ross. There, they were captured by a Balliol supporter, Earl William of Ross, who handed them over to Edward I's men. Strathbogie for daring to aid them was executed, his body burned and his head affixed on London Bridge.\nChristian was sent into solitary confinement at a Gilbertine nunnery at Sixhills in Lincolnshire,  while her sister Mary and Bruce's supporter Isabella MacDuff were imprisoned in cages. Her sister-in-law Elizabeth de Burgh was imprisoned at various locations and her niece Marjorie, only 10 years old, was imprisoned at Watton Abbey.\nChristian spent eight years as an English prisoner, and returned to Scotland in October 1314 as part of the ransom for the Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, who was taken prisoner after the Battle of Bannockburn.\nIn 1335, during the Second War of Scottish Independence, Christina commanded the garrison of Kildrummy Castle and successfully held out against pro-Balliol forces led by David of Strathbogie, prior to their defeat by her husband, Sir Andrew Murray, at the Battle of Culblean.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\nChristian's first marriage was prior to her capture, in 1301 she married Sir Christopher Seton, who was born in 1278. The marriage ended in 1306 when he was hanged, drawn and quartered by the English.  In July 1326, at Cambuskenneth Abbey, when the Papal dispensation for their marriage is dated, Christian was married for a second time to Sir Andrew Murray, the posthumous child (b. 1298) of Andrew Moray, joint leader with William Wallace of the victorious Scots army at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Sir Andrew died in 1338. Sir Andrew Murray had 2 sons: Sir John Murray (d.1351), and Sir Thomas Murray (d.1361) and some commentators argue that Christian may have been their step-mother due to her estimated age at their birth.\nChristian is sometimes reported in error to have also married Gartnait, son of Donald, Earl of Mar (died 1305). She is never described as a Countess of Mar, however, or even described as \"of Mar\". Moreover, there is no evidence of any familial relationship with Gartnait's son and successor, Donald II. A marriage to Gartnait would have been in direct conflict with her marriage to Seton, who she is known to have married in 1301 and which ended in 1306, well after the death of Gartnait in 1305. Robert I (11 July 1274 – 7 June 1329), popularly known as Robert the Bruce (Scottish Gaelic: Raibeart am Brusach), was King of Scots from 1306 to his death in 1329. Robert led Scotland during the First War of Scottish Independence against England. He fought successfully during his reign to restore Scotland to an independent kingdom and is regarded in Scotland as a national hero. Robert was a fourth-great-grandson of King David I, and his grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the \"Great Cause\". As Earl of Carrick, Robert the Bruce supported his family's claim to the Scottish throne and took part in William Wallace's revolt against Edward I of England. Appointed in 1298 as a Guardian of Scotland alongside his chief rival for the throne, John Comyn of Badenoch, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St Andrews, Robert resigned in 1300 because of his quarrels with Comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of John Balliol to the Scottish throne. After submitting to Edward I in 1302 and returning to \"the king's peace\", Robert inherited his family's claim to the Scottish throne upon his father's death. Bruce's involvement in John Comyn's murder in February 1306 led to his excommunication by Pope Clement V (although he received absolution from Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow). Bruce moved quickly to seize the throne, and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306. Edward I's forces defeated Robert in the Battle of Methven, forcing him to flee into hiding, before re-emerging in 1307 to defeat an English army at Loudoun Hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the English. Robert I defeated his other opponents, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands, and in 1309 held his first parliament. A series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland, and at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Robert defeated a much larger English army under Edward II of England, confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish kingdom. The battle marked a significant turning point, with Robert's armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout northern England, while he also expanded the war against England by sending armies to invade Ireland, and appealed to the Irish to rise against Edward II's rule. Despite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at Berwick in 1318, Edward II refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of Scotland. In 1320, the Scottish nobility submitted the Declaration of Arbroath to Pope John XXII, declaring Robert as their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland's status as an independent kingdom. In 1324, the Pope recognised Robert I as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326, the Franco-Scottish alliance was renewed in the Treaty of Corbeil. In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, Edward III, and peace was concluded between Scotland and England with the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton in 1328, by which Edward III renounced all claims to sovereignty over Scotland. Robert I died in June 1329 and was succeeded by his son, David II. Robert's body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey, while his heart was interred in Melrose Abbey, and his internal organs embalmed and placed in St Serf's Church, Dumbarton.    Early life (1274–1292)     Birth   Robert the Bruce was born on 11 July 1274. His place of birth is not known for certain, although it most likely was Turnberry Castle in Ayrshire, the head of his mother's earldom, despite claims that he may have been born in Lochmaben in Dumfriesshire, or Writtle in Essex. Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale, the first of the Bruce (de Brus) line, had settled in Scotland during the reign of King David I, and was granted the Lordship of Annandale in 1124. The future king was one of ten children, and the eldest son, of Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, and Marjorie, Countess of Carrick. From his mother, he inherited the Earldom of Carrick, and through his father, the Lordship of Annandale and a royal lineage as a fourth great-grandson of David I that would give him a claim to the Scottish throne. Maria Thins( c. 1593 – 27 December 1680) was the mother- in- law of Johannes Vermeer and a member of the Gouda Thins family.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Considered as one of the greatest and most successful actors in the history of Indian cinema, he is known as the first Superstar of Indian cinema. His accolades include five Filmfare Awards, and in 2013, he was posthumously awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour. Khanna made his debut in 1966 Aakhri Khat which was India's first official Academy Awards entry in 1967. In 2005, he was honoured with the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award on the 50th anniversary of the Filmfare Awards. He was a Member of Parliament in the 10th Lok Sabha from New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency between 1992 and 1996, elected in the 1992 New Delhi by-election as an Indian National Congress candidate. He was married to Dimple Kapadia in March 1973, eight months before her debut film Bobby was released and had two daughters from the marriage. Their elder daughter Twinkle Khanna is an actress who is married to actor Akshay Kumar, while they also have a younger daughter Rinke Khanna. Khanna died on 18 July 2012, after a period of illness. He has been honoured with a stamp and statue in his likeness, and a road renamed after him by the Prime Minister of India.    Early life and background   Rajesh Khanna was born on 29 December 1942, in Amritsar in the Punjab Province of British India, as 'Jatin Khanna' into a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family. He was adopted and raised by Chunnilal Khanna and Leelawati Khanna, who were relatives of his biological parents. His father had migrated from West Punjab to Gali Tiwarian in Amritsar. His biological parents were Lala Hiranand Khanna and Chandrani Khanna. Lala worked as headmaster of the MC High School in Burewala (in present-day Vehari District, Punjab, Pakistan). His adoptive parents belonged to a family of railway contractors who had moved from Lahore to Bombay in 1935. Khanna lived in Saraswati Niwas, in Thakur-dwar near Girgaon, Mumbai. He attended St. Sebastian's Goan High School with his friend Ravi Kapoor, who later took the stage name Jeetendra. Khanna gradually started taking an interest in theatre, did many stage and theatre plays in his school and college days, and won many prizes in inter-college drama competitions.

The oath pledged personal loyalty to Adolf Hitler in place of loyalty to the constitution of the country. Historians view the personal oath of the Third Reich as an important psychological element to obey orders for committing war crimes, atrocities, and genocide. During the Nuremberg trials, many German officers unsuccessfully attempted to use the oath as a defence against charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.    Background  During the Weimar era, the oath of allegiance, sworn by the Reichswehr, required soldiers to swear loyalty to the Reich Constitution and its lawful institutions. Following Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in 1933, the military oath changed, the troops now swearing loyalty to people and country. On the day of the death of German President Paul von Hindenburg, the oath was changed again, as part of the Nazification of the country; it was no longer one of allegiance to the Constitution or its institutions, but one of binding loyalty to Hitler himself.  Although the popular view is that Hitler drafted the oath himself and imposed it on the military, the oath was the initiative of Reich War Minister General Werner von Blomberg and General Walter von Reichenau, the chief of the Ministerial Office. The intention of Blomberg and Reichenau in having the military swear an oath to Hitler was to create a personal special bond between him and the military, which was intended to tie Hitler more tightly towards the military and away from the NSDAP. Years later, Blomberg admitted that he did not think through the full implications of the oath at the time. On 20 August 1934, the cabinet decreed the \"Law On The Allegiance of Civil Servants and Soldiers of the Armed Forces\", which superseded the original oaths. The new law decreed that both members of the armed forces and civil servants had to swear an oath of loyalty to Hitler personally.    History     Previous oaths     Reichswehr oath  From 1919 until 1935, the Weimar Republic's armed forces were called the Reichswehr (Realm Defence). The original oath called the Reichswehreid came into effect on 14 August 1919, shortly after Reichspräsident Friedrich Ebert had signed the Weimar Constitution for the German Reich. The Treaty of Versailles limited the Reichswehr to a total of 100,000 men. From 1919 to December 1933: Ich schwöre Treue der Reichsverfassung und gelobe,daß ich als tapferer Soldat das Deutsche Reich und seine gesetzmäßigen Einrichtungen jederzeit schützen,dem Reichspräsidenten und meinen Vorgesetzten Gehorsam leisten will. \"I swear loyalty to the Reich's constitution and pledge,that I as a courageous soldier always want to protect the German Reich and its legal institutions,(and) be obedient to the Reich President and to my superiors.\" In January 1933, when Adolf Hitler was appointed Reichskanzler and the Enabling Act and Gleichschaltung came into effect, the military oath changed again. From 2 December 1933 to 2 August 1934: Ich schwöre bei Gott diesen heiligen Eid,daß ich meinem Volk und Vaterland allzeit treu und redlich dienenund als tapferer und gehorsamer Soldat bereit sein will,jederzeit für diesen Eid mein Leben einzusetzen. \"I swear by God this holy oath,that I want to ever loyally and sincerely serve my people and fatherlandand be prepared as a brave and obedient soldierto risk my life for this oath at any time.\" After the death of German President Paul von Hindenburg on 2 August 1934, Hitler merged the offices of Reichspräsident and Reichskanzler, and declared himself Führer and Reichskanzler. Blomberg issued a new wording which became known as the Führereid (Hitler oath). Oscar C. Apfel( January 17, 1878 – March 21, 1938) was an American film actor, director, screenwriter and producer. He appeared in 167 films between 1913 and 1939, and also directed 94 films between 1911 and 1927. == Biography ==\nApfel was born in Cleveland, Ohio. After a number of years in commerce, he decided to adopt the stage as a profession. He secured his first professional engagement in 1900, in his hometown. He rose rapidly and soon held a position as director and producer, and was at the time noted as being the youngest stage director in America. He spent 11 years on the stage on Broadway, then joined the Edison Manufacturing Company. Apfel first directed for Thomas A. Edison, Inc. in 1911–12, where he made the innovative short film The Passer-By (1912). He also did some experimental work at Edison's laboratory in Orange, on the Edison Talking Pictures devices.\n\n\n=== Lasky ===\nWhen Apfel left the Edison company, he joined Reliance-Majestic Studios, remaining with them 18 months. In 1913, he became one of two main directors for the Jesse Laskyn Feature Play Company, the other being Cecil B. DeMille. All the first Lasky pictures were produced under his direction. Among these were the notable successes The Squaw Man (1914), Brewster's Millions, The Master Mind, The Only Son, The Ghost Breaker, The Man on the Box, The Circus Man, and Cameo Kirby.\nApfel's directorial collaboration with DeMille was a crucial element in the development of DeMille's filmmaking technique.\n\n\n=== Fox ===\nIn late 1914, Apfel left the Lasky Company and directed for various companies into the 1920s. His first move was to the producing staff of the William Fox Corporation, where he directed a series of pictures in which William Farnum starred. Some of these were A Soldier's Oath, Fighting Blood, The End of the Trail, The Battle of Hearts, and A Man of Sorrow.\n\n\n=== Paralta ===\nFor the Paralta Company, where Apfel went after leaving the Fox Corporation, he produced Peter Kyne's A Man's a Man and The Turn of a Card in which J. Warren Kerrigan starred.\n\n\n=== Armenian relief ===\nRavished Armenia (1919) (also known as Auction of Souls), a public-awareness picture for the Armenian Relief Committee, was Apfel's work. This production commanded wide attention and attracted great crowds at the special showings, which took place at the Plaza and other prominent hotels. The sympathetic interest evoked by its revelations helped in materially adding to the large sums that were subscribed to this cause.\nA series of pictures for the World Film Corporation, starring Kitty Gordon, Montague Love, June Elvidge, Louise Huff, and Evelyn Greeley, was also among Apfel's successful productions.\n\n\n=== Final years ===\nAfter many years as a director, he gradually returned to acting.

The Soldier's Creed is a standard by which all United States Army personnel are expected to live. All U.S. Army enlisted personnel are taught the Soldier's Creed during basic training, and recite the creed in public ceremonies at the conclusion of training. Both the Soldier's Creed and the Noncommissioned Officer's Creed are required knowledge at enlisted promotion boards to compete for the rank of sergeant and above, as well as 'Soldier of the Month' boards. It is also common practice to recite the Soldier's Creed at the graduation ceremony from Army ROTC. Unlike the U.S. Uniformed Services Oath of Office or the Oath of Enlistment, the Soldier's Creed is not a legally-binding oath and can be affirmed by both commissioned officers and enlisted soldiers.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe current version of the Soldier's Creed is a product of the 'Warrior Ethos' program authorized by the then Army Chief of Staff Eric K. Shinseki in May 2003. It was written by members of Task Force Soldier's Warrior Ethos Team, and was first approved in its current format by the next Army Chief of Staff Peter Schoomaker on 13 November 2003. The introduction of the Soldier's Creed kicked off a campaign known as 'Task Force Soldier'. This is a leadership commitment to soldiers ensuring they are prepared for combat and embody the Warrior Ethos contained in the Soldier's Creed. It seems to have been discussed in Congress in a 'Hearing on Army Issues' held by Senator John W. Warner on or about 19 November 2003.

His best known film is It Happened One Night (1934).\n\n\n== Early years ==\nBorn in Cincinnati to Walter Joseph Connolly and Ella Burke, Connolly attended St. Xavier College and the Cincinnati College of Music, and acted locally in amateur theatrical productions. Several years later, following his service with the U. S. Marines in World War I, rather than return directly to the U.S., Connolly elected to visit Ireland, where he enrolled in a number of non-theatre-related courses at the University of Dublin, reportedly with the intention of abandoning the profession altogether. However, numerous visits to the Abbey Theater evidently rekindled Connolly's acting bug, and within four months of his return to the States, Connolly was being praised for his work alongside Margaret Anglin and others in Paul Kester's adaptation of Henry Kistemaeckers' play, The Woman of Bronze.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBetween the years of 1916 and 1935, Connolly was a successful stage actor who appeared in twenty-two Broadway productions, notably revivals of Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author and Chekhov's Uncle Vanya. His first film appearances came in two silent films, The Marked Woman (1914) and A Soldier's Oath (1915), and his first talkie film came in 1930, Many Happy Returns, but his Hollywood film career really began in 1932, when he appeared in four films.  His trademark role was that of the exasperated business tycoon or newspaperman, often as the father of the female lead character, as in It Happened One Night (1934) with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert; Broadway Bill (1934), supporting Warner Baxter and Myrna Loy; and Libeled Lady  (1936) with William Powell and Loy again. Other notable roles included the worthless uncle of Paul Muni's character in The Good Earth (1937) and one of the two con men encountered by Mickey Rooney's Huckleberry Finn in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1939). Connolly played General Yen's American advisor in The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933).\nConnolly mostly played supporting roles, but starred occasionally, as Nero Wolfe in The League of Frightened Men (1937), in RKO's 5th Ave Girl (1939), opposite Ginger Rogers, and as the title character in The Great Victor Herbert (1939), his last film.\nOn radio, Connolly starred as the title character in The Adventures of Charlie Chan on NBC Radio from 1932 to 1938.\n\n\n== Death ==\nConnolly died on May 28, 1940 in Beverly Hills, following a stroke, and was buried in St. Joseph New Cemetery in Cincinnati.\n\n\n== Complete filmography ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWalter Connolly at the Internet Broadway Database \nWalter Connolly at IMDb\nWalter Connolly at AllMovie\nWalter Connolly at the TCM Movie Database\nWalter Connolly at Find a Grave\nLiterature on Walter Connolly The Indonesian National Armed Forces (Indonesian: Tentara Nasional Indonesia, lit. 'Indonesian National Military'; abbreviated as TNI) are the military forces of the Republic of Indonesia. It consists of the Army (TNI-AD), Navy (TNI-AL), and Air Force (TNI-AU). The President of Indonesia is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. As of 2023, it comprises approximately 400,000 military personnel including the Indonesian Marine Corps (Korps Marinir RI), which is a branch of the Navy. Initially formed with the name of the People's Security Army (TKR), then later changed to the Republic of Indonesia Army (TRI) before changing again its name to the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) to the present. The Indonesian Armed Forces were formed during the Indonesian National Revolution, when it undertook a guerrilla war along with informal militia. As a result of this, and the need to maintain internal security, the Armed forces including the Army, Navy, and Air Force has been organised along territorial lines, aimed at defeating internal enemies of the state and potential external invaders. Under the 1945 Constitution, all citizens are legally entitled and obliged to defend the nation. Conscription is provided for by law, however the Forces have been able to maintain mandated strength levels without resorting to a draft. The Indonesian armed forces (military) personnel does not include members of law enforcement and paramilitary personnel such as the Indonesian National Police (Polri) consisting of approximately 440,000+ personnel, Mobile Brigade Corps (Brimob) of around 42,000+ armed personnel, and the Indonesian College Students' Regiment or Resimen Mahasiswa (Menwa) which is a collegiate military service consisting 26,000 trained personnel.    History   Before the formation of the Indonesian Republic, the military authority in the Dutch East Indies was held by the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL) and naval forces of the Royal Netherlands Navy (KM). Although both the KNIL and KM were not directly responsible for the formation of the future Indonesian armed forces, and mainly took the role of foe during Indonesian National Revolution in 1945 to 1949, the KNIL had also provided military training and infrastructure for some of the future TNI officers and other ranks. There were military training centers, military schools and academies in the Dutch East Indies. Next to Dutch volunteers and European mercenaries, the KNIL also recruited indigenous, especially Ambonese, Kai Islanders, Timorese, and Minahasan people. In 1940, with the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Dutch East Indies oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese. Some of the indigenous soldiers that had enjoyed Dutch KNIL military academy education would later become important TNI officers, for example Suharto and Abdul Haris Nasution.  Indonesian nationalism and militarism started to gain momentum and support in World War II during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. To gain support from the Indonesian people in their war against the Western Allied force, Japan started to encourage and back Indonesian nationalistic movements by providing Indonesian youth with military training and weapons. On 3 October 1943, the Japanese military formed the Indonesian volunteer army called PETA (Pembela Tanah Air; Defenders of the Homeland). The Japanese intended PETA to assist their forces oppose a possible invasion by the Allies. The Japanese military training for Indonesian youth originally was meant to rally the local's support for the Japanese Empire, but later it became the significant resource for the Republic of Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution from 1945 to 1949. Many of these men who served in PETA, both officers and NCOs alike like Sudirman, formed the majority of the personnel that would compose the future armed forces.  The Indonesian Armed Forces started out as the People's Security Agency (Badan Keamanan Rakyat, BKR), which was formed in the third PPKI meeting, on 29 August 1945. BKR united militias across the newly independent country to maintain civil order; it was more of a constabulary than an army. The decision to create a \"security agency\", and not an army, was taken to avoid the Allied forces seeing it as an armed revolution and invading in full force. Cecil Blount DeMille (; August 12, 1881 – January 21, 1959) was an American filmmaker and actor. Between 1914 and 1958, he made 70 features, both silent and sound films. He is acknowledged as a founding father of American cinema and the most commercially successful producer-director in film history. His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship. His silent films included social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants. He was an active Freemason and member of Prince of Orange Lodge #16 in New York City. DeMille was born in Ashfield, Massachusetts, and grew up in New York City. He began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later moved to writing and directing stage productions, some with Jesse Lasky, who was then a vaudeville producer. DeMille's first film, The Squaw Man (1914), was also the first full-length feature film shot in Hollywood. Its interracial love story made it commercially successful, and it first publicized Hollywood as the home of the U.S. film industry. The continued success of his productions led to the founding of Paramount Pictures with Lasky and Adolph Zukor. His first biblical epic, The Ten Commandments (1923), was both a critical and commercial success; it held the Paramount revenue record for twenty-five years. DeMille directed The King of Kings (1927), a biography of Jesus, which gained approval for its sensitivity and reached more than 800 million viewers. The Sign of the Cross (1932) is said to be the first sound film to integrate all aspects of cinematic technique. Cleopatra (1934) was his first film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. After more than thirty years in film production, DeMille reached a pinnacle in his career with Samson and Delilah (1949), a biblical epic that became the highest-grossing film of 1950. Along with biblical and historical narratives, he also directed films oriented toward \"neo-naturalism\", which tried to portray the laws of man fighting the forces of nature. He received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director for his circus drama The Greatest Show on Earth (1952), which won both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama. His last and best-known film, The Ten Commandments (1956), also a Best Picture Academy Award nominee, is currently the eighth-highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation. In addition to his Best Picture Awards, he received an Academy Honorary Award for his film contributions, the Palme d'Or (posthumously) for Union Pacific (1939), a DGA Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. He was the first recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, which was named in his honor. DeMille's reputation had a renaissance in the 2010s, and his work has influenced numerous other films and directors.    Biography     1881–1899: early years   Cecil Blount DeMille was born on August 12, 1881, in a boarding house on Main Street in Ashfield, Massachusetts, where his parents had been vacationing for the summer. On September 1, 1881, the family returned with the newborn DeMille to their flat in New York. DeMille was named after his grandmothers Cecelia Wolff and Margarete Blount. He was the second of three children of Henry Churchill de Mille (September 4, 1853 – February 10, 1893) and his wife, Matilda Beatrice deMille (née Samuel; January 30, 1853 – October 8, 1923), known as Beatrice. His brother, William C. deMille, was born on July 25, 1878. Henry de Mille, whose ancestors were of English and Dutch-Belgian descent, was a North Carolina-born dramatist, actor, and lay reader in the Episcopal Church. DeMille's father was also an English teacher at Columbia College (now Columbia University). He worked as a playwright, administrator, and faculty member during the early years of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, established in New York City in 1884.  Henry deMille frequently collaborated with David Belasco in playwriting; their best-known collaborations included \"The Wife\", \"Lord Chumley\", \"The Charity Ball\", and \"Men and Women\". Cecil B. DeMille's mother, Beatrice, a literary agent and scriptwriter, was the daughter of German Jews. Rajesh Verma( born 6 November 1960) is an Indian politician and a member of the Bhartiya Janta Party. He was elected to the 13th Lok Sabha in 1999, the 14th Lok Sabha in 2004, the 16th Lok Sabha in 2014 and the 17th Lok Sabha in 2019 from Sitapur constituency in Uttar Pradesh state.

The Squaw Man (known as The White Man in the United Kingdom) is a 1914 American silent Western film directed by Cecil B. DeMille and Oscar C. Apfel, and starring Dustin Farnum. It was DeMille's directorial debut and one of the first feature films to be shot in what is now Hollywood.    Plot   James Wynnegate (Dustin Farnum) and his cousin, Henry (Monroe Salisbury), are upper class Englishmen and trustees for an orphans' fund. Henry loses money in a bet at a derby and embezzles money from \"the fund\" to pay off his debts. When war office officials are informed of the money missing they pursue James, but he successfully escapes to Wyoming. There, James rescues Nat-U-Ritch (Lillian St. Cyr), daughter to the chief of the Ute tribe, from local outlaw Cash Hawkins (William Elmer). Hawkins plans to exact his revenge on James, but has his plans thwarted by Nat-U-Ritch, who shoots him dead. Later, James has an accident in the mountains and needs to be rescued. Nat-U-Ritch discovers him and carries him back to safety. As she nurses him back to health, they fall in love and later have a child. Meanwhile, during an exploration of the Alps, Henry falls off a cliff. Before he succumbs to his injuries, Henry signs a letter of confession proclaiming James's innocence in the embezzlement. Before Henry's widow, Lady Diana (Winifred Kingston) and others arrive in Wyoming to tell James about the news, the Sheriff recovers the murder weapon that was used against Cash Hawkins in James and Nat-U-Ritch's home. Realizing that their son is not safe, the couple sends him away, leaving them both distraught. Facing the possibilities of losing both her son and her freedom, Nat-U-Ritch decides to take her own life instead. The movie ends with both the chief of the Ute tribe and James embracing her body.    Cast     Production background   The only onscreen filmmaking credit is \"Picturized by Cecil B. DeMille and Oscar C. Apfel.\" The film was adapted by DeMille and Apfel from the 1905 stage play of the same name by Edwin Milton Royle, and produced by DeMille, Apfel, and Jesse L. Lasky for the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, its first film. This first screen version of the story was the legendary DeMille's first movie assignment. It was also the first feature-length film shot in California, partly in what became Hollywood. Film historians agree that shorts had previously been filmed in Hollywood, with D. W. Griffith's In Old California (1910) considered the earliest. DeMille rented what is now known as the Lasky-DeMille Barn at the southeast corner of Selma and Vine Streets to serve as their studio and production office; today it is home to the Hollywood Heritage Museum. Shooting on The Squaw Man began December 29, 1913, and finished January 20, 1914. DeMille wanted to emphasize the outdoors and wanted to shoot the movie in exotic scenery and great vistas. Initially he traveled to Flagstaff, Arizona to film the movie. After seeing the vast amount of mountains near Flagstaff, the production was moved to Los Angeles. Harbor scenes were shot in San Pedro, California and the western saloon set was built beside railroad tracks in the San Fernando Valley. Footage of cattle on the open range was shot at Keen Camp near Idyllwild, California, while snow scenes were shot at Mount Palomar. Cecil B. DeMille felt that lighting in a movie was extremely important and viewed it as the visual and emotional foundation to build his image. He believed that lighting was to a film as \"music is to an opera\". The Squaw Man went on to become the only movie successfully filmed three times by the same director/producer, DeMille. He filmed a silent remake in 1918, and a talkie version in 1931. The Squaw Man was 74 minutes long and generated $244,700 in profit.    Characters  The main character James Wynnegate played by Dustin Farnum, was cast as the hero for the film.  Farnum was a notable Broadway star and his wife in real life Winifred Kingston was also a well-known actress. She played the English love interest. Red Wing (real name Lillian St. Cyr) was born into the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska on the Winnebago Reservation, and she played the American Indian wife.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Does Ted Swinford have the same nationality as Nirmala Sheoran?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nSir Matthew Clive Pinsent,  (; born 10 October 1970) is an English rower and broadcaster. During his rowing career, he won 10 world championship gold medals and four consecutive Olympic gold medals. Since retiring, he has worked as a sports broadcaster for the BBC.    Early life and family  Pinsent was born on 10 October 1970 in Holt, Norfolk. His father was the Rev. Ewen Macpherson Pinsent (1930–2020), curate of St Andrew's parish church, Kelso, Scottish Borders, and his mother, Jean Grizel, came from a distinguished military family. Through his own aristocratic and military family, Pinsent is directly descended from King Edward I and William the Conqueror.    Rowing     Student rower  Matthew Pinsent attended Aysgarth School in North Yorkshire before he began rowing at Eton College. He began his international career at the World Rowing Junior Championships in 1987. He raced again in 1988, winning the junior coxless pairs with Tim Foster. After finishing school, Pinsent read geography at St Catherine's College, Oxford. While a student, he competed in three Boat Races, winning in 1990 and 1991 but was unsuccessful in 1993 (when he was Boat Club President), having taken a year out in 1992 in order to concentrate on preparing for the Barcelona Olympics.    International career  In 1990, while still at Oxford, he joined Steve Redgrave in the coxless pair at the World Rowing Championships, winning bronze. This was the beginning of a long partnership, and the pair won at the World Championships in 1991, and at the Olympic Games in 1992 and 1996. In 2000 he won Olympic gold again as part of a coxless four with Redgrave, James Cracknell and Tim Foster. He also carried the flag for Team GB at the opening ceremony. In August 2000, the month prior to winning gold in Sydney, he took part in a three-part BBC documentary entitled Gold Fever. This followed the coxless four team in the years leading up to the Olympics, including video diaries recording the highs and lows in the quest for what would be Pinsent's third consecutive gold. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in November 2000 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel during a party celebrating the achievements of the British Olympic Association at the London Aquarium. Pinsent and Cracknell then formed a men's coxless pair and won the coxless and coxed pairs (with Neil Chugani coxing) in the 2001 World Championships, and the coxless pair in 2002. However, after a disappointing 2003 season that saw Pinsent's first World Championships defeat since 1990, he and Cracknell moved to the men's coxless four for 2004. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Pinsent's fourth Olympic Games, Pinsent stroked the boat, with Cracknell, Ed Coode and Steve Williams. In a close race with world champions Canada, they again won gold. Pinsent was elected to the International Olympic Committee's Athletes' Commission in 2001, replacing Jan Železný. In 2004, at the Athens Olympics, Pinsent failed to secure re-election to the post, being replaced by Železný. The 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m), 17 stone (110 kg) Pinsent had at one time the largest lung capacity recorded for a sportsman at 8.5 litres.

For all international matches a fourth umpire is required to perform duties like bringing on the new ball, carrying drinks on to the field for the umpires, checking the batteries in the light meter, observing the pitch during the lunch and tea intervals to make sure there is no interference, or bringing on new bails. The Fourth umpire will take over the Third umpire duties if something happens to one of the on- field umpires, as the rules state the third umpire will take over on- field duties. For Test matches, the fourth umpire is appointed by the home side's Governing body from their nominees to the International Panel of ICC Umpires, so is the same nationality as the home side.

It was one of the nation's largest ever delegations sent to the Olympics, due to the historic comeback of the women's field hockey squad after 36 years and the proliferation of track and field athletes making the cut. Among the sporting events represented by its athletes, India made its Olympic debut in golf (new to the 2016 Games) and women's artistic gymnastics.

Sindhu in the women's singles, who became India's youngest individual Olympic medallist and the first Indian woman to win an Olympic silver, as well as a bronze to freestyle wrestler Sakshi Malik in the women's 58 kg, who became the first female wrestler from India to win an Olympic medal. Several Indian athletes came close to increasing the medal haul, finishing in fourth place, including tennis tandem Mirza and Rohan Bopanna in the mixed doubles; Bindra, who narrowly missed out the podium by a half-point in the men's 10 m air rifle before retiring from the sport; and Karmakar, who surprised the global audience with her high-risk Produnova routine in the women's vault.

He was born in Herwigsdorf, now a district of Rosenbach, Oberlausitz, and died in Leipzig at the age of 70.    Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch   Vopelius is primarily remembered for the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch (New Leipzig Hymnal) which he published in 1682. The subtitle of the publication reads: ... Von den schönsten und besten Liedern verfasset, In welchem Nicht allein des sel. Herrn D. Lutheri und andere mit Gottes Wort, und unveränderter Augsburgischer Confession überein stimmende, und in Christlicher Gemeine allhier, wie auch anderer reinen Evangelischen Orten und Landen eingeführete und gebräuchliche Gesänge, Lateinische Hymni und Psalmen, Mit 4. 5. bis 6. Stimmen, deren Melodeyen Theils aus Johann Herman Scheins Cantional, und andern guten Autoribus zusammen getragen, theils aber selbsten componiret; Sondern auch die Passion nach den heiligen Evangelisten Matthaeo und Johanne, die Auferstehung, die Missa, Praefationes, Responsoria und Collecten, auf die gewöhnlichen Sonn- und hohen Festtage, das Magnificat nach den 8. Tonis, Te Deum laudamus, Symbolum Nicaenum, &c. Choraliter, Und was sonsten bey dem ordentlichen Gottesdienste gesungen wird, zu finden Or, translated:... Compiled from the most beautiful and best songs; In which not only songs of the blessed Dr. Luther, and other (songs) with the Word of God, and in accord with the unmodified Augsburg Confession, but also (songs) as introduced and customary in other untainted Evangelical places and regions, and Latin hymns and psalms, set for four, five and up to six voices, the settings of which are partly collected from Johann Herman Schein's Cantional, and from other good authors, and partly also composed by myself, also, in particular, the Passion according to the holy Evangelists Matthew and John, the Resurrection, the Mass, Prefaces, Responsories and Collects, for ordinary Sundays and high Feasts, the Magnificat in the eight tones, Te Deum laudamus, Symbolum Nicenum, etc. choraliter, and whatever else is sung in regular church services, are to be found The Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch is, to a certain degree, a third edition of Johann Schein's Cantional, which originally had been published in 1627, with a new edition in 1645. Over 90 settings in the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch were copied or adapted from Schein. All other composers are represented with less than 10 settings in the hymnal. Of these, only Johann Crüger and Andreas Hammerschmidt are mentioned for more than three settings.    Reception  The Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch was one of the last important hymnals in the Kantional format (i.e. printed with music, including part-songs): congregational singing was generally becoming monodic, with an instrumental accompaniment, for which hymnals with only texts became the new standard. In his Leipzig time (1723–1750), Johann Sebastian Bach used the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch as a reference work for many of his sacred compositions. For the closing chorales of his cantatas BWV 27 and BWV 43 he used the harmonisation as found in the hymnal. For other chorale settings, such as BWV 281, he stayed close to the harmonisation published by Vopelius.    Later editions of the Leipziger Gesangbuch  In 1693 Vopelius published the Leipziger Gesangbuch, which he describes as a republication of the Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch, however without the chorale settings, but with more hymns, and enriched with engravings. The next edition appeared in 1707. Later editions of the Leipziger Gesangbuch, in 1729, 1733 and 1752, further enlarged the number of hymns, to 852, 856 and 1015 respectively, and referred to Vopelius as the former editor of the hymnal. Mädchen in Uniform (\"Girls in Uniform\") is a 1931 German romantic drama film based on the play Gestern und heute (Yesterday and Today) by Christa Winsloe and directed by Leontine Sagan with artistic direction from Carl Froelich, who also funded the film. Winsloe also wrote the screenplay and was on the set during filming. Due to the film's overt and openly lesbian themes, the film remains an international cult classic and enjoys widespread acclaim from critics.    Plot  Manuela von Meinhardis, whose mother had died when she was young and whose father serves in the military, is enrolled at an all-girls boarding school headed by the traditional and iron-fisted Fräulein von Nordeck zur Nidden. Manuela feels out of place in this strict environment. After witnessing Fräulein von Bernburg's compassion for the other girls, Manuela develops a passionate love for her teacher. The first spark of love begins with a goodnight kiss. Manuela receives this goodnight kiss on her first night at the school and, while the teacher normally gives all the girls a goodnight kiss on the forehead, Fräulein von Bernburg kisses her on the lips. After not knowing her recitation for Fräulein von Bernburg's class, Manuela is asked to meet her in her room. Fräulein von Bernburg comments on the state of Manuela's clothes and gives Manuela one of her own petticoats. Manuela begins to weep and, after some time, confesses her love to Fräulein von Bernburg, who says that she cannot give Manuela special treatment. Shortly after, Ilsa von Westhagen, another student, writes a letter to her parents about the conditions of the school and has a worker smuggle it out.   When the girls prepare to put on the play Don Carlos by Friedrich Schiller for the headmistress's birthday, Manuela plays the lead male role, Don Carlos. Ilsa is also supposed to play a large role but is not allowed to perform after her letter is returned to the school. The play is a success, and Fräulein von Bernburg is moved. During the afterparty, the girls are served punch containing alcohol. Manuela drunkenly confesses her love for Fräulein von Bernburg and tells everyone about the petticoat. The headmistress overhears and Manuela passes out after her speech.   The headmistress puts her in solitary, but Manuela is moved out of solitary when the princess arrives at the school. After the duchess (Marte Hein) leaves, the headmistress scolds Fräulein von Bernburg's closeness with her students. Fräulein von Bernburg calls Manuela to her office and explains that Manuela is never to speak to her again.   Upon leaving Fräulein's von Bernburg's office, Manuela prepares to jump from several stories up in the main staircase. The girls save her, and both Fräulein von Bernburg and the headmistress are shaken. The movie ends with all the girls watching the headmistress as she slowly walks down the stairwell and down the hall in shaken silence.    Cast     Production   Winsloe's stage play had previously appeared under the title Ritter Nérestan (Knight Nérestan) in Leipzig with Hertha Thiele and Claire Harden in the lead roles. After Leipzig the play was produced on the stage in Berlin as Gestern und Heute with a different cast and a more prominent lesbian theme, which was again toned down somewhat for the film. Having mostly played the same roles on stage, the cast was able to produce the film at speed and on a low budget of 55,000 ℛ︁ℳ︁. It was largely shot at the Potsdam military orphanage, now a teacher training college for women. Carl Froelich's studio in Berlin-Tempelhof was also used. The film's original working title was Gestern und heute (Yesterday and Today) but this was thought too insipid and changed to increase the chances of box-office success. Although sound had only been used for two years in cinema, it was used artfully. The film was groundbreaking in having an all-female cast; in its sympathetic portrayal of lesbian \"pedagogical eros\" (see Gustav Wyneken) and homoeroticism, revolving around the passionate love of a fourteen-year-old (Manuela) for her teacher (von Bernburg); and in its co-operative and profit-sharing financial arrangements (although these failed). After many screen tests, Winsloe had insisted that her friend Thiele play the lead role. Johann Ludwig Bach (14 February [O.S. 4 February] 1677 – 1 May 1731) was a German composer and violinist. He was born in Thal (Ruhla) near Eisenach. At the age of 22 he moved to Meiningen eventually being appointed cantor there, and later Kapellmeister. He wrote a large amount of music and regularly oversaw performances, both at Meiningen and neighbouring courts. He was a third cousin of Johann Sebastian Bach, who made copies of several of his cantatas and performed them at Leipzig. The cantata Denn du wirst meine Seele nicht in der Hölle lassen, BWV 15, once thought to be by Johann Sebastian, and listed as BWV 15 in Wolfgang Schmieder's catalogue of his works, is now thought to be by Johann Ludwig. Bach died in Meiningen.    Works, editions and recordings   The earliest lists of compositions by Johann Ludwig Bach appeared in the 19th century: Johann Theodor Mosewius listed 16 of his cantatas in 1852, and Alfred Dörffel listed 17 cantatas and the Mass in E minor, with their incipits, in Vol. 41 of the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (1894). The Johann-Ludwig-Bach-Verzeichnis (catalogue of compositions by Johann Ludwig Bach, abbreviated JLB) contains 39 compositions, starting, in the same sequence, with the 17 cantatas listed by Dörffel:  Gott ist unser Zuversicht, sacred cantata for the fourth Sunday after Epiphany.

Nazism made extensive use of the cinema throughout its history. Though it was a relatively new technology, the Nazi Party established a film department soon after it rose to power in Germany. Both Adolf Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels used the many Nazi films to promote the party ideology and show their influence in the burgeoning art form, which was an object of personal fascination for Hitler. The Nazis valued film as a propaganda instrument of enormous power, courting the masses by means of slogans that were aimed directly at the instincts and emotions of the people. The Department of Film also used the economic power of German moviegoers to influence the international film market. This resulted in almost all Hollywood producers censoring films critical of Nazism during the 1930s, as well as showing news shorts produced by the Nazis in American theaters.    Background  The Nazis were very aware of the propagandistic effect of movies and already in 1920 the issues of the Racial Observer included film criticism. The SS-philosopher Walter Julius Bloem published the book The Soul of the Cinema – A Commitment to the Movies in 1922. In September 1923, Philipp Nickel produced a documentary of the \"German Day in Nuremberg\" where the \"Battle-League\" was founded, shortly before the Beer Hall Putsch. Hitler wrote about the psychological effect of images in Mein Kampf:  One must also remember that of itself the multitude is mentally inert, that it remains attached to its old habits and that it is not naturally prone to read something which does not conform with its own pre-established beliefs when such writing does not contain what the multitude hopes to find there. The picture, in all its forms, including the film, has better prospects.  In a much shorter time, at one stroke I might say, people will understand a pictorial presentation of something which it would take them a long and laborious effort of reading to understand. A comprehensive critique of the film industry was published by the Nazi economist Hans Buchner in 1927 with the title \"Spellbound by Movies. The Global Dominance of the Cinema\". Further short Nazi films about party rallies were made in 1927–1929. The first NSDAP film office was established in 1931, and started producing \"documentaries\" in a larger scale, e.g., in 1932 \"Hitlers Kampf um Deutschland\" (Hitler's fight for Germany), \"Blutendes Deutschland\" (Germany is bleeding), \"Das junge Deutschland marschiert\" (The German Youth is on the March). Herbert Gerdes directed five Nazi propaganda films: Erbkrank (1936), Alles Leben ist Kampf (1937), Was du Ererbt (1938), Schuld oder Schein (1921), and Das Große Geheimnis (1920). Nazi propagandist Hans Traub, who had earned his PhD in 1925 with a dissertation on the press and the German revolutions of 1848–49, wrote in the essay \"The film as a political instrument\" in 1932:  Without any doubt the film is a formidable means of propaganda. Achieving propagandistic influence has always demanded a ‘language’ which forms a memorable and passionate plot with a simple narrative. … In the vast area of such ’language’ that the recipients are directly confronted by in the course of technical and economical processes, the most effective is the moving picture. It demands permanent alertness; it’s full of surprises concerning the change of time, space, and action; it has an unimaginable richness of rhythm for intensifying or dispelling emotions.    Goals of the Nazi film policy  Goebbels, who appointed himself \"Patron of the German film\", believed that a national cinema which was entertaining and put glamour on the government would be a more effective propaganda instrument than a national cinema in which the NSDAP and their policy would have been ubiquitous. Goebbels emphasized the will to end the \"shamelessness and tastelessness\" that he thought could be found in the former movie industry. The main goal of the Nazi film policy was to promote escapism, which was designed to distract the population and to keep everybody in good spirits; Goebbels indeed blamed defeat in World War I on the failure to sustain the morale of the people. The open propaganda was reserved for films like Der Sieg des Glaubens and Triumph des Willens, records of the Nuremberg rallies, and newsreels. There are some examples of Nazi-era feature films that deal with the NSDAP or with party organizations such as the Sturmabteilung, Hitler Youth or the National Labour Service, one example being Hitlerjunge Quex about the Hitler Youth. Another example is the anti-semitic feature film Jew Suss. Tic Tac Toe were a German girl group formed in 1995, performing pop-rap music. Their first two albums, Tic Tac Toe and Klappe die 2te, were million-selling commercial successes and spawned major hits \"Ich find' dich scheiße\", \"Verpiss' dich\" and \"Warum?\". The band found biggest popularity in German speaking countries, the Netherlands and Eastern Europe. Due to numerous scandals and personal issues between the group members, Tic Tac Toe split in 2001. The band had a successful but short-lived comeback in 2005 with the hit single \"Spiegel\", but ultimately disbanded in 2007.    History     1995–1996: Formation and debut album  The band was established in 1995 by three young women from the industrial Ruhr area: Lee (Liane Wiegelmann), Ricky (Ricarda Wältken) and Jazzy (Marlene Tackenberg). Claudia Wohlfromm was the group's manager, and together with her partner Torsten Börger co-wrote all the songs for Tic Tac Toe. To appeal to young audience, the official band biography stated that all girls were in their teens, although only Ricky was actually a teenager when the group was formed. Their first single was \"Ich find' dich scheiße\" in 1995, which caused a media stir due to its explicit title which translates \"I Think You're Shit\". The song became a major hit in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and was followed by the band's self-titled debut album in the spring of 1996. It was a commercial success, reaching top 5 in the charts and going multi-platinum. The album spawned further singles, \"Funky\" and \"Leck mich am A, B, Zeh\", the latter song being about safe sex. However, it was the fourth single, provocatively titled \"Verpiss' dich\" (English: \"Fuck Off\"), that became the band's first number 1 hit in Germany as well as Switzerland. Their public feud with fellow German rapper Sabrina Setlur was widely reported by the music press.    1997–1998: Second album and controversies  In 1997 the band released their second album, Klappe die 2te. It became another multi-platinum success, topping German and Swiss albums charts, and has sold over 1.1 million copies in Germany alone. The lead single was \"Warum?\", whose lyrics were based on the story of a friend who had died of drug overdose. The track went to number 1 in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and remains Tic Tac Toe's biggest hit. Reggae-influenced \"Mr. Wichtig\" was released as the second single and reached the top 10. Two following singles, including \"Bitte küss' mich nicht\", a song about sexual harassment, charted outside the top 20. During this time the press began writing unflattering articles about the band. The band members' true ages were revealed, and their biographies were reported to have been fabricated by the group. Liane Wiegelmann's marital status was made public when her husband committed suicide. It was also reported that Wiegelmann was using drugs, and that she had been involved in child prostitution when she was 16 years old. Tensions between the band members escalated, and Ricky Wältken was reported to be struggling with stress-related issues. To prevent further damage to the band's image, their record company called a press conference in Munich in November 1997 to contradict the scandalous revelations and demonstrate the band's unity. However, the event took an unexpected turn when Ricky clashed against the rest of the band and the girls started to publicly argue and blame each other. The conference ended with Lee leaving the room in tears. As a result, Tic Tac Toe's popularity dramatically decreased. Ricky immediately left the band and embarked on a solo career releasing several modestly successful singles, although her solo album failed to chart.    1999–2009: Comeback and definitive split  Lee and Jazzy performed as a duo for some time, before Sara Brahms joined the band. They recorded a single \"Nie wieder\" as Sara @ Tic Tac Two which was a chart success in 1999 and was later included on Sara's solo album. In 2000, the band released their third studio album, Ist der Ruf erst ruiniert..., recorded with Sara under their original moniker Tic Tac Toe. Three singles promoted the album, of which the most successful was \"Isch liebe disch\". The album itself didn't fare as well in the charts as its predecessors and still in 2000 the trio disbanded. Tic Tac Toe reformed in the original line-up in 2005, after Ricky had rejoined. Ich für dich, du für mich is a 1934 German film directed by Carl Froelich.

Biography     Apparatus builder and cameraman  From 1903 Froelich was a colleague of Oskar Messter, one of the advance guard of German cinema, for whom initially he worked on the construction of cinematographic equipment. As cameraman for Messter's weekly newsreels he filmed among many other things the aftermath of a train accident on the Berlin elevated railway on 28 September 1908, one of the worst transport disasters of the time.    Film director and producer  Between 1912 and 1951 he made 77 films. In 1913 Froelich made his directorial debut with Richard Wagner. In 1920 he founded his own production company, Froelich-Film GmbH, among the productions of which were Kabale und Liebe (1921), Die Brüder Karamasoff (1922), and Mutter und Kind (1924). During these years he often filmed with the actress Henny Porten, who made her screen debut in one of his earliest films, and with whom between 1926 and 1929 he shared ownership of a production company. In 1929 Froelich made the first German sound film, Die Nacht gehört uns (\"The Night Belongs To Us\"). In 1930 he took over two glasshouses in Berlin-Tempelhof, which had been used as studios in the days of silent film, and had them converted to sound film studios. Here he produced many films, including Rolf Hansen's short film Das Schönheitsfleckchen (1936) (\"The Beauty Spot\"), the first German drama film in colour.  In 1931 he was advisor, as \"senior artistic director\", to Leontine Sagan's famous boarding-school film and later lesbian classic, Mädchen in Uniform (\"Girls in Uniform\") (1931). By 1933 Froelich was one of Germany's most noted film artists, producing successful films with the stars of the period, among others Hans Albers, Heinz Rühmann, Ingrid Bergman and Zarah Leander. Some of the best-known of the films he made during this period were:  1934: Ich für dich, du für mich for the Reich Propaganda Directorate of the NSDAP 1938: Heimat 1940: Das Herz der Königin (\"The Queen's Heart\"), an anti-British historical film about Mary, Queen of Scots 1941: Der Gasmann, a propaganda film, in which Heinz Rühmann plays a gas-meter reader suspected of being a foreign spy    Culture politics  Froelich became a member of the National Socialist Party in 1933 and took over the direction of the Gesamtverbandes der Filmherstellung und Filmverwertung (\"Union of Film Manufacture and Film Evaluation\"). In 1937 he was awarded a professorship and in 1939 was appointed president of the Reichsfilmkammer, an office which he retained until the end of the war in 1945. The Reichsfilmkammer was subordinate to the Reichskulturkammer, which as a National Socialist trade organisation regulated and controlled access to all artistic professions.  He was one of the few filmmakers that received the title \"Filmprofessor\" from Goebbels.    After the end of the war  After the end of the war Froelich was arrested and in 1948 de-Nazified. His studio had been badly damaged during the war and did not resume production. Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.

California Redwood Coast – Humboldt County Airport( Arcata Airport) is in Humboldt County, California, north of Arcata and north of Eureka, in McKinleyville, California. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011 – 2015 categorized it as a\" Nonhub primary commercial service\" airport. The airport is a federally designated port of entry for civil aircraft arriving in the United States. The airport is the site of the command center for and primary facilities of the United States Coast Guard Air Station Humboldt Bay, which provides rescue and law enforcement for the region north of the San Francisco Bay Area. California Redwood Coast – Humboldt County Airport (IATA: ACV, ICAO: KACV, FAA LID: ACV), also known as Arcata–Eureka Airport and Arcata Airport, is in Humboldt County, California, United States, 8 miles (13 km) north of Arcata and 15 miles (24 km) north of Eureka, in McKinleyville. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a Nonhub primary commercial service airport.  The airport is a federally designated port of entry for civil aircraft arriving in the United States. The airport is the site of the command center for and primary facilities of the United States Coast Guard Air Station Humboldt Bay, which provides rescue and law enforcement for the region north of the San Francisco Bay Area.    History  The airport was built by the United States Navy during World War II to test defogging systems. It operated in support of the Naval Air Station Alameda as the Arcata Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) and was headquarters for the Eureka section of naval local defense forces for the 12th Naval District. In December 1947 a Southwest Airways Douglas DC-3 made the world's first blind landing by a scheduled commercial airliner using Ground-Controlled Approach (GCA) radar, Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO) oil-burners next to the runway. By the following year the airline had made 1,200 routine instrument landings at the often fog-shrouded airport.    Facilities   The airport covers 745 acres (301 ha) at an elevation of 222 feet (68 m). It has two asphalt runways: 14/32 is 6,046 by 150 feet (1,843 by 46 m) and 01/19 is 4,501 by 150 feet (1,372 by 46 m). The airport is under the jurisdiction of the California Coastal Commission and major changes to the airport such as rezoning or fencing in the airport require its approval. The approach path for runway 32 passes over Central Avenue. The glare of the strobe lights that direct planes to the runway were a hazard for drivers, especially during rain when the strobes' intensity increased and the road reflected the blinking lights. Baffles were installed on the strobes which block the lights from shining on the road while still guiding aircraft.    Airlines and destinations     Passenger     Statistics  In the year period ending May 31, 2019, the airport had 42,174 aircraft operations, average 116 per day: 61% military, 25% general aviation, and 14% airline. 24 aircraft at the time were based at the airport: 18 single-engine, 3 multi-engine, and 3 helicopters.    Top destinations     Current airline service  Scheduled flights are currently operated by SkyWest Airlines flying as United Express on a code sharing basis on behalf of United Airlines with three or four nonstop flights per day to SFO on Canadair CRJ-200 and Embraer 175 regional jets as well one nonstop flight per day to both LAX and Denver International Airport. SkyWest Airlines also operated American Eagle service from the airport via a code sharing agreement on behalf of American Airlines with nonstop flights to the American hub in Phoenix (PHX) operated with Canadair CRJ-700 regional jets. The service started June 3, 2021, and ended August 15, 2022. Daily nonstop service to Denver International Airport (DEN) began on June 7, 2019. Service has increased significantly since 2015, with five new destinations (LAX, DEN, BUR, PHX, & LAS), and passenger departures have increased 56%. On May 19, 2021, new nonstop scheduled passenger service to Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR) operated by Avelo Airlines was initiated with Boeing 737-800 mainline jetliners which are currently the largest aircraft type serving the airport. Avelo added service to Las Vegas Harry Reid International Airport in November 2021. The service ended on May 2, 2022, resumed on September 8, 2023, and ended again January 8, 2024. On November 9, 2021, new nonstop scheduled service to Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO) operated by Aha! Airlines was initiated with Embrear 145s. Aha! ended service to Reno on March 30, 2022.

Lafayette Regional airport does not have international flights; however, regional jet service is operated nonstop to four hubs: Atlanta (ATL), Charlotte (CLT), Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) and Houston (IAH).    Historical airline service  Eastern Airlines began the first service to Lafayette in the latter 1940's with flights to Houston and New Orleans that made intermediate stops. Eastern ended their service in 1966. Trans-Texas Airways began service in the latter 1950's with flights to Dallas, Houston, and New Orleans, all with intermediate stops. Trans-Texas became Texas International Airlines in 1969 and was merged into Continental Airlines in 1982. Continental continued serving Lafayette with nonstop service to Houston and was merged into United Airlines in 2012. American Eagle with service on behalf of American Airlines began nonstop flights to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) in 1984. MetroFlight, the codeshare affiliate for American Eagle, had begun the flights to DFW under their own branding the year before in 1983. American Eagle nonstop service to Charlotte, NC was added in 2021.   Delta Connection with service on behalf of Delta Air Lines began service to DFW in 1987 and later added one-stop flights to Atlanta. Delta mainline Boeing 717-200 jet service nonstop to Atlanta was added on July 3, 2014, in addition to its regional jet flights operated by Delta Connection, however the mainline service was soon discontinued. Northwest Airlink with service on behalf of Northwest Airlines began flights to its hub in Memphis, Tennessee in 1991.

Frontier ended its seasonal service to Orlando from Lafayette in August 2019 and then ended its seasonal service from Lafayette to Denver on November 10, 2019, with flights to both cities planned to resume in the spring of 2020. However, Frontier has since stated it will not be resuming flights from Lafayette with its service now suspended indefinitely.    Passenger growth  The airport serves the greater Lafayette metropolitan area as well as nearby New Iberia and other population centers in south central Louisiana, which has a combined population of approximately 530,000 people. In 2019, 527,460 passengers flew in and out of the airport, the highest in its history.    Facilities and aircraft  Lafayette Regional Airport (LFT) covers 746 acres (302 ha) at an elevation of 42 feet (13 m) above mean sea level. The airport officially operates two asphalt runways: 4R/22L, 8,000 by 150 feet (2,438 by 46 metres) and 11/29, 5,400 by 148 feet (1,646 by 45 metres). It has one helipad, 50 ft × 50 ft (15 m × 15 m). The airport previously had a third runway (4L/22R) which was parallel to 4R/22L and served for GA aircraft, however that runway was disabled after the airport built a new cargo ramp on the approach of the 4L’s path. That runway is now used as a taxiway.  During the years in which the airport’s new terminal was being constructed, 4R/22L was the only active runway at the airport, as 11/29 was closed for additions and repaving.

McKinleyville is located 5.25 miles (8.4 km) north of Arcata, at an elevation of 141 feet (43 m). The population was 15,177 at the 2010 census, up from 13,599 at the time of the 2000 census. This unincorporated community is the third largest community, after Eureka and Arcata, on the far North Coast. It is also the location of the Arcata–Eureka Airport, the largest airport in Humboldt County and the region.    History  The Wiyot and Yurok people continue to live here in their traditional territories and both groups are ingrained within the McKinleyville community. McKinleyville is a community made up of a combination of smaller settlements. Joe Dows settled in the general area in the 1860s and that area was known as Dows Prairie. Slightly south was a small community called Minor (also known as Minorville). Minor was first settled in the late 19th century. Just south of Minor was Calville. Calville was settled by the employees of the California Barrel Company. After President William McKinley was assassinated in 1901, the community of Minor changed its name to McKinleyville in his honor. All three areas are collectively considered to be part of McKinleyville. The first post office at McKinleyville opened in 1903, closed in 1921, and was reopened in 1955. McKinleyville is a community with mainly retail and professional businesses to serve its residents but is not an incorporated city or town.    Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 21.0 square miles (54 km2), of which 20.8 square miles (54 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2), or 1.2%, is water. McKinleyville consists of several watershed areas. The north bank of the Mad River is the farthest watershed to the south. The next watershed to the north is Mill Creek, then Widow White Creek, Norton Creek, Strawberry Creek, Patrick Creek and finally the farthest watershed to the north is the south bank of the Little River. To the west lies the Pacific Ocean.    Climate  The area sees summers that are not as foggy as Eureka and Arcata to the south, and run a few degrees warmer. McKinleyville has a cool-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csc) typical of the North Coast that is characterized by mild, rainy winters and cool, mild summers, with an average temperature of 55°F (13 °C). The area experiences coastal influence fog all year round.    Demographics   2010 The 2010 United States Census reported that McKinleyville had a population of 15,177. The population density was 722.2 inhabitants per square mile (278.8/km2). The racial makeup of McKinleyville was 13,010 (85.7%) White, 103 (0.7%) African American, 700 (4.6%) Native American, 211 (1.4%) Asian, 17 (0.1%) Pacific Islander, 338 (2.2%) from other races, and 798 (5.3%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1,081 persons (7.1%). The Census reported that 15,098 people (99.5% of the population) lived in households, 79 (0.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 0 (0%) were institutionalized. There were 6,283 households, out of which 1,979 (31.5%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 2,784 (44.3%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 691 (11.0%) had a female householder with no husband present, 386 (6.1%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 619 (9.9%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 58 (0.9%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 1,731 households (27.6%) were made up of individuals, and 515 (8.2%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40. Salt Lake City International Airport (IATA: SLC, ICAO: KSLC, FAA LID: SLC) is a joint civil-military international airport located about 4 miles (6.4 km; 3.5 nmi) west of Downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. The airport is the closest commercial airport for more than 3 million people and is within a 30-minute drive of nearly 1.3 million jobs. The airport serves as a hub for Delta Air Lines and is a major gateway to the Intermountain West and West Coast. The airport sees 343 scheduled nonstop airline departures per day to 93 cities in North America and Europe. It is by far the busiest airport in Utah. Salt Lake City International Airport continues to rank high for on-time departures/arrivals and the fewest flight cancellations among major US airports. The airport ranked first for on-time departures and arrivals and first for the percentage of cancellations as of April 2017. The airport is owned by the City of Salt Lake City and is administered by the municipal Department of Airports.    History     1900 to 1940  In 1911, a site for an air field was chosen on Basque Flats, named for Spanish-French sheep herders who worked the fields in the then-desolate area of the Salt Lake Valley, where a cinder-covered landing was subsequently created. The Great International Aviation Carnival was held the same year and brought aviation pioneers representing Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company and a team representing the Wright Brothers to Salt Lake City. World-famous aviator Glenn H. Curtiss brought his newly invented Seaplane to the carnival, a type of airplane that had never been demonstrated to the public. Curtiss took off from the nearby Great Salt Lake, awing the 20,000 spectators and making international headlines. For several years, the new field was used mainly for training and aerobatic flights. That would change in 1920 when the United States Postal Service (USPS) began air mail service to Salt Lake City. The city bought a 100-acre tract around Basque Flats for $4,000 and built a field, hangar and other facilities. In the same year, the airfield was given the name Woodward Field, named for John P. Woodward, a local aviator. The first transcontinental air mail flight landed at Woodward Field on September 8. In 1925, the postal service began awarding contracts to private companies. Western Air Express, the first private company to carry U.S. mail, began flying from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles via Las Vegas. Less than a year later Western Air Express would begin flying passengers along the same route. Western Air Express later became Western Airlines, which had a large hub in Salt Lake City. Charles Lindbergh visited Woodward Field in 1927, drawing many spectators to see The Spirit of St. Louis. During the next few years the airport would gain another runway and would span over 400 acres (1.6 km2). In 1930 the airport was renamed Salt Lake City Municipal Airport. The first terminal and airport administration building was built in 1933 at a cost of $52,000. By then, United Airlines had begun serving Salt Lake City on flights between New York City and San Francisco.  As air travel became more popular and the United States Army Air Forces established a base at the airport during World War II, a third runway was added (Runway diagram for 1955). The April 1957 Official Airline Guide (now OAG) shows 42 weekday departures: 18 on Western, 17 United and 7 Frontier. United had flown nonstop to Chicago since 1950, but nonstop service to New York did not start until 1968. The first jets were United 720s in September 1960.    1960 terminal  A new terminal was needed and work began on the west side of the airport on Terminal 1, designed by Brazier Montmorency Hayes & Talbot and dedicated in 1960 after seven years of work and a cost of $8 million. In 1968, the airport became Salt Lake City International Airport when a non-stop route to Calgary, Canada was awarded to Western Airlines. After airline deregulation in 1978, hub airports appeared. Western Airlines, with ties to Salt Lake City since its inception, increased service into hub status on May 1, 1982. Terminal 2 was designed by Montmorency Hayes & Talbot and built solely for Western and had several murals by artist LeConte Stewart. During the 1980s, the airport saw further expansion to both terminals as well as runway extension. In 1987, Western Airlines merged with Delta Air Lines. Salt Lake City would continue to be a major airline hub for Delta. In 1991, the airport opened a new short-term parking garage. Arcata (; Wiyot: Goudi’ni; Yurok: Oket'oh) is a city adjacent to the Arcata Bay (northern) portion of Humboldt Bay in Humboldt County, California, United States. At the 2020 census, Arcata's population was 18,857. Arcata was first founded in 1850 as Union, was officially established in 1858, and was renamed Arcata in 1860. It is located 280 miles (450 km) north of San Francisco (via Highway 101), and is home to California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. Arcata is also the location of the Arcata Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for the administration of natural resources, lands and mineral programs, including the Headwaters Forest, on approximately 200,000 acres (810 km2) of public land in Northwestern California.    History     Indigenous Native American  The Wiyot people and Yurok people inhabited this area prior to the arrival of Europeans and continue to live in the area. \"Kori\" is the name for the Wiyot settlement that existed on the site of what would become Arcata. The name \"Arcata\" comes from the Yurok term oket'oh, meaning \"where there is a lagoon\" (referring to Humboldt Bay), from o-, \"place\", plus ket'oh, \"to be a lagoon\". The same name was also used by the Yuroks for Big Lagoon. The natives of this region are the farthest-southwest people whose language has Algic roots, a language family shared with the Algonquian. The traditional homeland of the Wiyot ranged from the Little River in the north and continues south through Humboldt Bay (including the present cities of Eureka and Arcata) and then south to the lower Eel River basin. The traditional homeland of the Yurok ranges from Mad River to beyond the Klamath River in the north. Today, Arcata is the headquarters of the Big Lagoon Rancheria tribe, who maintain a 20-acre (81,000 m2) reservation close by. Local Indian tribes operate several casinos in the area. In a coordinated 1860 massacre, significant numbers of Wiyot people were killed by white settlers at several locations in and around Humboldt Bay, including the center of their society, the island known to them as Duluwat Island. A local newspaper editor, who would later be known as Bret Harte, was forced to leave the Humboldt Bay area after he editorialized his disgust with the incident.    Westernization   The Spaniards claimed the area but never settled it; the first permanent settlements occurred after California was admitted to the Union. Arcata was first settled as Union in 1850. Union was created as a port, and reprovisioning center for the gold mines in the Klamath, Trinity, and Salmon mountains to the east, and was very briefly the county seat during this period. It was slightly closer to the mines than Eureka, which gave Union an early advantage. What was to become the first significant town on Humboldt Bay began as Union Company employees laid out the plaza and first city streets in the Spring of 1850. By later in the 1850s redwood timber replaced the depleted gold fields as the economic driver for the region and Eureka became the principal city on the bay due to its possession of the better harbor, gaining it the county seat by the end of the decade. The Union town post office opened in 1852, and the town changed its name to Arcata in 1860. In 1886, concern over the growing number of unassimilated immigrants led Arcata to expel its Chinese population and enact the following resolution: \"We, the citizens of Arcata and vicinity, wish the total expulsion of the Chinese from our midst. We endorse the efforts of Eureka to exclude all Chinese settlements in the city and environs.\" History and images of early settler families in Arcata are cataloged in the Susie Baker Fountain Papers and True Hoyle Collection at California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt. These collections also include images of important social events in the Arcata area, such as graduations at Arcata High School as early as 1910, as well as images of social gatherings at the Arcata plaza before the Statue of William McKinley (Arcata, California) was erected in the center from 1906 until its relocation in 2019.    Recent history  In August 1989, the voters of Arcata passed the Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Act, prohibiting work on nuclear weapons, and the storage or transportation of nuclear weapons within the city limits. The ordinance also minimized the city's contracts for and purchases of the products and services of nuclear weapons contractors.

Martin and Dela LeBleu were among the first to settle near Lake Charles, in the area called LeBleu Settlement. They arrived in Lake Charles in 1781 from Bordeaux, France, and settled approximately six miles east of present- day Lake Charles, Louisiana. Soon after, many immigrants began arriving in the area to settle. Among them was Charles Anselm Sallier. Charles Sallier moved to Lake Charles and married the LeBleus' daughter, Catherine. They settled near Lake Charles( the lake) and had six children. As legend tells it, one day Charles Sallier thought that Catherine was having an affair with Jean Laffite. In rage, he shot at his wife and assumed she was dead. In guilt and regret, Charles ran off. However, Catherine had survived the shot by only a simple piece of jewelry – her brooch. She continued her life raising the six children in Lake Charles. Soon after, Lake Charles residents began calling the area\" Charlie's Lake,\" and by the late 19th century, the area where Charles Sallier once lived was called\" Charleston,\" or\" Charles Town.\" Eventually it became known as\" Lake Charles.\" Cairo Regional Airport, is a county- owned public- use airport located northwest of the central business district of Cairo, Illinois, a city in Alexander County, Illinois, United States. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration( FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019 – 2023, in which it is categorized as a local general aviation facility. The two closest airports with commercial airline service are Cape Girardeau Regional Airport and Barkley Regional Airport which are both about away. Humboldt County ( ) is a county located in the U.S. state of California. As of the 2020 census, the population was 136,463. The county seat is Eureka. Humboldt County comprises the Eureka–Arcata–Fortuna, California, Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is located on the far North Coast of California, about 270 miles (435 km) north of San Francisco. It has among the most diverse climates of United States counties, with very mild coastal summers and hot interior days. Similar to the greater region, summers are extremely dry and winters have substantial rainfall. Its primary population centers of Eureka, the site of College of the Redwoods main campus, and the smaller college town of Arcata, site of California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, are located adjacent to Humboldt Bay, California's second largest natural bay. Area cities and towns are known for hundreds of ornate examples of Victorian architecture. Humboldt County is a densely forested mountainous and rural county with about 110 miles (177 km) of coastline (more than any other county in the state), situated along the Pacific coast in Northern California's rugged Coast (Mountain) Ranges. With nearly 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km2) of combined public and private forest in production, Humboldt County alone produces twenty percent of the total volume and thirty percent of the total value of all forest products produced in California. The county contains over forty percent of all remaining old growth Coast Redwood forests, the vast majority of which are protected or strictly conserved within dozens of national, state, and local forests and parks, totaling approximately 680,000 acres (1,060 sq mi).    History  The original inhabitants of the area now known as Humboldt County include the Algic Wiyot, Yurok; the Hokan Karuk; and the Athapaskan Hupa, Chilula, Whilkut, Tsnungwe as well as the Eel River Athapaskan peoples, including the Wailaki, Mattole and Nongatl. Spanish traders made unintended visits to California with the Manila Galleons on their return trips from the Philippines beginning in 1565. The first recorded entry by people of European origin was a landing by the Spanish in 1775 in Trinidad. The first recorded entry of Humboldt Bay by non-natives was an 1806 visit from a sea otter hunting party from Sitka employed by the Russian American Company. The hunting party included Captain Jonathan Winship, an American, and some Aleut hunters. The bay was not visited again by people of European origin until 1849 when Josiah Gregg's party visited. In 1850, Douglas Ottinger and Hans Buhne entered the bay, naming it Humboldt in honor of the great naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt, and the name was later applied to the county as a whole. The area around Humboldt Bay was once solely inhabited by the Wiyot Indian tribe. One of the largest Wiyot villages, Tolowot, was located on Indian Island in Humboldt Bay. Founded around 900 BC, it contains a shell midden 6 acres (2.4 ha) in size and 14 feet (4.3 m) deep. It was the site of the February 26, 1860, massacre of the Wiyot people that was recorded by Bret Harte, then living in Union, now called Arcata. Between 60 and 200 Wiyot men, women, and children were murdered that night in the midst of a religious ceremony. Tolowot is now a restricted site and a National Historic Landmark. In 2019, the island was restored to the Wiyot tribe, and is now known as Tuluwat or Duluwat island. Humboldt County was formed in 1853 from parts of Trinity County. State historic landmarks in Humboldt County include Arcata and Mad River Railroad, California's First Drilled Oil Wells in Petrolia, Camp Curtis, Centerville Beach Cross, the city of Eureka, the Victorian town of Ferndale, Fort Humboldt, Humboldt Harbor Historical District, the Jacoby Building, The Old Arrow Tree, Old Indian Village of Tsurai, the Town of Trinidad, and Trinidad Head. On February 5 and 6, 1885, Eureka's entire Chinese population of 300 men and 20 women were expelled after a gunfight between rival Chinese gangs (tongs) resulted in the wounding of a 12-year-old boy and the death of 56-year-old David Kendall, a Eureka City Councilman. After the shooting, an angry mob of 600 Eureka residents met and informed the Chinese that they were no longer wanted in Eureka and would be hanged if they were to stay in town longer than 3 p.m. the next day. Lake Charles is the fifth-most populous city in the U.S. state of Louisiana, and the parish seat of Calcasieu Parish, located on Lake Charles, Prien Lake, and the Calcasieu River. Founded in 1861 in Calcasieu Parish, it is a major industrial, cultural, and educational center in the southwest region of the state. As of the 2020 U.S. census, Lake Charles's population was 84,872. The city and metropolitan area of Lake Charles is considered a regionally significant center of petrochemical refining, gambling, tourism, and education, being home to McNeese State University and Sowela Technical Community College. Because of the lakes and waterways throughout the city, metropolitan Lake Charles is often called the Lake Area.    History   On March 7, 1861, Lake Charles was incorporated as the town of Charleston, Louisiana. Lake Charles was founded by merchant and tradesman Marco Eliche (or Marco de Élitxe) as an outpost. He was a Sephardic Jewish trader of either Basque-Spanish or Venetian-Italian origins. He had arrived in Louisiana after hitchhiking and was invited onto a Spanish vessel due to his determination and loyalty to volunteer and work freely for the Spanish Empire. Long before incorporation and even before the Louisiana Purchase, other names for Lake Charles were Porte du Lafitte (Port of Jean Lafitte) or Rivière Lafitte (River Lafitte/Lafitte's River), among many other names now lost. Eliche had also founded other outposts and towns in Louisiana prior, most notably Marksville, which is named after him. There are also urban tales he had planned to name the settlement Nouveau Cadix (New Cádiz)\", after the city in Spain, but this is uncertain. The town was first incorporated in 1857 as Charleston, after an early settler, Charles Sallier. Ten years later, on March 16, 1867, Charleston was reincorporated as the City of Lake Charles. The Great Fire of April 1910 devastated much of the city. Lake Charles soon rebuilt, grew and expanded in the twentieth century. The Charleston Hotel was completed in 1929, during the administration of Mayor Henry J. Geary. During and after World War II, Lake Charles experienced industrial growth with the arrival of petrochemical refineries. The city grew to a high of some 75,000 people in the early 1980s, but with local economic recession, the population declined and stagnated. In 1985, the city was identified as a potential Strategic Homeport to support Navy Secretary John Lehman's desire for a 600-ship Navy. Support ships were to be operated from the new Naval Station Lake Charles; but with the tailing-off of the Cold War, the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended it be closed. By 1991, the incomplete base was dropped from the program and shuttered. In 2005, the city was heavily damaged by Hurricane Rita. In 2020, it was battered by two hurricanes, Category 4 Hurricane Laura on August 26–27, and Hurricane Delta on October 9, 2020. Lake Charles after the hurricane was described as if “20 tornadoes came in and wiped the city”. The southern portion of the city was damaged by an EF2 tornado on October 27, 2021, and an EF1 tornado caused minor damage to downtown Lake Charles on May 13, 2024.    Geography   Lake Charles, located on a level plain about 30 miles (48 km) from the Gulf of Mexico, has an elevation of approximately 13 feet (4.0 m) above sea level, and is located on the banks of the Calcasieu River in southwestern Louisiana. It borders both Lake Charles and Prien Lake. Contraband Bayou, Henderson Bayou, and English Bayou flow through the city. Oak trees and pine trees dot the landscape; the lumber industry was once the main economic engine of the area. The Calcasieu Ship Channel, which allows large ocean-going vessels to sail up from the Gulf, also borders the city. The 2010 census recorded Lake Charles total land size was 48.6 sq miles was to 2023 census records Lake Charles being 61.35 sq miles in total size.  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 44.8 square miles (116.0 km2), of which 42.0 square miles (108.9 km2) is land and 2.7 square miles (7.1 km2), or 6.12%, is water.    Climate  Lake Charles is tied with Port Arthur, Texas, and Astoria, Oregon, as the most humid city in the contiguous United States, and the second-most humid measured location behind unincorporated Quillayute, Washington.

Airlines and destinations     Historical airline service  Historically, Lake Charles was served by Eastern Air Lines beginning in the late 1940s with Martin 4-0-4 and Convair 340 twin prop \"Silver Falcon\" airliner flights to Houston via Beaumont/Port Arthur and also to Baton Rouge and New Orleans via Lafayette.  Some eastbound flights operated by Eastern continued on with direct, no change of plane service to Atlanta, New York/Newark Airport and Boston, although a number of intermediate stops were made en route. In 1958, Eastern was operating daily round trip Convair 340 service on a routing of Brownsville - Corpus Christi - Houston Hobby Airport - Beaumont/Port Arthur - Lake Charles - Lafayette - Baton Rouge - New Orleans - Mobile - Pensacola - Montgomery - Birmingham - Atlanta.   Eastern ceased all flights to Lake Charles during the mid 1960s when it withdrew its Convair 440 propliner service. Trans-Texas Airways (TTa) began serving Lake Charles during the mid 1950s with Douglas DC-3 aircraft flying a routing of Lafayette - Lake Charles - Shreveport - Longview, TX - Tyler, TX - Dallas Love Field - Fort Worth. By 1959, TTa had expanded its DC-3 service with direct flights to Houston via Beaumont/Port Arthur and also direct to Jackson, MS via Alexandria and Natchez, MS. Trans-Texas then introduced Convair 240 service and in 1961 was flying nonstop to Houston and Monroe, LA as well as direct to Dallas, New Orleans, Little Rock, Memphis, San Antonio and other destinations.   By the mid 1960s, Trans-Texas was serving the airport with Convair 600 turboprop flights primarily to Houston, New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Trans-Texas Airways subsequently changed its name to Texas International Airlines (TI) and introduced Douglas DC-9-10 jetliner service from Lake Charles to Houston and New Orleans with direct service to Dallas/Ft.

Mani Rimdu is a 19-day festival celebrated by Buddhists in the Everest region of Nepal to mark the founding of Buddhism by Guru Rinpoche Padmasambhava.Magnificent shows are put up on at the monasteries of Tengboche, Thame and Chiwong. The Mani-rimdu festival consists of a series of thirteen acts involving various elements of religious ceremonialism, dance and drama. A huge crowd of Lamas and Sherpa meet at the monastery for the welfare of the world. They enjoy the festival with masked dances, prayers and feasts.\nMani Rimdu is observed from the first day of the tenth month of the Tibetan lunar calendar which falls between October and November under the English calendar. \n\n\n== Origin ==\nMani Rimdu began at Rongpuk Monastery in Tibet in the early 1900s, at the initiative of Ngawang Tenzin Norbu, who had studied in Mindroling Monastery, in Central Tibet. Like much of Rongpuk Monastery practice, most of the rituals that comprise Mani Rimdu find their source at Mindroling Monastery, the great Nyingma monastery in Central Tibet.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn the 1980s-1990s, Richard J. Kohn worked on university research focused on the Mani Rimdu. The Mani Rimdu festival is performed in the Sherpa and Tibetan monasteries of Solu Khumbu District in the Everest region of Nepal: Chiwong, Thami, Tengboche Monastery. Nowadays, Mani Rimdu is the biggest event of the year for the Sherpas of the Khumbu region.\n\n\n== Rinpoche's Reincarnation ==\nThe high lama head of the Sakya order of Tibetan Buddhism, will get information about the successor Rinpoche. After he gives a name, monks must form groups and look for the chosen family.\nThe reincarnated Rinpoche will next have to pass a test, which will include recalling events from the prior Tengboche Rinpoche's life. Following passing the exam, he will be dispatched to various monasteries for instruction, after which the Rinpoche's post at Tengboche would be reclaimed.\n\n\n== Mani Rimdu 2022 ==\nThe Tibetan Lunar calendar is used to determine the Mani Rimdu festival's date. The Mani Rimdu is performed in Tengboche during the ninth Tibetan month, which usually coincides with the full moon in October or November. The Mani Rimdu Festival will be held in 2022 on the 8th, 9th, and 10 November.\n\n\n== References == Country Code:+ 247< br> International Call Prefix: 00 Ascension Island does not share the same country code( +290) with the rest of St Helena.

Tengboche Monastery (or Thyangboche Monastery), also known as Dawa Choling Gompa, in the Tengboche village in Khumjung in the Khumbu region of eastern Nepal is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery of the Sherpa community. Situated at 3,867 metres (12,687 ft), the monastery is the largest gompa in the Khumbu region of Nepal. It was built in 1916 by Lama Gulu with strong links to its mother monastery known as the Rongbuk Monastery in Tibet. In 1934, it was destroyed by an earthquake and was subsequently rebuilt. In 1989, it was destroyed for a second time by a fire and then rebuilt with the help of volunteers and international assistance. Tengboche monastery is amidst the Sagarmatha National Park (a UNESCO World Heritage Site of \"outstanding universal value”), draped with a panoramic view of the Himalayan Mountains, including the well-known peaks of Tawache, Everest, Nuptse, Lhotse, Ama Dablam, and Thamserku. Tengboche is the terminus site of the \"Sacred Sites Trail Project\" of the Sagarmatha National Park that attracts large number of tourists for trekking and mountaineering. It is a circular trail that covers 10 monasteries in a clockwise direction terminating in the Tengboche Monastery.    History  The Khumbu valley, where the monastery is, came under the influence of Buddhism about 350 years back. Ancient scriptures of Tibet refer to this valley along with Rowlang and Khanbalung valleys as sacred places. Lama Sangwa Dorje is referred to as the founder of the oldest monastery in Khumbu at Pangboche as well as many other small hermitages. His divine psychic knowledge and clairvoyant vision had prophesied suitability of establishing a monastery at Tengboche based on a footprint on a rock left by him while meditating. However, the actual establishment of the monastery happened only during Ngawang Tenzin Norbu's time; Norbu was considered Sangwa Dorje's fifth incarnation. He had established a monastery at Rongbuk in Tibet on the northern face of Mount Everest. He blessed Chatang Chotar, known as Lama Gulu, to found the Tengboche monastery at Tengboche village. As a result, it got established at its present location in 1916. It is the first celibate monastery under the Nyingmapa lineage of the Vajrayana Buddhism. Many older village-level monasteries are close by. Three wealthy inhabitants of the local Sherpa community are credited with funding building of the monastery. Among these three, Karma was the most influential and well known as he was a tax collector, and he also enjoyed the patronage of the Rana rulers of Nepal. It is said that apart from Khumbu Sherpas, Sherung Sherpas have been involved with building this monastery. Some of the village temples, chortens and smaller religious shrines are predated to 1880, particularly all the large chortens. The Mani wall, made of slabs of stone inscribed with prayers and sacred texts is dated to 1915. The monastery was destroyed during the 1934 earthquake. Subsequently, Lama Gulu who had built it died. His successor, Umze Gelden, took up the task of rebuilding, with strong support from Ngawang Tenzin Norbu. The monks and the local community, with support from a skilled carpenter from Lhasa, re-established the monastery. Exclusive murals were painted by Kappa Kalden, a renowned artist. With an influx of tourists to the Khumbu region, particularly for trekking by mountaineers, the monastery has received wide recognition. However, the monastery's precious old scriptures, statues, murals and wood carvings were destroyed in the devastating fire caused by an electrical short circuit on 19 January 1989. The monumental stone credited with Lama Sangwa Dorje's left footprint had fractured. A few trekkers managed to salvage some books and paintings. It has since been completely rebuilt with money donated from around the world.   Following the destruction of the monastery by fire, its rebuilding was undertaken by the present Nawang Tenzing Jangpo who is considered as the incarnation of the founder Lama Gulu, an important spiritual leader of the Sherpas. He has established an equation with many trekkers and climbers of all denominations who visit the monastery, which has helped him in finding funds for restoration. With due diligence to the set religious practices, the monastery has been substantially rebuilt.

        "question": "When was the director of film Mr. Moto Takes A Chance born?",
        "answer": "December 13, 1903",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When was the director of film Mr. Moto Takes A Chance born?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nNorman Foster Ramsey Jr. (August 27, 1915 – November 4, 2011) was an American physicist who was awarded the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of the separated oscillatory field method (see Ramsey interferometry), which had important applications in the construction of atomic clocks. A physics professor at Harvard University for most of his career, Ramsey also held several posts with such government and international agencies as NATO and the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Among his other accomplishments are helping to found the United States Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory and Fermilab.    Early life  Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. was born in Washington, D.C., on August 27, 1915, to Minna Bauer Ramsey and Norman Foster Ramsey. His mother was the daughter of German immigrants and an instructor at the University of Kansas. His father, who was of Scottish descent, was a 1905 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and an officer in the Ordnance Department who rose to the rank of brigadier general during World War II, commanding the Rock Island Arsenal. He was raised as an Army brat, frequently moving from post to post, and lived in France for a time when his father was Liaison Officer with the Direction d'Artillerie and Assistant Military Attaché. This allowed him to skip a couple of grades along the way, so that he graduated from Leavenworth High School in Leavenworth, Kansas, at the age of 15. Ramsey's parents hoped that he would go to West Point, but at 15, he was too young to be admitted. He was awarded a scholarship to the University of Kansas, but in 1930 his father was posted to Governors Island, New York. Ramsey therefore entered Columbia University in 1931 and began studying engineering. He became interested in mathematics and switched to this as his academic major. By the time he received his BA from Columbia in 1935, he had become interested in physics. Columbia awarded him a Kellett Fellowship to Cambridge University, where he studied physics at Cavendish Laboratory under Lord Rutherford and Maurice Goldhaber, and encountered notable physicists, including Edward Appleton, Max Born, Edward Bullard, James Chadwick, John Cockcroft, Paul Dirac, Arthur Eddington, Ralph Fowler, Mark Oliphant and J. J. Thomson. At Cambridge, he took the tripos in order to study quantum mechanics, which had not been covered at Columbia, resulting in being awarded a second BA degree by Cambridge. A term paper Ramsey wrote for Goldhaber on magnetic moments caused him to read recent papers on the subject by Isidor Isaac Rabi, and this stimulated an interest in molecular beams and in doing research for a PhD under Rabi at Columbia. Soon after Ramsey arrived at Columbia, Rabi invented molecular-beam resonance spectroscopy, for which he was awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1944. Ramsey was part of Rabi's team that also included Jerome Kellogg, Polykarp Kusch, Sidney Millman and Jerrold Zacharias. Ramsey worked with them on the first experiments making use of the new technique and shared with Rabi and Zacharias in the discovery that the deuteron was a magnetic quadrupole. This meant that the atomic nucleus was not spherical, as had been thought. He received his PhD in physics from Columbia in 1940 and became a fellow at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., where he studied neutron–proton and proton–helium scattering.    World War II     Radiation laboratory   In 1940, he married Elinor Jameson of Brooklyn, New York, and accepted a teaching position at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The two expected to spend the rest of their lives there, but World War II intervened. In September 1940 the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new technologies to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field, which promised to revolutionize radar. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee established the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop this technology. Ramsey was one of the scientists recruited by Rabi for this work. Initially, Ramsey was in Rabi's magnetron group. When Rabi became a division head, Ramsey became the group leader. The role of the group was to develop the magnetron to permit a reduction in wavelength from 150 centimetres (59 in) to 10 centimetres (3.9 in), and then to 3 centimetres (1.2 in) or X band. Microwave radar promised to be small, lighter and more efficient than older types. Ramsey's group started with the design produced by Oliphant's team in Britain and attempted to improve it. Mr. Moto Takes a Chance is the fourth in a series of eight films starring Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto, although it was the second one actually filmed, following \"Think Fast, Mr. Moto\". Its release was delayed until after production of \"Thank You, Mr. Moto\" and \"Mr Moto's Gamble\". The film is based on the character of Mr. Moto created by John P. Marquand, and an original story by Norman Foster and Willis Cooper. Mr. Moto Takes a Chance is the fourth in a series of eight films starring Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto, although it was the second one actually filmed, following Think Fast, Mr. Moto. Its release was delayed until after production of Thank You, Mr. Moto and Mr Moto's Gamble. The film is based on the character of Mr. Moto created by John P. Marquand, and an original story by Norman Foster and Willis Cooper.    Plot  Over the ruins of Angkor Wat in Cambodia flies the airplane of aviatrix Victoria Mason, supposedly circumnavigating the world.  Her actual destination is the kingdom of Tong Moi in French Indochina. Already in Tong Moi, Mr. Moto is posing as an archeologist, and newsreel cameramen Marty Weston and Chick Davis are traveling up the river. Once she is overhead, Mason lights a flare and bails out of her smoking plane which crashes nearby. Rescued by Moto, Mason goes into the village with Bokor the head priest of Shiva. As Weston and Davis arrive at the crash site, Moto has discovered the flare that “caused” the accident. While trying to film Mason and Tong Moi's ruler, the Rajah Ali, Keema, the Rajah's favorite wife mysteriously dies.  Bokor claims that the foreigners and their camera caused her death and they are taken away for a trial. Meanwhile, Moto finds the true cause of Keema's death, a poison dart. At the temple of Shiva, Weston and Davis are pronounced guilty and are about to be thrown into a pit when an elderly guru appears.  The guru impresses Bokor with his ability to charm a snake and to not be burned by a flaming poker.  Bokor releases the foreigners at the orders of the guru. The following day Moto offers to pay the cameramen for images of the interior of the temple. They agree, and return to the temple with Mason.  The three are confronted by the elderly guru who tosses their camera down the well. Bokor, seeing this, asks the guru to kill the foreigner, Moto. The guru agrees and returns to the temple, there discovering a concealed ammunition cache.  After disposing of a guard, the guru disappears into a secret passageway. There he reveals himself to be Mr. Moto, in disguise. Moto writes a note saying that he discovered the ammunition and that Bokor is the leader of the revolt. He sends the message off by carrier pigeon but the Rajah kills the bird and intercepts the message. Later at a feast held in honor of the visitors, Moto is served the cooked bird on his plate and the Rajah reveals that he got the message. In his cabin, Moto is marking the secret ammunition cache on a map of the temple when one of Bokor's men comes in to kill him.  After killing the intruder, Moto disguises himself as the assassin and sneaks into the night. Bokor begins searching Moto's cabin but is interrupted by Mason, who finds the hidden map. Bokor and his men follow Mason to the temple and capture her. The guru appears and pretends to hypnotize the captive.  Meanwhile, Weston followed Mason to the temple and tries unsuccessfully to rescue her. Bonfire signals are made and Capt. Zimmerman the gun-runner arrives with Davis, who is taken captive as well. Zimmerman has been selling weapons to Bokor so that Bokor can start a revolution and depose the Rajah Ali.  Zimmerman is killed by Yao in “payment” for his services. When Mason reveals Moto's identity, a fight ensues. Yao is killed and Bokor escapes and rounds up Zimmerman's men. The four inside the temple hold off the men with the weapons that were just delivered. Mason reveals that she is a British Secret Service agent and Moto reveals that he is also a spy. Rajah Ali arrives with his army and rounds up Bokor and his men.  The Rajah's plan is to use the weapons Bokor purchased to revolt against the French. As the Rajah prepares to have Moto and the two cameramen executed, Mason distracts him so Moto can threaten to blow up the ammunition cache. The Rajah falls into the cache and the four heroes escape down the secret passage as the temple explodes. All ends well with Mason and Weston beginning a romance and Davis planning on becoming Moto's assistant. Davis faints when Moto tells him that his next assignment is to capture a murderer living on a volcanic island as the guest of headhunters.    Cast  Peter Lorre as Mr. Kentaro Moto Rochelle Hudson as Victoria Mason Robert Kent as Marty Weston J. Edward Bromberg as Rajah Ali Chick Chandler as Chick Davis George Regas as Bokor Frederick Vogeding as Capt. Wendy Ann Foster (née  Cheesman; 1937 – 15 January 1989) was a British architect and co-founder of Team 4 and Foster Associates.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nTeam 4 was an architectural firm, established in 1963 by architecture graduates Su Rogers (née Brumwell), Wendy Cheesman, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. The firm originally included Wendy Cheesman's sister, Georgie Wolton, who, as the only qualified architect of the group, allowed the practice to function. Georgie Cheesman left after only a few months, leaving the remaining members to try to pass their professional exams while continuing to practice.\nThe notable buildings that she worked on while at Team 4, includes the first ever house to win a RIBA award - Creek Vean house, Feock, Cornwall, England (1966), Reliance Controls factory, Swindon (1967), Jaffe House (also known as Skybreak House), which was Humphrey Spender's house, Maldon, Essex (1965-1966) and Wates Housing, Coulsdon, Surrey (1965), all in England.\nBy June 1967, Foster and Rogers, had both decided to dissolve the firm. The Rogerses (Richard and Su) established Richard and Su Rogers Architects and the Fosters (Norman Foster and Wendy Foster, née Cheesman) established Foster Associates. The notable buildings that Wendy Foster was involved in include Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Willis Faber and Dumas building, and the HSBC Building in Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nA new age of architecture, rooted in British Modernism, emerged in the late 1960s. Heavily influenced by new-age engineering practices, this high-tech style of architecture aimed to accentuate the building’s construction. This transformational era in the field of architecture was dominated by male designers, Norman Foster among them. However, what many fail to realize is the number of female architects who not only influenced, but helped the movement thrive. Wendy Foster, as a member of Team 4, aided in the design of the Reliance Controls factory–a manufacturing site for precision electronic tools–which became one of the first high-tech buildings in the United Kingdom. Her contributions to the movement were essential to its rise and the lasting fame of her and her partners’ firm.\n\n\n== Private life ==\nWendy Cheesman married Norman Foster in 1964. She died of cancer in 1989, aged 51, when she was still a partner/director at Foster Associates.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of British architects\n\n\n== References == Mr. Moto ’s Last Warning is the sixth in a series of eight films starring Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto. The film is an original story featuring the character created by John P. Marquand. Mr. Moto is a fictional Japanese secret agent created by the American author John P. Marquand. He appeared in six novels by Marquand published between 1935 and 1957. Marquand initially created the character for the Saturday Evening Post, which was seeking stories with an Asian hero after the death of Charlie Chan's creator Earl Derr Biggers. In various other media, Mr. Moto has been portrayed as an international detective. These include eight motion pictures starring Peter Lorre between 1937 and 1939, 23 radio shows starring James Monks broadcast in 1951, a 1965 film starring Henry Silva, and a 2003 comic book produced by Moonstone Books, later reprinted as Welcome Back, Mr. Moto.    Character in the novels  In Marquand's novels, the character calls himself I.A. Moto, and some other characters believe this to be a fairly obvious alias, since \"moto\" is usually the second part of a Japanese surname, as in Hashimoto. Though Mr. Moto is shrewd, tough and ruthless against his enemies, to most people in most situations he appears to be a harmless eccentric who sometimes calls himself stupid. The main characters in the novels are Westerners who encounter Mr. Moto in the course of their adventures in exotic lands and gradually come to realize what a formidable character he is. In the first five novels, set in the era of expansionist Imperial Japan, Mr. Moto is an agent of the empire. In the final novel, set in the 1950s inside Japan, he is a senior intelligence official in the pro-Western Japanese government.    Physical description  He is physically described in Think Fast, Mr. Moto:  Mr. Moto was a small man, delicate, almost fragile. … He was dressed formally in a morning coat and striped trousers.  His black hair was carefully brushed in the Prussian style.  He was smiling, showing a row of shiny gold-filled teeth, and as he smiled he drew in his breath with a polite, soft sibilant sound.  This basic description carries through most of the novels, with a slightly different description in Right You Are, Mr. Moto, set 20 years later than the other novels.  In this novel he is described as  \"middle aged\", and his hair as being \"grayish and close-clipped.\" In two novels, Marquand describes Mr. Moto's build as \"chunky\". He is often described as wearing formal evening clothes that are impeccably tailored.  On occasion his sartorial style is somewhat misguided such as in Mr. Moto Is So Sorry when he appears in black-and-white checked sports clothes with green and red golf stockings. When his outfits are commented upon, Mr. Moto makes excuses. In Stopover: Tokyo, he is said to have the imposing dignity of his samurai forebears when dressed in traditional Japanese clothing.    Speech  In the prewar novels, Moto speaks a faintly comic English, with elaborate 'Oriental'-style politeness, with misuse of the definite and indefinite articles. In Stopover: Tokyo, the final novel, he works directly with U.S. intelligence agents and speaks to them in perfect English.    Personal life  Mr. Moto rarely discusses his personal life but in Think Fast, Mr. Moto he talks about his many talents.  Yes, I can do many, many things.  I can mix drinks and wait on table, and I am a very good valet.  I can navigate and manage small boats.  I have studied at two foreign universities.  I also know carpentry and surveying and five Chinese dialects.  So very many things come in useful.  In Mr. Moto Is So Sorry he states that one of the foreign universities was in America where he studied anthropology.  It is noted in this novel that he has enough knowledge of America to distinguish regional accents. The novels generally involve a romance between the main character (often a disenfranchised expatriate American) and a mysterious woman. While Mr. Moto often despairs of the hero's attempts at saving the girl, he notes in Mr. Moto Is So Sorry that he himself is not immune to their charms.  \"So often\", he said, \"I have seen such gracious ladies disrupt political combinations.\"  He sighed and still stared at the ceiling seemingly lost in memory. \"Such a lovely girl in Washington – I was so much younger then. She sold me the navy plans of a submarine.  The price was thirty thousand yen.  When the blueprints came, they were of a tugboat. Such a lovely lady. Such a lovely lady in Tokyo. She took me to see the goldfish in her garden, and there were the assassins behind the little trees. Not her fault, but theirs that I am still alive – they were such poor shots. Thank You, Mr. Moto is a 1937 film directed by Norman Foster. It is the second in a series of eight films starring Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto. It was based on the novel of the same name by the detective's creator, John P. Marquand.

Thank You, Mr. Moto is a 1937 American mystery film directed by Norman Foster. It is the second in a series of eight films starring Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto. It was based on the novel of the same name by the detective's creator, John P. Marquand. Mr. Moto battles murderous treasure hunters for priceless ancient scrolls which reveal the location of the long-lost tomb of Genghis Khan.    Plot  A caravan settles for the night in the Gobi Desert. A man sneaks into a tent to steal a scroll, but adventurer and soldier of fortune Kentaro Moto (Peter Lorre) is only pretending to be asleep and kills him. When the caravan reaches Peiping, Moto is searched by the police. The scroll is found, but Moto grabs it and escapes. He changes clothes and accepts an invitation to a party hosted by Colonel Tchernov (Sig Rumann) in honor of American Eleanor Joyce (Jayne Regan). At the soirée, Moto observes a guest, Prince Chung (Philip Ahn) leaving his mother to speak privately with Tchernov in another room. Tchernov offers to buy certain family heirloom scrolls from Chung. When Chung refuses to part with them, Tchernov draws a pistol but is killed (off-screen) by Moto. Joyce stumbles upon the scene and watches Moto stages the death to look like a suicide. Later, as a favour to his rescuer, Chung grants Moto's request to see the scrolls. Chung informs him that the seven scrolls give directions to the lost grave of Genghis Khan and his treasure. However, one scroll was lent to an exhibition and was stolen. A dealer in antiquities, Pereira (John Carradine), shows Joyce some wares. She is interested in a (fake) scroll, but the price is too high. While shopping the next day with diplomat Tom Nelson (Thomas Beck), they see Moto entering Pereira's shop. Moto gets Pereira to confess that he stole the authentic scroll, but before he can obtain more information, Pereira is shot and killed by a gunman in a car which speeds away. Moto returns to his apartment to find it ransacked. Sensing that the intruder is still present, Moto leaves his gun lying around. Schneider (Wilhelm von Brincken) holds him at gunpoint and forces Moto to give him the scroll. When Moto tries to flee, Schneider shoots him with Moto's own gun. However, the gun was filled with blanks and Moto trails Schneider to Madame Tchernov (Nedda Harrigan). When they leave to rendezvous with their gang, Moto starts to follow, but is knocked out by the butler, Ivan (John Bleifer). Joyce, who had been comforting the widow, is taken hostage. The arch-villain (and Madame Tchernov's lover), Herr Koerger (Sidney Blackmer), forces Prince Chung to reveal the location of the scrolls by striking his mother. As they are leaving, Madame Chung attacks Koerger with a knife and is killed. Meanwhile, Nelson finds and revives Moto. They rush to help Prince Chung, but arrive too late and, feeling dishonored, the Prince commits suicide after they untie him; Moto comforts him before he dies by promising to avenge the Chung family and safeguard the tomb. The two men track the criminals to a junk. After another attempt to kill him, Moto informs Koerger that the scroll he gave Schneider is a fake. He offers to split Genghis Khan's treasure. Then he sows dissent by telling Madame Tchernov that Koerger is actually in love with Joyce, which the quick-thinking American \"confirms\". This provides a distraction for Moto to kill Koerger. Then, to the dismay of Joyce and Nelson, Moto burns the scrolls to fulfill his promise to Chung.

The New York Times praised the book's \"vitality and vividness\". In June 1937 Fox said the first three movies in the series would be Think Fast, Mr Moto, Thank You Mr Moto and Mr Moto's Gamble. Think Fast had been filmed in February. The second Moto film actually shot was Look Out Mr Moto (which became Mr. The following is a list of films set wholly or partially in Shanghai.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of films based on location\nList of films set in Hong Kong\nList of films set in Macau\nList of fiction set in Shanghai\n\n\n== References == Iva Stewart( 1914–1985) was an American model and film actress. She was Miss Maine, and competed in Miss America 1933. She moved to Hollywood where she had a mixture of supporting roles and more minor appearances in glamorous roles in studio films. Amongst her appearances was in the 20th Century Fox series film\" Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation\". Mr. Moto's Gamble is the third film in the Mr. Moto series starring Peter Lorre as the title character. It is best remembered for originating as a movie in the Charlie Chan series and being changed to a Mr Moto entry at the last minute. The Return of Mr. Moto( also known as Mr Moto and the Persian Oil Case) is a 1965 British crime film directed by Ernest Morris and starring Henry Silva, Terence Longdon, and Suzanne Lloyd. Think Fast, Mr. Moto is a 1937 American mystery film directed by Norman Foster and featuring a mysterious Japanese detective named Mr. Moto. It is the first of eight films in the Mr. Moto series,  all based on the character Mr. Moto created by John P. Marquand. The film stars Peter Lorre as the title character (at the time, it was customary for Westerners to portray Asians on the screen), Virginia Field, Thomas Beck and Sig Ruman. Mr. Moto works to stop a secret smuggling operation.    Plot  The film opens with Mr. Moto in disguise as a street salesmen and selling goods to passers-by.  He sees a man leaving a shop with a tattoo of the British Flag on his arm. Moto enters the shop to sell a rare diamond to the owner. However, Moto sees a body stuffed into a wicker basket in the store, and using his mastery of  judo takes down the shopkeeper. Later, he reserves a berth on a passenger liner headed for Shanghai. Also on the liner is Bob Hitchings Jr., son of the owner of the shipping line. Before leaving, Hitchings Sr. gives his son a confidential letter for the head of the Shanghai branch of the company. Hitchings and Moto become friends (Moto notices the letter), and Moto helps Hitchings cure a hangover. Hitchings complains to Moto that he has not met any beautiful women on board. After a stop in Honolulu, a beautiful woman named Gloria Danton boards the ship, and she and Hitchings fall in love. But Gloria is a spy for Nicolas Marloff, who runs a smuggling operation out of Shanghai. She periodically sends him notes and leaves without saying goodbye to Hitchings. Moto finds a steward looking for Hitchings’ letter and confronts him, knowing he was the person who killed the man in the wicker basket, as he wears the tattoo. Moto throws the man overboard and takes the letter. At Shanghai, Hitchings meets with Joseph B. Wilkie and gives him the letter, but later learns that it is a blank sheet of paper. He calls his father, who tells him the letter said to watch out for smugglers. Hitchings is determined to find Gloria, and he learns from an unknown person that she is at the \"international club\". Both he and Wilkie go there, as well as Moto and his date, Lela Liu. Hitchings finds Gloria performing at the club and goes to her dressing room. However, the club owner Marloff discovers them together and, knowing that Hitchings knows too much, locks them both up. Moto tells Lela to call the police, and seeks out Marloff. Posing as a fellow smuggler, he tricks Marloff into leading him to Gloria and Hitchings. Lela is shot while contacting the police, but manages to tell them where she is. Wilkie finds Marloff, and demands that Gloria and Hitchings be released. Marloff finds out that Moto is not a smuggler, then Moto apprehends him. Moto tells Wilkie to get Marloff's gun, the gun explodes as Wilkie tries to grab it, killing Marloff. Police storm the building, and Moto tells them the Wilkie headed the smuggling operation. Wilkie replaced the letter and shot Lela. Moto gave Wilkie the opportunity to kill Marloff, who knew he was in on the plot, and he did. Wilkie is arrested, and things go back to normal.

Carrol Naish as Adram    Original novel  Think Fast, Mr. Moto was the third novel in the Moto series. Film rights to the novel were bought in July 1936. It was originally a story That Girl and Mr Moto. The novel was not published until May 1937.    Production     Development  Mr Moto had been introduced to readers in the 1935 novel No Hero. It was popular and was followed by Thank You, Mr Moto in 1936 and then Think Fast, Mr Moto in 1937. Twentieth Century Fox had three film series at the time – Charlie Chan, the Jones Family, and the Jeeves movies – and thought Mr Moto would make an ideal hero of a film series along the lines of Charlie Chan. In July 1936 Fox announced that they had bought the film rights to Think Fast, Mr Moto and Kenneth MacGowan would produce. MacGowan refused to produce and the film became a \"B\" movie. In January 1937 Fox announced that Peter Lorre would play Moto and that Think Fast would co-star Virginia Field. Mr Moto Takes A Vacation( 1939) is a Norman Foster- directed entry in the Mr. Moto film series, with Lionel Atwill and Joseph Schildkraut and G. P. Huntley, as Archie Featherstone, in supporting roles. This was the last Mr. Moto film that Peter Lorre appeared in. The movie was the seventh filmed in the series. However it was not released until after\" Mr. Moto in Danger Island\", which was the last filmed out of eight Mr. Moto films from 20th Century Fox. Mr. Moto's Gamble is the third film in the Mr. Moto series starring Peter Lorre as the title character. It is best remembered for originating as a movie in the Charlie Chan series and being changed to a Mr. Moto entry at the last minute.    Plot  In San Francisco, policeman Lieutenant Riggs (Harold Huber) takes Mr. Moto, a detective and Lee Chan (Keye Luke), a student, to a prizefight between Bill Steele (Dick Baldwin) and Frank Stanton (Russ Clark), where the winner will take on the champion, Biff Moran (Ward Bond). However, the fight is fixed and gangster Nick Crowder (Douglas Fowley) bets big money that Stanton won't make it to the fifth round. He goes down in the fourth and dies shortly afterward. Bookie Clipper McCoy (Bernard Nedell) loses a fortune. Moto proves that it was murder and it is revealed that $100,000 was won in bets around the country against Stanton. Moto works with Lt. Riggs to solve the murder as the championship fight looms. Comedy is provided by Horace Wellington (Maxie Rosenbloom), a kleptomaniac, and Lee Chan. Moto promised to reveal the murderer's identity on the night of the big fight, but the murderer has plans, too, with a concealed gun, to kill Moto.    Cast  Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto Keye Luke as Lee Chan Dick Baldwin as Bill Steele Lynn Bari as Penny Kendall Douglas Fowley as Nick Crowder Jayne Regan as Linda Benton Harold Huber as Lieutenant Riggs Maxie Rosenbloom as Horace Wellington John Hamilton as Philip Benton George E.

At the same time, the studio announced three Charlie Chan movies starring Warner Oland, Charlie Chan on Broadway, Charlie Chan at College and Charlie Chan in Radio City. In July, Fox said Rochelle Hudson would be in Mr Moto's Gamble. This became Look Out Mr Moto which became Mr. Moto Takes a Chance.    Charlie Chan at Ringside  Fox were going do make a Charlie Chan film called Charlie Chan at Ringside starring Warner Oland as Chan and Keye Luke as Number One Son. Jayne Regan was cast on the strength of her performance in Thank You, Mr Moto. The cast would also include Lynn Bari and be directed by Norman Tinling. Filming started in January 1938, but Oland left the film due to illness that month and the production was suspended. In March 1938, Fox announced Oland would return to the role and appear in Charlie Chan on the Clipper Ship. However he  never recovered from his illness and died in August 1938. Sidney Toler took over the role of Charlie Chan in the ongoing film series. Fox had spent an estimated $100,000 on the film already when shooting had to be called off. Wanting to salvage something of the situation and reluctant to cast a different actor as Charlie Chan, Sol Wurtzel, head of Fox's B movie unit, had the script rewritten as a Mr. Moto movie. Two Charlie Chan regulars appeared in the film – Keye Luke, who plays Charlie Chan's son Lee, and Harold Huber, who plays Lt Riggs. Lee Chan is Moto's student in his  criminology class at San Francisco University. Moto mentions that he has heard from Charlie Chan in Honolulu. Moto says he and the head of the homicide squad are mere amateurs compared to Charlie Chan. Filming recommenced in January 1938. Lon Chaney Jr. had a small role. Filming finished late March 1938, the fourth movie shot in the Moto series.    Release  The film was released relatively quickly in April 1938. The New York Times liked the fight sequences but called it \"an otherwise unexciting film\". The next film shot in the series would be Mysterious Mr. Moto.    Home media  This film, along with Mr. Moto in Danger Island, Mr. Moto's Last Warning, Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation and (as a DVD extra) The Return of Mr. Moto, was released on DVD in 2007 by 20th Century Fox as part of The Mr. Norman Foster (born Norman Foster Hoeffer, December 13, 1903 – July 7, 1976) was an American actor, film director and screenwriter. He directed many Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto films as well as projects for Orson Welles and Walt Disney. As an actor he was a leading man in early talkies and also appeared in Welles’ final film \"The Other Side of the Wind\". == Life and career ==\nNorman Foster was born Norman Foster Hoeffer on December 13, 1903, in Richmond, Indiana. He became a cub reporter on a local newspaper in Indiana before going to New York in the hopes of getting a better newspaper job but there were no vacancies.\nHe tried a number of theatrical agencies before getting stage work including The Barker (1927, New York; 1928, London) in which he appeared opposite future wife Claudette Colbert. \nHe later appeared on Broadway in the George S. Kaufman/Ring Lardner play June Moon in 1929. He began working in crowd scenes in films before moving to bigger parts.\nFoster wrote several plays. He gave up acting in the late 1930s to pursue directing, although he occasionally appeared in movies and television programs. Foster directed a number of Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto mysteries, including Charlie Chan in Panama (1940), Charlie Chan at Treasure Island (1939), Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation (1939), Charlie Chan in Reno (1939), Mr. Moto's Last Warning (1939), Mysterious Mr. Moto (1938), Mr. Moto Takes a Chance (1938), Thank You, Mr. Moto (1937), and Think Fast, Mr. Moto (1937). He co-wrote and directed the \"My Friend Bonito\" segment of Orson Welles's unfinished Pan-American anthology film It's All True (1941).: 310–311  \nInitially engaged as a second-unit director who would film background material,: 189  Foster came to do much more and the quality of his work would have been recognized with a co-director credit on the film.: 31–34  A co-production of RKO Pictures and the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, the non-commercial project was later terminated by RKO.: 41 \nAs Welles prepared to go to Brazil to film the Rio Carnival for It's All True, he temporarily suspended \"Bonito\" (for which filming was never completed) so Foster could return to Hollywood to direct Journey into Fear (1943). Welles played a small on-screen role in the Mercury Production, and denied that he took over direction of the film himself.: 155 \nSome of Foster's other directorial efforts include Kiss the Blood off My Hands (1948), Rachel and the Stranger (1948), Woman on the Run (1950) and The Sign of Zorro (1958). He directed the Davy Crockett segments of the Walt Disney anthology television series Disneyland that were edited into the feature films Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier (1955) and Davy Crockett and the River Pirates (1956). Foster's second verse of his lyrics to Disney's Zorro theme song which was \"He is polite, but the wicked take flight, when they catch the sight of Zorro. He's friend of the weak, and the poor, and the meek, this very unique Senor Zorro.\" never aired on the television series. This version of the Zorro Theme including these verses was performed by The Chordettes. These verses later appeared in the Disney Sing-Along Songs version of the Zorro Theme in its 1987 direct-to-video episode, \"Heigh-Ho\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1928, Foster secretly married Claudette Colbert in London. Concerned about the reaction of Colbert's mother to their union, they continued to keep their marriage a secret from her, even to the point of living apart. \nIn 1935, they divorced, and Foster in October that same year married actress Sally Blane, sister of actress Loretta Young. They had two children: Gretchen (named for Loretta Young, whose birth name was Gretchen) and Robert.\n\n\n== Theatre credits ==\n\n\n== Film and television credits ==\n\n\n=== Actor ===\n\n\n=== Director === Think Fast, Mr. Moto is a 1937 film directed by Norman Foster and featuring a mysterious Japanese detective named Mr. Moto.

The Cocoanut Grove show featured Garland with Freddy Martin's Orchestra, rather than others like Nelson Riddle or Billy May.\nWilliam Ruhlmann of Allmusic awarded the album four stars, writing: \"from the spring of 1951 on, Judy Garland's reputation rested on her abilities as a live act, but it took another eight years before her first commercially recorded live album was issued by Capitol Records (ST 1118) ... The audience is enthusiastic, especially toward the end, when, coming out for her encores, Garland asks for requests and gets plenty. Even without the visual complement (and said to be suffering from laryngitis, which is only occasionally evident), she is clearly a powerful performer with a strong connection to her listeners.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nGarland Overture: \"The Trolley Song\"/\"Over the Rainbow\"/\"The Man That Got Away\" (Ralph Blane, Hugh Martin)/(Harold Arlen, Yip Harburg)/(Arlen, Ira Gershwin) – 3:39\n\"When You're Smiling (The Whole World Smiles with You)\" (Mark Fisher, Joe Goodwin, Larry Shay) – 3:19\n\"Day In, Day Out\" (Rube Bloom, Johnny Mercer) – 3:11\n\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\" (Dorothy Fields, Jimmy McHugh) – 5:02\n\"Zing!

Cohan which was a hit on Broadway in 1922 and 1923.  The film was written by Jack McGowan and directed by Norman Taurog. Its cast included Judy Garland, George Murphy, Charles Winninger and Douglas McPhail.\nThe film is notable for containing Judy Garland's only on-screen death scene, but she re-appears in the film as the daughter of the character who died.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Ireland, Jerry Kelly (George Murphy) marries his sweetheart Nellie Noonan (Judy Garland) over the objections of her ne'er-do-well father Michael Noonan (Charles Winninger), who swears never to speak to Jerry again, even though he reluctantly accompanies the newlyweds to the U.S., where Jerry becomes a policeman and all three become citizens. Michael continues to hold his grudge against Jerry even when Nellie dies shortly after giving birth to her daughter, also named Nellie.\nYears later, Jerry is now a captain on the police force, and Nellie (also played by Judy Garland) has grown up as the spitting image of her mother. Michael dotes on his granddaughter but is embarrassed when she sings in public at the police department parade (It's a Great Day for the Irish). He uses a supposed weak heart, for which he takes a tot of whiskey from a medicine bottle, to get his way with Nellie and to avoid work. When Nellie becomes enamored with Dennis Fogarty (Douglas McPhail), the son of Michael's old friend Timothy Fogarty (Arthur Shields), the conflict in the home intensifies. Jerry is happy for her, but Michael objects to the romance, and when Nellie, encouraged by her father, finally stands up to him, he leaves home.\nEventually, the three generations are reconciled, and Nellie and Dennis remain a couple.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJudy Garland as Nellie Noonan Kelly and as Little Nellie Kelly\nGeorge Murphy as Jerry Kelly\nCharles Winninger as Michael \"Mike\" Noonan\nDouglas McPhail as Dennis Fogarty\nArthur Shields as Timothy Fogarty\nRita Page as Mrs. Mary Fogarty\nForrester Harvey as Moriarity\nJames Burke as Police Sergeant McGowan\nGeorge Watts as Mr. Keevan, NYC Bar Owner\n\n\n== Songs ==\nJudy Garland sings a swing version of \"Singin' in the Rain\" more than 10 years before Gene Kelly famously sang it in his film Singin' in the Rain (1952) as well as sings several newer songs, including the traditional \"A Pretty Girl Milking Her Cow\" sung partly in Irish-Gaelic. There are also two production numbers, one set at the New York City Policeman's Ball and the other written by Roger Edens. In the latter, Garland sings \"It's A Great Day for the Irish\" while marching in New York City's St. Patrick's Day Parade. This song became one of Garland's bigger hits.\nSongs cut from the film include \"Rings on Your Fingers and Bells on Your Toes\" (used in Garland's later film Babes on Broadway, 1941), \"Danny Boy\" and \"How Can You Buy Killarney\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nAfter the success of The Wizard of Oz (1939), the film was a \"test\" by MGM to evaluate both Garland's audience appeal and her physical image. It was rumored at the time that George M Cohan sold the rights expressly as a vehicle for Garland. The film gave 18-year-old Garland the opportunity to grow up as she is in the first half of the picture set in Ireland, in which she plays Nellie Noonan, the mother of Little Nellie Kelly. Although called \"a bit of Blarney\", overall the film was well-received. Critics noted Garland \"gets prettier with each picture\".\n\n\n== Box office ==\nAccording to MGM records, the film earned $968,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,078,000 in other markets, resulting in a profit of $680,000.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nThe film was released on DVD on March 15, 2011.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of films set in Ireland\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nLittle Nellie Kelly at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nLittle Nellie Kelly at IMDb\nLittle Nellie Kelly at the TCM Movie Database\nLittle Nellie Kelly at AllMovie\nLittle Nellie Kelly at the Judy Garland Online Discography\nIrish in Film Thomas Scott( 1907- date of death unknown) was an English diver. A Pretty Girl Milking Her Cow (Cailin Deas Crúite na mBó in the Irish language) is a traditional 18th-century Irish ballad. The English version is attributed to Thomas Moore (1779–1852). Originally sung in Irish Gaelic, the song was popular through the early 20th century. It enjoyed a revival when an updated swing version sung by Irish-American singer/actress Judy Garland was featured in the 1940 film Little Nellie Kelly. The updated version is true to the original musical air, and incorporated original lyrics by MGM Musical Director Roger Edens,\nand featured Garland singing the song to George Murphy using some of the original Gaelic lyrics in the first chorus, which was true to the traditional air, before moving into an up-tempo swing version typical of the era. The song was released as the B-side of the more popular Garland song It's A Great Day for the Irish by Decca Records in 1940. It became a popular song for Irish-Americans during St Patrick's Day celebrations. It remained a popular number for Garland throughout her career, and most notably she sang it live in its original Irish language version in July 1951 at her Theatre Royal concerts in Dublin, Ireland. A Dublin review stated: \"Remember the song she sang in \"Nellie KellyThe Pretty Girl Milking Her Cow.\" Judy is providing herself with the Irish version – \"Cailin Deas Cruidte na mBo\" while in Ireland\". Later in 1951, she included the song in her first record-breaking appearance at New York's Palace Theatre, although this time reverting to the new version that combined both English- and Irish-language lyrics. The song is also featured on Garland at the Grove on Capitol Records, recorded live in 1958 at the Coconut Grove in Hollywood. Singers and groups including Bing Crosby, Ruby Murray, Eileen Barton, Carmel Quinn, Clannad, The Fureys, Blackthorn Ceilidh Band, Runa and The Chieftains, Altan among others, have recorded the song in either form or a combination of both. Duck Baker recorded a fingerstyle guitar arrangement. The song was sung by Jack Jones the teenage son of Anne Jones the publican of the Glenrowan Inn (Victoria, Australia) while it was under siege by the Kelly Gang. The siege was broken by the Victorian Police on the morning of Monday June 28, 1880. Jack Jones died of injuries sustained during the police assault on the hotel. This song was cover-versioned by Japanese singer Suzuki Tsunekichi (Japanese: 鈴木常吉) in the title of \"Memories\" (Japanese: 思ひで), which was adapted as the opening theme song of Japanese TV drama \"Shinya Shokudō\"(Japanese: 深夜食堂).

Percy Grainger recorded an English language version on wax cylinder from Joseph Leaning of Lincolnshire in 1906, which has been digitised and can be heard online. In 1907, the Austrian ethnologist Rudolf Trebitsch used the same technology to record an Irish language version in County Kerry.

The folksinger and actor Suzuki Tsunekichi (Japanese: 鈴木常吉) used \"A Pretty Girl Milking a Cow\" as the basis for his song \"Omoide\" (Japanese: 思ひで), or \"Memories,\" pairing the traditional melody with new lyrics that evoke nostalgia, sorrow, and the transience of life. \"Omoide\" appears on Suzuki's 2006 album \"Zeigo\" (Japanese: ぜいご), and an excerpt from it was used as the opening theme for the TBS/Netflix television drama Shinya Shokudō (Japanese: 深夜食堂; known in English as \"Midnight Diner\"). The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). An adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 children's fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, it was primarily directed by Victor Fleming, who left production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind. It  stars Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, while others made uncredited contributions. The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart, with lyrics by Edgar \"Yip\" Harburg. The Wizard of Oz is celebrated for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters. It was a critical success and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning Best Original Song for \"Over the Rainbow\" and Best Original Score for Stothart; an Academy Juvenile Award was presented to Judy Garland. While the film was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit for MGM until its 1949 re-release, earning only $3 million on a $2.7 million budget, making it MGM's most expensive production at the time. The 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on CBS reintroduced the film to the public. According to the U.S. Library of Congress, it is the most seen film in movie history. In 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"; it is also one of the few films on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register. The film was ranked second in Variety's inaugural 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list published in 2022. It was among the top ten in the 2005 BFI (British Film Institute) list of \"50 films to be seen by the age of 14\" and is on the BFI's updated list of \"50 films to be seen by the age of 15\" released in May 2020. The Wizard of Oz has become the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary popular culture. The film frequently ranks on critics' lists of the greatest films of all time and is the most commercially successful adaptation of Baum's work.    Plot   In rural Kansas, Dorothy Gale lives on a farm owned by her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em. Dorothy's neighbor, Almira Gulch, who had been bitten by Dorothy's dog, Toto, obtains a sheriff's order authorizing her to seize Toto. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect him. Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune-teller, persuades Dorothy to go home because Aunt Em is heartbroken. She returns just as a tornado approaches the farm. Unable to get into the locked storm cellar, Dorothy takes cover in the farmhouse and is knocked unconscious as the tornado lifts the house and drops it intact onto an unknown land. Dorothy awakens and is greeted by a good witch named Glinda, who floats down in a bubble and explains that Dorothy has landed in Munchkinland in the Land of Oz, and that the Munchkins are celebrating because the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, suddenly appears. Before she can seize her deceased sister's ruby slippers, Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy's feet and tells her to keep them on. Because the Wicked Witch has no power in Munchkinland, she leaves, but swears vengeance upon Dorothy and Toto. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, the home of the Wizard of Oz, as he might know how to help her return home as the bubble makes her vanish and float away. Along the way, Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, who wants a brain; the Tin Man, who wants a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who wants courage. The group reaches the Emerald City, despite the efforts of the Wicked Witch. Dorothy is initially denied an audience with the Wizard by his guard, but the guard relents due to Dorothy's grief, and the four are led into the Wizard's chambers. The Wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broomstick. During their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch, but the ruby slippers protect her and Toto manages to escape, leading the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle. They free Dorothy, but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch and her guards. The Witch taunts them and sets fire to the Scarecrow's arm.

The date of Theodred's consecration unknown, but the date of his death was sometime between 995 and 997. The Judy Garland Show is an American musical variety television series that aired on CBS on Sunday nights during the 1963–1964 television season. Despite a sometimes stormy relationship with Judy Garland, CBS had found success with several television specials featuring the star. Garland, who for years had been reluctant to commit to a weekly series, saw the show as her best chance to pull herself out of severe financial difficulties. Despite it being cancelled relatively early on, it is now revered and considered an important piece of television history. Production difficulties beset the series almost from the beginning. The series had three different producers in the course of its 26 episodes and went through a number of other key personnel changes. With the change in producers also came changes to the show's format, which started as comedy and variety but switched to an almost purely concert format.  (In fact, as of episode 20, the on-screen title of the show became Judy Garland In Concert.) While Garland herself was popular with critics, the initial variety format and her co-star, Jerry Van Dyke, were not. The show competed with NBC's Bonanza, then the second most popular program on television, and consistently performed poorly in the ratings. Although fans rallied in an attempt to save the show, CBS cancelled it after a single season. TV Guide included the series in their 2013 list of 60 shows that were \"Cancelled Too Soon\".    Garland and CBS  Garland's history with CBS prior to the series was a checkered one. She had previously headlined several specials for the network. The first was the inaugural episode of the Ford Star Jubilee which aired in 1955. The special, the first full-scale color telecast on CBS, was a ratings triumph, garnering a 34.8 Nielsen rating. This success led to Garland's signing a three-year, $300,000 contract (equivalent to $3,412,174 in 2023) with the network. Only a single special aired, a live General Electric Theater episode in 1956, before the pact was terminated. The relationship between CBS and Garland and her then-husband and manager, Sid Luft, dissolved in acrimony in 1957, after they and agent Freddie Fields were unable to come to terms with the network over the format of her next special. Garland filed a US$1.4 million (equivalent to $15,187,678 in 2023) lawsuit against CBS for libel and breach of contract. (CBS filed a counterclaim) that was not settled until 1961, when Garland and CBS each agreed to drop their claims and negotiations began for a new round of Garland specials for the network. The first of two specials under this new relationship aired on February 25, 1962. The Judy Garland Show special, guest starring Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, was nominated for four Emmys. Its success led to CBS signing Garland in December 1962 for her weekly series, premiering in fall 1963. Garland's second special, Judy Garland and Her Guests Phil Silvers and Robert Goulet, was presented in March 1963. Alternately promoted as a preview and a pilot for Garland's upcoming regular series, this special was also nominated for an Emmy.    Production  Judy Garland's four-year contract for the series called for 26 weekly shows, for which Garland's corporation, Kingsrow Enterprises, would be paid $140,000 (equivalent to $1,393,304 in 2023) per episode. Of that, Garland was guaranteed between $25,000 and $30,000 (equivalent to $298,565 in 2023) per show. Kingsrow Enterprises would also retain ownership of the tapes, allowing Garland to sell the series into syndication. Although Garland had said as early as 1955 that she would never do a weekly television series, in the early 1960s she was in a financially precarious situation. Garland was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the IRS, having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952. The commercial disappointment of the film A Star is Born meant that her share of any profits from that film would be eaten up immediately. A successful run on television would secure Garland's financial future.    The George Schlatter episodes (episodes 1–5)  The Judy Garland Show was initially slated to be taped in New York City. The network initially offered the producer's job to Bob Banner, who was at the time producing a series for Garry Moore. Although he was interested, he declined to relocate from the West Coast. Bob Finkel, whose credits included shows for Dinah Shore and Andy Williams, was next approached but similarly refused to relocate. Veteran producer and director Bill Hobin, then heading up Sing Along with Mitch, was approached to produce and direct the program. Already based in the East, Hobin eagerly accepted. \" Pretty Girl\" is a song performed by American contemporary R&B singer Jon B, issued as the second single from his debut studio album\" Bonafide\". The song peaked at# 25 on the\" Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1995. Judy Garland (born Frances Ethel Gumm; June 10, 1922 – June 22, 1969) was an American actress, singer and dancer. During a career that spanned 45 years, she attained international stardom as an actress in both musical and dramatic roles, as a recording artist, and on the concert stage. Respected for her versatility, she received an Academy Juvenile Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Special Tony Award. In 1962, Garland won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for her 1961 double LP live recording \"Judy at Carnegie Hall\"—the first woman to win in this category. She is considered by many to be one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century. Garland began performing in vaudeville as a child with her two elder sisters and was later signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a teenager. She appeared in more than two dozen films for MGM, and is best remembered for her portrayal of Dorothy Gale in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Garland was a frequent on-screen partner of both Mickey Rooney and Gene Kelly and regularly collaborated with director and second husband Vincente Minnelli. Some of her film appearances during this period include roles in \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" (1944), \"The Harvey Girls\" (1946), \"Easter Parade\" (1948), and \"Summer Stock\" (1950). Garland was released from MGM in 1950, after 15 years with the studio, amid a series of personal struggles that prevented her from fulfilling the terms of her contract. Although her film career became intermittent thereafter, two of Garland's most critically acclaimed performances came late in her career: she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in \"A Star Is Born\" (1954) and a nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role in \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (1961). She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released eight studio albums, and hosted her own Emmy-nominated television series, \"The Judy Garland Show\" (1963–1964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and in 1999, the American Film Institute placed her among the 10 greatest female stars of classic American cinema. Garland struggled in her personal life from an early age. The pressures of early stardom affected her physical and mental health from her teens onward; her self-image was influenced and constantly criticized by film executives who believed that she was physically unattractive. Those same executives manipulated her onscreen physical appearance. Throughout her adulthood she was plagued by alcohol and substance abuse, as well as financial instability; she often owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. Her lifelong addiction to drugs, including alcohol, ultimately led to her death in London from an accidental barbiturate overdose at age 47.

At the age of 39, Garland became the youngest (and first female) recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the film industry. Throughout her career, Garland recorded and introduced numerous songs including \"Over the Rainbow\", which became her signature song, the Christmas classic \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" and the Saint Patrick's Day anthem \"It's a Great Day for the Irish\". She won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for her 1961 live recording, Judy at Carnegie Hall; she was the first woman to win that award. Garland struggled in her personal life from an early age.

Early life   Garland was born Frances Ethel Gumm on June 10, 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. She was the youngest child of Ethel Marion Gumm (née Milne; 1896–1953) and Francis \"Frank\" Avent Gumm (1886–1935). Her parents were vaudevillians who settled in Grand Rapids to run a movie theater that featured vaudeville acts. She was of Irish, English, Scottish, and French Huguenot ancestry, named after both of her parents and baptized at a local Episcopal church. \"Baby\" (as she was called by her parents and sisters) shared her family's flair for song and dance. Her first appearance came at the age of two, when she joined her elder sisters Mary Jane \"Suzy/Suzanne\" Gumm and Dorothy Virginia \"Jimmie\" Gumm on the stage of her father's movie theater during a Christmas show and sang a chorus of \"Jingle Bells\". The Gumm Sisters performed there for the next few years, accompanied by their mother on piano. The family relocated to Lancaster, California, in June 1926, following rumors that her father had homosexual inclinations. Frank bought and operated another theater in Lancaster, and Ethel began managing her daughters and working to get them into motion pictures.    Career     The Gumm/Garland Sisters   In 1928, the Gumm Sisters enrolled in a dance school run by Ethel Meglin, proprietor of the Meglin Kiddies dance troupe. They appeared with the troupe at its annual Christmas show. Through the Meglin Kiddies, they made their film debut in a short subject called The Big Revue (1929), where they performed a song-and-dance number called \"That's the Good Old Sunny South\". \" O Valencia!\" is the fifth single by the indie rock band The Decemberists, and the first released from their fourth studio album,\" The Crane Wife\". The music was written by The Decemberists and the lyrics by Colin Meloy. It tells a story of two star- crossed lovers. The singer falls in love with a person who belongs to an opposing gang. At the end of the song, the singer's lover jumps in to defend the singer, who is confronting his lover's brother( the singer's\" sworn enemy\") and is killed by the bullet intended for the singer. In a career that spanned more than forty years, Judy Garland performed on stage, screen and television. Garland appeared in 34 feature films. She was nominated for multiple Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards, receiving an Academy Juvenile Award and one Golden Globe. Her film career was interrupted in 1951 after she was cast in a series of films she was unable to complete, but she returned to the screen in 1954 in A Star Is Born and continued to appear in films until 1963.\nAlthough Garland appeared in concert as early as 1943, it was only when her film career stalled that she began regular concert appearances, beginning with a critically acclaimed 1951 concert series at the London Palladium. Garland set a record when she appeared for 19 weeks at the Palace Theatre in New York City, also in 1951, and her 1961 concert Judy at Carnegie Hall is often considered one of the greatest nights in show business history. She continued to tour until just three months prior to her death in 1969.\nGarland starred in a series of television specials beginning in 1955, when she appeared in the first episode of Ford Star Jubilee. The success of these specials led CBS to offer Garland a regular series. The Judy Garland Show premiered in 1963. Although the show was critically well-received, it suffered in the Nielsen ratings from being scheduled across from Bonanza, which was then the most popular show on the air. The Judy Garland Show was canceled after one season but Garland and the series were nominated for Emmy Awards.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Feature films ===\n\n\n=== Short subjects ===\n\n\n== Unfinished films ==\n\n\n== Box office ranking ==\nAt the height of her career, Garland was regularly ranked among the top movie stars in the US in the annual poll conducted by Quigley publishing:\n\n1940 – 10th\n1941 – 10th\n1942 – 19th\n1943 – 11th\n1944 – 14th\n1945 – 9th\n1946 – 25th\n1950 – 25th\n\n\n== Concerts ==\nGarland appeared in concert over 1,100 times.

At the beginning of his career his popularity quickly grew, causing networks like CBS to create and implement multiple television series specifically for his involvement and leading roles. After making a record number of appearances on top talk shows he was viewed by many as \"the face you see everywhere.\" In 1978, McNichol recorded an album with his sister, Kristy, also a child actress, and the two went on to host a youth-oriented variety show for ABC. McNichol subsequently had lead roles in Smokey Bites the Dust (1981), and opposite Susan Tyrrell in the horror film Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker (1981). After retiring from acting in the 1990s, McNichol relocated with his family to Colorado, and has been active in environmentalist causes, and working as a real estate investor and home renovator.    Biography     1961–1966: Early life  James Vincent McNichol III was born July 2, 1961 in Los Angeles, California, to James and Carolyn McNichol. He is of Lebanese and Irish descent. McNichol is the oldest of three siblings, with a sister Kristy (b. 1962) and brother Tommy (b. 1965). McNichol was raised by his single mother after the children's father, a carpenter, abandoned the family shortly after Tommy's birth. Their mother worked various odd jobs to support them, including as a secretary, cosmetics salesperson, and movie extra. Tommy was raised separately from him and Kristy, by his grandparents in Burbank.    1967–1991: Acting and music career   He began his career at age 7, acting in a Band-Aid commercial. He appeared in roughly 80 commercials from 1967 to 1973, including spots for Kool-Aid and Crest. He landed minor roles on shows such as Little House on the Prairie (1974) and S.W.A.T. (1975). His first film appearance was an uncredited role in Sunshine (1973) at the age of 12. His first regular starring role was as younger brother Jack on the network series The Fitzpatricks. Michele Tobin played his sister, Mo, on the show, and they later worked together on California Fever. McNichol sang the show's theme song and in 1978 recorded an album with his sister, Kristy and Jimmy McNichol, produced by Phil & Mitch Margo. The album spawned one hit single, a cover of The Chiffons' \"He's So Fine\", which charted at #70 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1978. The siblings also appeared as co-hosts of the fall 1978 ABC All-Star Saturday Preview Special, a youth-oriented sketch comedy show featuring musical guests such as the Bee Gees and Donny Osmond. McNichol and his sister, however, ceased performing together after Kristy had a manic breakdown while the two were in France; she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Afterward, McNichol stepped away from the music industry, later commenting: \"I know the outcome—it's a real big high one year, and the next year, nobody knows who you are. All that singing and touring and the guys behind you doing drugs. Eventually it's gonna get to you.\" When California Fever ended, he won the role as host of a weekly talk show, Hollywood Teen, as well as the Jimmy McNichol Special, which first aired in April 1980. He also starred in the television film Champions: A Love Story (1979), a teen drama about an ex-hockey player and figure skater who fall in love. He subsequently appeared in several other successful made-for-TV movies, including the thriller Blinded by the Light (1980), in which he starred opposite his sister Kristy as a gay teenager who escapes a religious cult. He also made several low-budget feature films, including Smokey Bites the Dust (1981) and the horror film Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker (1982), co-starring with Susan Tyrrell and Bill Paxton. In 1984, McNichol accepted the role of Josh Clayton on General Hospital. He performed in a band throughout the 1980s under the name \"Jimmy James\". His last major acting role was as Jill Ireland's son Valentine McCallum in the 1991 television film Reason for Living, co-starring Jill Clayburgh. After completing Reason for Living, at age 30, McNichol decided to retire from professional acting.    1992–present: Post-acting career  McNichol married his wife, Renée, in 1997. Susan Tyrrell (born Susan Jillian Creamer; March 18, 1945 – June 16, 2012) was an American character actress. Tyrrell's career began in theater in New York City in the 1960s in Broadway and off Broadway productions. Her first film was Shoot Out (1971). She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Oma in John Huston's Fat City (1972). In 1978, Tyrrell received the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Andy Warhol's Bad (1977). Her New York Times obituary described her as \"a whiskey-voiced character actress (with) talent for playing the downtrodden, outré, and grotesque.\"    Early life  Tyrrell was born in San Francisco, California, to a British mother, Gillian (née Tyrrell; 1913–2012), and an American father, John Belding Creamer. Her mother was a socialite and member of the diplomatic corps in China and the Philippines during the 1930s and 1940s. Her father John was an agent with the William Morris Agency who represented Leo Carrillo, Loretta Young, Ed Wynn, and Carole Lombard. Tyrrell spent her childhood in New Canaan, Connecticut. She was a poor student and as a teenager became estranged from her mother. Through her father's connections, Tyrrell was employed in the theatrical production of Time Out for Ginger (1963) starring Art Carney in New York City. Her father also persuaded Look magazine to follow her as she toured with the show, but he died shortly afterwards.    Career   Tyrrell made her Broadway debut in 1965 as a replacement performer in the comedy Cactus Flower. In 1968, as a member of the Repertory Theatre of Lincoln Center, she was in the cast of King Lear and revivals of The Time of Your Life (1969) and Camino Real (1970). Off-Broadway, Tyrrell appeared in the 1967 premiere of Lanford Wilson's The Rimers of Eldritch and a 1979 production of Father's Day (play) at The American Place Theatre. Tyrrell's television debut was in Mr. Novak (1964) and her film debut was in Shoot Out (1971). Tyrrell was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Oma in John Huston's Fat City (1972). In 1976, she played a psychotic character in I Never Promised You A Rose Garden. In 1978, she won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Bad. Later, Tyrrell starred as Queen Doris in the indie Forbidden Zone (1980). She sang the film's song, \"Witch's Egg\". A year later, she portrayed Vera in Tales of Ordinary Madness (1981). From 1981 to 1982, Tyrrell starred as Gretchen Feester, in the ABC's short-lived situation comedy series Open All Night. She then had a starring role in the exploitation horror film Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker (1981). In 1983, Tyrrell played Solly in the sexploitation film Angel and its 1984 sequel, Avenging Angel. Then followed roles in the adventure film Flesh+Blood, the Vincent Price anthology horror film From a Whisper to a Scream (1987), the animated feature film The Chipmunk Adventure (1987), and Big Top Pee-wee (the 1988 sequel to 1985's Pee-wee's Big Adventure). Tyrrell took a supporting role in John Waters' Cry-Baby (1990). In 1992, she guest starred on an episode of Wings  \"Marriage Italian Style\" and she performed her own one-woman show, Susan Tyrrell: My Rotten Life, a Bitter Operetta. In the late 1990s, Tyrrell had roles in the Tales from the Crypt episode \"Comes the Dawn\" (1995), the animated series Extreme Ghostbusters (1997), and the psychological thriller film Buddy Boy (1999). In the 2000s, Tyrrell appeared in Bob Dylan's Masked and Anonymous (2003) and The Devil's Due at Midnight (2004). Her final appearance was in the 2012 independent film Kid-Thing.    Personal life  Tyrrell moved to New York City in the early 1960s to focus on theater work, for the first time meeting and socializing with openly LGBT people. John Peter Berger ( BUR-jər; 5 November 1926 – 2 January 2017) was an English art critic, novelist, painter and poet. His novel G. won the 1972 Booker Prize, and his essay on art criticism Ways of Seeing, written as an accompaniment to the BBC series of the same name, was influential. He lived in France for over fifty years.    Early life  Berger was born on 5 November 1926 in Stoke Newington, London, the first of two children of Miriam and Stanley Berger. His grandfather was from Trieste, now Italy, and his father, Stanley, raised as a non-religious Jew who adopted Catholicism, had been an infantry officer on the Western Front during the First World War and was awarded the Military Cross and an OBE.  Berger was educated at St Edward's School, Oxford. He served in the British Army during the Second World War from 1944 to 1946. He enrolled at the Chelsea School of Art and the Central School of Art and Design in London.    Career  Berger began his career as a painter and exhibited works at a number of London galleries in the late 1940s. His art has been shown at the Wildenstein, Redfern and Leicester Galleries in London. Berger taught drawing at St Mary's teacher training college. He later became an art critic, publishing many essays and reviews in the New Statesman. His Marxist humanism and his strongly stated opinions on modern art combined to make him a controversial figure early in his career. As a statement of political commitment, he titled an early collection of essays Permanent Red. Berger was never a formal member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB): rather he was a close associate of it and its front, the Artists' International Association (AIA), until the latter disappeared in 1953. He was active in the Geneva Club, a discussion group that appears to have overlapped with British communist circles in the 1950s.    Publishing  In 1958, Berger published his first novel, A Painter of Our Time, which tells the story of the disappearance of Janos Lavin, a fictional exiled Hungarian painter, and his diary's discovery by an art critic friend called John. The work was withdrawn by the publisher under pressure from the Congress for Cultural Freedom a month after its publication. His next novels were The Foot of Clive and Corker's Freedom; both of which presented an urban English life of alienation and melancholy. Berger moved to Quincy in Mieussy in Haute-Savoie, France, in 1962 due to his distaste for life in Britain. In 1972, the BBC broadcast his four-part television series Ways of Seeing and published its accompanying text, a book of the same name. The first episode functions as an introduction to the study of images; it was derived in part from Walter Benjamin's essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\". The subsequent episodes concern the image of woman as a sexualized object in Western culture, expressions of property ownership and wealth in European oil painting, and modern advertising.  The series, the first of several close collaborations with director Mike Dibb, has had a lasting influence, and in particular introduced the concept of the male gaze, as part of his analysis of the treatment of the nude in European painting.  It soon became popular among feminists, including the British film critic Laura Mulvey, who used it to critique traditional media representations of the female character in cinema.  Berger's novel G., a picaresque romance set in Europe in 1898, won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Booker Prize in 1972. Berger donated half the Booker cash prize to the British Black Panthers, and retained the other half to support his work on the study on migrant workers, which became A Seventh Man; he asserted that both endeavors represented aspects of his political struggle. In his acceptance speech at the Booker Prize ceremony, Berger said the prize's sponsor, Booker McConnell, had a long history of slavery and exploitation in the Caribbean, and this was why he wanted to donate the money to the British Black Panthers and fund the writing of his book on migrant workers.[1] Berger's sociological writings include A Fortunate Man: The Story of a Country Doctor (1967) and A Seventh Man: Migrant Workers in Europe (1975).  Berger and photographer Jean Mohr, his frequent collaborator, sought to document and understand the experiences of peasants.  Their subsequent book, Another Way of Telling, discusses and illustrates their documentary technique and treats the theory of photography through Berger's essays and Mohr's photographs. William  Paxton (May 17, 1955 – February 25, 2017) was an American actor and filmmaker. He starred in films such as Aliens (1986), Near Dark (1987), Tombstone (1993), True Lies (1994), Apollo 13 (1995), Twister (1996), Titanic (1997), Mighty Joe Young (1998), and A Simple Plan (1998). He had supporting roles in Weird Science (1985), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and Nightcrawler (2014). Paxton starred in the HBO drama series Big Love (2006–2011), for which he earned three Golden Globe Award nominations during the show's run. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for portraying Randall McCoy in the History Channel miniseries Hatfields & McCoys (2012).    Early life   Bill Paxton was born in Fort Worth, Texas, on May 17, 1955, the son of Mary Lou (née Gray; 1926–2016) and John Lane Paxton (1920–2011). His mother was a Catholic who raised him and his siblings in her faith. His father was a businessman, lumber wholesaler, museum executive, and (during his son's career) an occasional actor, notably appearing in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films as Bernard Houseman and alongside Paxton in A Simple Plan (1998). His great-great-grandfather was Elisha Franklin Paxton (1828–1863), a brigadier general in the Confederate Army during the Civil War who was killed commanding the Stonewall Brigade at the Battle of Chancellorsville. Paxton is distantly related to actress Sara Paxton and was the great-nephew of Mary Paxton Keeley, a prominent journalist and close friend of Bess Truman. At the age of eight, he was in the crowd when President John F. Kennedy emerged from the Hotel Texas in Fort Worth on the morning of his assassination on November 22, 1963. Photographs of Paxton being lifted above the crowd are on display at the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. He later co-produced the film Parkland about the assassination. He graduated from Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth in 1973, after which he studied at Richmond College in London, alongside his old high-school friend Danny Martin. There, they met fellow Texas native Tom Huckabee, with whom they made Super 8 short films for which they built their own sets. One of Paxton's first lead roles was in Huckabee's experimental film Taking Tiger Mountain. Paxton subsequently moved to Los Angeles, where he worked in props and art departments and as a parking valet at the Beverly Hills Hotel. After being rejected by film schools in Southern California, he switched his ambitions from directing to acting.    Career     Acting and filmmaking   Among Paxton's earliest roles were as a mortuary assistant in Mortuary (1983), a minor role as a punk in The Terminator (1984), a minor role as a bartender in Streets of Fire, a supporting role as the lead protagonist's bullying older brother Chet Donnelly in John Hughes's Weird Science (1985), and Private William Hudson in Aliens (1986). He directed several short films, including the music video for Barnes & Barnes's novelty song \"Fish Heads\", which aired during Saturday Night Live's low-rated 1980–81 season and was in heavy rotation during the early days of Canadian music channel MuchMusic. He was cast in a music video for the 1982 Pat Benatar song \"Shadows of the Night\" in which he appeared as a Nazi radio officer. In 1981, Paxton worked in the movie Stripes as a soldier, in the bar scene with John Candy and Bill Murray. He worked alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in James Cameron's  The Terminator (1984) and in Commando (1985) and True Lies (1994). He reunited with Cameron on Aliens (1986). His performance in the latter film as Private Hudson earned him the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. He also appeared in Weird Science (1985). In 1987, Paxton played the most psychotic of the vampires, Severen, in Kathryn Bigelow's critically acclaimed neo-Western horror film, Near Dark.  In 1990, Paxton appeared in Predator 2 (1990). He collaborated with James Cameron again on True Lies (1994) and Titanic (1997), the latter of which was the highest-grossing film of all time at its release. In his other roles, Paxton played Morgan Earp in Tombstone (1993), Fred Haise in Apollo 13 (1995), Bill Harding in Twister (1996), and lead roles in dark dramas such as One False Move (1992) and A Simple Plan (1998). White Lightning and Other Favorites is a studio album released by George Jones on May 26, 1959. Its title track \"White Lightning\" was a #1 Country hit in 1959. The album is one of the most favorably regarded albums that Jones released in the 1950s. The album charted well, and was one of the most popular country albums of 1959. It also contained some of Jones' first collaborations. \"I'm With the Wrong One\" was his second collaboration, recorded in 1956 (the oldest song included on the LP) as a duet with Jennette Hicks. \"Flame in My Heart\" was his third collaboration, recorded as a duet with Virginia Spurlock and released as a single in 1957.    Composition and recording     Side one tracks  In 1957, Jones signed to Mercury Records and began recording with them in Nashville, leaving the old Starday studio in Houston. White Lightning and Other Favorites was released on May 28, 1959, as a two-sided 33rpm LP. Both sides listed a collaboration and both ended in a Southern-Gospel tune. The oldest song included on the album was recorded at one of his last recording sessions with Starday Records in August 1956 titled: \"I'm With the Wrong One,\" written by Jones.   White Lightning \"White Lightning\" was released in February 1959, and became a #1 hit written by a close-friend of Jones', who wrote a Top 10 for Jones the previous year. The Big Bopper wrote the song and included on his only LP release. Jones asked his manager, H.W. \"Pappy\" Daily, if he could record it, and requested that he give it to nobody else. Jones recorded the song in September 1958 at the Bradley Film and Recording Studio in Nashville. It was released as a single three days after Richardson (The Bopper) died in a plane crash. \"That's the Way I Feel\" was recorded in September 1957 and was written by Jones, like most of the tracks on the album. Jones would write or co-write 10 of the songs and all of Side 2. \"Life to Go\" was one of Jones best compositions, written after Jones played the Old Time Fiddlers Convention in Crockett, Texas, with Jackson and Ernest Tubb.  There was a prison there and, while walking around the grounds with Jackson, they began chatting with an inmate.  At one point  they asked him how much time he had left to serve, to which the prisoner replied, \"I been here for eighteen years and still got life to go.\"  \"His remark chilled me to the bone,\" Jones wrote in his 1996 autobiography I Lived To Tell It All.  \"I had hated the prison, but I knew I'd be leaving.  That man hated it more and knew he'd never leave.  I wanted to get that prison out of my mind.  But I couldn't.\" \"Don't Do This To Me\" was recorded on March 19, 1957, and written by Jones. \"Wandering Soul\" was recorded in September 1957 and was written by Bill Dudley and Jones.    Side two tracks  \"Giveaway Girl\" was written by Jones and Sid Kessel on March 19, 1957. \"You're Back Again\" was recorded and Jones and Hank Locklin, Locklin singing the backing-vocals for the track during an October 1956 session. \"No Use to Cry\" was recorded on April 23, 1957, and written by Jones. It was also included on his 1958 studio release: \"Long Live King George.\" \"Nothing Can Stop Me\" was released as the b-side to I'm With Wrong One in July 1958. It was written by Roger Miller and Jones and recorded on June 5, 1957. \"Flame in My Heart\" was recorded with fellow Mercury artists Virginia Spurlock on March 19, 1957. It was Jones third collaboration during his 50+ year career. \"Jesus Wants Me\" was the last song of the album and was a southern gospel song written by Jones with Eddie Noack, and was recorded on April 21, 1958. In his autobiography, Jones apologized to readers who might be disappointed that he had not provided more information in his book about his recording sessions because \"I've worked so many of them too drunk to walk but not too drunk to sing.  I can't remember much about them.\"  As he later explained to Billboard in 2006, \"I would say 90% of the time I would be in pretty damn good shape when I went into the studio. I did have a little sense, not a whole lot. But I would still have to have a little build-up of courage, three or four drinks throughout the session time. James Vincent McNichol III( born July 2, 1961), known professionally as Jimmy McNichol, is an American former child actor and singer who first gained fame as a teen idol in the late 1970s. At the beginning of his career his popularity quickly grew causing networks like CBS, to create and implement multiple television series specifically for his involvement and leading roles. After making a record number of appearances on top talk shows he was viewed by many as\" the face you see everywhere.\" In 1978, McNichol recorded an album with his sister, Kristy, also a former actress, and the two went on to host a youth- oriented variety show for ABC. McNichol subsequently had lead roles in\" Smokey Bites the Dust\"( 1981), and opposite Susan Tyrrell in the horror film\" Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker\"( 1981). After retiring from acting in the 1990s, McNichol relocated with his family to Colorado, and has been active in environmentalist causes, and working as a real estate investor and home renovator. Hole in My Heart may refer to: Julia Margaret Duffy (née Hinds; June 27, 1951) is an American actress.  From 1983 to 1990, she played Stephanie Vanderkellen in the TV series Newhart. The role garnered her critical acclaim, including seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations, three Viewers for Quality Television awards, and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film. Following the conclusion of Newhart, Duffy continued to work in television, playing the original Maggie Campbell on Baby Talk (1991) and Allison Sugarbaker on Designing Women (1991–1992). In the 2000s, Duffy appeared in guest roles on Reba and Drake & Josh, as well as having supporting roles in 2003's comedy films Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd and Intolerable Cruelty. She had recurring guest roles on the series Shameless (2011–2013) and Looking (2014–2015), and appeared in a supporting role in the drama Camp X-Ray (2014).    Early life, family, and education  Julia Margaret Hinds was born on June 27, 1951, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the youngest of four daughters of Joseph Hinds and Mary Duffy. When Julia was seven years old, her father died, and her mother later remarried and worked as a real estate agent. She began acting as an adolescent, appearing in local stage productions at Minneapolis's Old Log Theatre. At age 18, she appeared in a Minneapolis production of The Girl in the Freudian Slip. In 1970, Duffy moved to New York City, and she enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, from which she graduated in 1972. While attending, she worked as a waitress and hatcheck girl.    Career     Career beginnings  Duffy began her career in television, appearing in minor guest roles in soap operas such as Love of Life and One Life to Live before being cast in the role of Penny Davis in the series The Doctors from 1973 until 1977. In 1978, Duffy starred in the critically acclaimed Broadway revival of Once in a Lifetime. She appeared in supporting roles in the exploitation horror film Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker (1981), also known as Night Warning, as well as Cutter's Way (1981). She appeared in a first season episode of the television sitcom Cheers in 1982. Initially, she had been considered for the role of Diane Chambers, the sitcom's female lead. In 1983, she played Princess Ariel Baaldorf in the medieval adventure spoof TV series Wizards and Warriors, which lasted one season on the CBS network.    Newhart and critical acclaim  In 1982, Duffy guest-starred on the sitcom Newhart as Stephanie Vanderkellen, a self-obsessed heiress and the haughty cousin of Stratford Inn maid Leslie. At the beginning of the second season, Duffy joined the main cast, replacing Leslie as the Stratford's maid. She continued to play Stephanie for the rest of the show's run, earning Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the role every year from 1984 through 1990. She also received a Golden Globe nomination and won three Viewers For Quality Television awards and five American Comedy Awards nominations for her work.  Twice during Newhart's run, Duffy was pregnant. The first time, she wore baggy clothes and stood behind furniture to hide her bump, while the second time, the pregnancy was written into the show, with Stephanie becoming a mother in the eighth season. As of 2023, she remained in touch with Bob Newhart; he died in 2024.    After Newhart  After Newhart ended in 1990, Duffy briefly starred in the sitcom Baby Talk alongside George Clooney, but asked to be released after Clooney walked off the troubled set. The new producers accommodated her, allowing her to then join the cast of Designing Women in 1991. Baby Talk was then retooled and Duffy was replaced by Mary Page Keller. On Designing Women, she essentially replaced Delta Burke, the show's breakout star, who was fired after quarrels with producers. Duffy played Allison Sugarbaker, Burke and Dixie Carter's previously unseen cousin on the show. Duffy's tenure on the sitcom's sixth season turned out to be the highest-rated season in the show's history, partly because of the highly publicized cast additions of Duffy and Jan Hooks. However, because of conflicting ideas about her character, she was amicably released from her contract, thus leading her to be replaced by Judith Ivey. From 1993 to 1995, Duffy played Barb Ballantine on the short-lived comedy series The Mommies. Alain Tanner( born 6 December 1929) is a Swiss film director. == Early years and education ==\nTanner was born in Geneva, and studied economics at the University of Geneva. In 1951, he joined the film club which Claude Goretta had recently established at the university. After his graduation and a short time working for international shipping companies in London, he continued feeling drawn to film.\n\n\n== Film career ==\nTanner found work at the British Film Institute in 1955, subtitling, translating, and organizing the archive. His first film, Nice Time (1957), a short documentary film about Piccadilly Circus during weekend evenings, was made with Claude Goretta. Produced by the British Film Institute Experimental Film Fund, it was first shown as part of the third Free Cinema programme at the National Film Theatre in May 1957. The debut film won a prize at the film festival in Venice and much critical praise.\nTanner went to France for a while where he assisted with several commercial films. There, he met some of the most important directors of the French New Wave in Paris as well as Henri Langlois, the director of the Cinémathèque Française.

Dans la ville blanche, starring Bruno Ganz and shot in Lisbon, was entered into the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival.\nLight Years Away, his only English language film shot in Ireland, won the Grand Prix Prize at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nTanner and his wife, Janine, had two children.

The film has attracted critical discussion for its early positive portrayal of a gay male character.    Plot  High school senior Billy Lynch lives with his protective aunt Cheryl, who has raised him since infancy after his parents died in a car accident. A gifted basketball player, Billy is offered a chance at a scholarship to attend the University of Denver, but Cheryl dismisses the idea, assuming that Billy will stay with her to \"contribute\". At school, Billy is bullied by one of his basketball teammates, Eddie, who is jealous of Billy's close camaraderie with their coach, Tom Landers; meanwhile Julia, the school newspaper photographer, begins to take a romantic interest in Billy. On Billy's 17th birthday, Cheryl changes her mind about the scholarship, and asks Billy to stop by the television repair shop to have the shop technician, Phil Brody, come by to look at their set. That night, after Phil works on their television, Cheryl makes aggressive sexual advances toward him; when he refuses, Cheryl stabs him to death with a kitchen knife, which Billy witnesses through the window. Cheryl hysterically claims Phil tried to rape her. A bigoted police detective (and former Marine and Purple Heart recipient), Joe Carlson, is assigned to the case, and is skeptical of Cheryl and the alleged rape attempt. After discovering that Phil Brody was gay, and that he was in a same-sex relationship with Billy's coach, Tom, he assumes the murder to be the result of a love triangle between Phil, Tom, and Billy, and that Cheryl is covering for her nephew. Carlson begins questioning Billy, accusing him of being a \"fag\", and harasses Tom, forcing him to resign from his job at the high school. Carlson also inquires from Julia about her and Billy's sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Cheryl feeds Billy drugged milk, which causes him to perform poorly at his scholarship tryout, and cleans out the attic so he can have an apartment space in the house. Sergeant Cook, who has been casing Cheryl's home, believes Billy to be innocent, and is suspicious of Cheryl. After walking in on Billy and Julia having sex, Cheryl becomes enraged with Billy. In the attic, Billy finds a photo of a man named Chuck, whom Cheryl claims was one of his mother's old boyfriends. Billy has Julia stop by the house to distract Cheryl so that he can investigate further; locked in a box upstairs, he finds his birth certificate, indicating that Cheryl is actually his mother, and that Chuck was his father. Meanwhile, downstairs, Cheryl strikes Julia in the head with a meat tenderizer, and again drugs Billy with milk, rendering him unconscious. Julia awakens in a secret room in the basement, where she discovers Chuck's mummified corpse and his severed head in a jar of formaldehyde next to a makeshift shrine. Cheryl's nosy neighbor Margie, having grown suspicious, arrives shortly after to investigate the goings-on on the property, and is followed into the woods behind the house by Cheryl, who stabs her to death with a machete. Sergeant Cook then enters the house in search of Julia, who has been reported missing by her mother, and is also murdered by Cheryl after discovering Julia in the basement. Cheryl chases Julia out of the house, and they both fall in a pond near the woods, where Cheryl again knocks Julia unconscious. Billy awakens in the attic, which Cheryl has adorned with his childhood toys, and stumbles downstairs to call the police. Elizabeth Victoria Montgomery (April 15, 1933 – May 18, 1995) was an American actress whose career spanned five decades in film, stage, and television. She portrayed the good witch Samantha Stephens on the popular television series Bewitched, which earned her five Primetime Emmy Award nominations and four Golden Globe Award nominations. The daughter of actor, director and producer Robert Montgomery, she began her career in the 1950s with a role on her father's television series Robert Montgomery Presents, and she won a Theater World Award for her 1956 Broadway debut in the production Late Love. After Bewitched ended in 1972, Montgomery continued her career with roles in many television films, including A Case of Rape (1974) and The Legend of Lizzie Borden (1975), as Lizzie Borden. Both performances earned her additional Emmy Award nominations. Throughout her career, Montgomery was involved in various forms of political activism and charitable work.    Early life  Montgomery was born on April 15, 1933, in Los Angeles, California, to Broadway actress Elizabeth Daniel Bryan Allen and film star Robert Montgomery. Montgomery's mother was a native of Kentucky and her father was a native of New York. She had an elder sister, Martha Bryan Montgomery (named after her aunt Martha-Bryan Allen), who was born in 1931 and died in infancy, and a younger brother, Robert B. Montgomery Jr. Montgomery was of Irish and Scottish descent. Her great-grandfather, Archibald Montgomery, was born in Belfast and he emigrated to the United States in 1849. Genealogical research which was conducted after her death revealed that she and Lizzie Borden, acquitted of the murder of her father and stepmother in 1893, were sixth cousins once removed; both of them were descended from 17th-century Massachusetts resident John Luther. Montgomery portrayed Borden in the television film The Legend of Lizzie Borden (1975), unaware that Borden was her distant cousin. After attending the Westlake School for Girls in Holmby Hills, California, Montgomery graduated from the Spence School in New York City. She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan for three years.    Career     1951–1963: Early work   Montgomery made her television debut in her father's series Robert Montgomery Presents and on later occasions, she appeared as a member of his \"summer stock\" company of performers. In October 1953, Montgomery made her Broadway debut, starring in Late Love, for which she won a Theater World Award for her performance. She then made her film debut in Otto Preminger's The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell (1955). Montgomery returned to Broadway in 1956, appearing in The Loud Red Patrick. Montgomery's early career consisted of starring roles and appearances in live television dramas and series, such as Studio One, Kraft Television Theater, Johnny Staccato, Burke's Law, The Twilight Zone, The Eleventh Hour, Wagon Train, Boris Karloff's Thriller, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Montgomery was nominated at the 13th Primetime Emmy Awards for her portrayal of southern nightclub performer Rusty Heller in a 1960 episode of The Untouchables, playing opposite David White, who later portrayed Larry Tate on Bewitched. She played the part of Rose Cornelius in the Rawhide episode \"Incident at El Crucero\" (1963). Montgomery was featured in a role as a socialite who falls for a gangster (Henry Silva) in Johnny Cool (1963), directed by William Asher, and the film comedy Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed? (also 1963), with Dean Martin and Carol Burnett, this time directed by Daniel Mann. After her appearance on Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Alfred Hitchcock had her in mind to play the sister-in-law of Sean Connery, who sees herself as a rival to the troubled heroine in the film Marnie (1964), but Montgomery was unavailable.    1964–1972: Bewitched   In the ABC situation comedy Bewitched, Montgomery played the central role of lovable witch Samantha Stephens, with Dick York (and later with Dick Sargent) as her husband. Starting in the second season of the series, she also played the role of Samantha's mischievous cousin, Serena, under the pseudonym Pandora Spocks (a pun on Pandora's Box). Bewitched became a ratings success (it was, at the time, the highest-rated series ever for the network). The series aired for eight seasons, from 1964 to 1972, and Montgomery received five Emmy and four Golden Globe nominations for her role on Bewitched. Despite low ratings late in the series run, it was renewed for a ninth season to run from fall of 1972.

Asher's parents divorced when he was 11, resulting in a return to New York with his mother. He later recalled that this period of his life was filled with turmoil, because his mother was an abusive alcoholic. As a result of having to live in New York with his mother, he dropped out of school and, after working in the mailroom at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, he joined the Army in 1941. He served in the Army Signal Corps for four years, stationed in Astoria, Queens New York City as a unit photographer.    Career  Asher returned to California to direct Leather Gloves (1948), a low-budget film. He eventually gravitated to television (then a new medium), and gained a job writing short story \"fillers\" for various programs, which evolved into a series which was titled Little Theatre. From this work, he gained a contract with Columbia Pictures to work on a film musical for Harry Cohn. From CBS Studios, Asher received an offer to direct Our Miss Brooks, starring Eve Arden, a television version of the radio show. In 1952, Desi Arnaz asked Asher to direct an episode of his series I Love Lucy; by that show's end in 1957, Asher had directed 110 of the series' 179 episodes, Asher later commented that even though the creators knew the show was good, they did not believe it would become an American icon. \"When we did the show, we thought, 'That's it, we're done with it.' We never dreamed it would last this long. Lucille Ball, obviously, was one of TV's true pioneers.\" Asher was considered an \"early wunderkind of TV-land, blazing a path in the new medium\" of television. Writer and producer William Froug described Asher as a \"hyphenate of a different stripe, a director-producer\", commenting that he was one of many \"restless Hollywood professionals who, like nomads, drifted from job to job, always delivering competent, if not inspired work\". In addition to Our Miss Brooks and I Love Lucy, Asher directed episodes of The Colgate Comedy Hour, Make Room for Daddy, The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series), The Patty Duke Show, Gidget, The Dukes of Hazzard, and Alice. Asher and Montgomery befriended President John F. Kennedy, and, together with Frank Sinatra, planned Kennedy's 1961 inaugural ceremony. Asher's best-known work was Bewitched, which he directed regularly over its entire eight-year run, although he was only credited as producer for its last five seasons. At that time, he was married to the show's star Elizabeth Montgomery. They divorced soon after the series' cancellation in 1972. In 1986, he attempted to return to television, this time, with Fred Whitehead, Orion Television executive to set up Asher/Whitehead Productions, and the only TV project to came out was Kay O'Brien, which was canned after only one season on the air. Asher also directed a number of theatrical release films, including Beach Party, Muscle Beach Party, Bikini Beach, Beach Blanket Bingo, and How to Stuff a Wild Bikini, for all of which he was also a co-writer. Bewitched is an American fantasy sitcom television series that originally aired for eight seasons on ABC from September 17, 1964, to March 25, 1972.: 95  It is about a witch who marries an ordinary mortal man and vows to lead the life of a typical suburban housewife. The show was popular, finishing as the second-rated show in America during its debut season, staying in the top ten for its first three seasons, and ranking in eleventh place for both seasons four and five. The show continues to be seen throughout the world in syndication and on recorded media. Bewitched was created by Sol Saks under executive producer Harry Ackerman and starred Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha Stephens, Dick York (1964–1969) as Darrin Stephens, and Agnes Moorehead as Endora, Samantha's mother. Dick Sargent replaced an ailing York for the final three seasons, 1969–1972. Hanna-Barbera produced the opening and closing animation credits. In 2002, Bewitched was ranked No. 50 on \"TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time\". In 1997, the same magazine ranked the season two episode \"Divided He Falls\" No. 48 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\".    Plot  A beautiful witch named Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) meets and marries a mortal named Darrin Stephens (originally Dick York, later Dick Sargent). While Samantha complies with Darrin's wishes to become a normal suburban housewife, her magical family disapproves of the mixed marriage and frequently interferes in the couple's lives. Episodes often begin with Darrin becoming the victim of a spell, the effects of which wreak havoc with mortals such as his boss, clients, parents, and neighbors. By the epilogue, however, Darrin and Samantha most often embrace, having overcome the devious elements that failed to separate them. The witches and their male counterparts, warlocks, are very long-lived; while Samantha appears to be a young woman, many episodes suggest she is actually hundreds of years old. To keep their society secret, witches avoid showing their powers in front of mortals other than Darrin. Nevertheless, the effects of their spells—and Samantha's attempts to hide their supernatural origin from mortals—drive the plot of most episodes. Witches and warlocks usually use physical gestures along with their incantations. To perform magic, Samantha often twitches her nose to create a spell. Special visual effects are accompanied by music to highlight such an action.    Setting  The main setting for most episodes is the Stephenses' home at 1164 Morning Glory Circle, in an upper-middle-class suburban neighborhood, either in Westport, Connecticut, or Patterson, New York, as indicated by conflicting information presented throughout the series. Many scenes also take place at the fictional Madison Avenue advertising agency McMann and Tate, where Darrin works.

Situated in the southwest of the country, where the Rhône exits Lake Geneva, it is the capital of the Republic and Canton of Geneva, and a centre for international diplomacy. Geneva hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world. The city of Geneva (Ville de Genève) had a population of 203,856 in January 2021 within its municipal territory of 16 km2 (6 sq mi), but the larger Canton of Geneva had a population of 506,343  over 246 km2 (95 sq mi). The Geneva metropolitan area as officially defined by Eurostat, including suburbs and exurbs in Vaud and the French departments of Ain and Haute-Savoie, extends over 2,292 km2 (885 sq mi) and had a population of 1,053,436 in 2021. Since 2013, the Canton of Geneva, the Nyon District (in the canton of Vaud), and the Pôle métropolitain du Genevois français (lit. 'Metropolitan hub of the French Genevan territory', a federation of eight French intercommunal councils), have formed Grand Genève (\"Greater Geneva\"), a Local Grouping of Transnational Cooperation (GLCT in French, a public entity under Swiss law) in charge of organizing cooperation within the cross-border metropolitan area of Geneva (in particular metropolitan transports). The Grand Genève GLCT extends over 1,996 km2 (771 sq mi) and had a population of 1,046,168 in Jan. 2021 (Swiss estimates and French census), 58.3% of them living on Swiss territory, and 41.7% on French territory. Geneva is a global city, a financial centre, and a worldwide centre for diplomacy due to the presence of numerous international organizations, including the headquarters of many agencies of the United Nations and the ICRC and IFRC of the Red Cross. In the aftermath of World War I, it hosted the League of Nations. It was where the Geneva Conventions on humanitarian treatment in war were signed. It shares a unique distinction with municipalities such as New York City (global headquarters of the UN), Basel (Bank for International Settlements), and Strasbourg (Council of Europe) as a city which serves as the headquarters of at least one critical international organization without being the capital of a country. The city has been referred to as the world's most compact metropolis and the \"Peace Capital\". In 2023, Geneva was ranked as the world's tenth most important financial centre by the Global Financial Centres Index, second in Europe behind London. In 2019, Geneva was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by Mercer, alongside Zürich and Basel, as well as the thirteenth most expensive city in the world. In a UBS ranking of global cities in 2018, Geneva was ranked first for gross earnings, second most expensive, and fourth in purchasing power.    Name  The city was mentioned in Latin texts, by Caesar, with the spelling Genava, probably from the Celtic *genawa- from the stem *genu- (\"mouth\"), in the sense of an estuary, an etymology shared with the Italian port city of Genoa (in Italian Genova). The medieval county of Geneva in Middle Latin was known as pagus major Genevensis or Comitatus Genevensis (also Gebennensis). After 1400 it became the Genevois province of Savoy (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the reformation of the seat of the Bishop of Geneva).    History   Geneva was an Allobrogian border town, fortified against the Helvetii tribe, when the Roman Republic took it in 121 BC. It became Christian under the Late Roman Empire, and acquired its first bishop in the 5th century, having been connected to the Bishopric of Vienne in the 4th.  In the Middle Ages, Geneva was ruled by a count under the Holy Roman Empire until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance. Around this time, the House of Savoy came to at least nominally dominate the city. In the 15th century, an oligarchic republican government emerged with the creation of the Grand Council.

It is based on two German legends: Tannhäuser, the mythologized medieval German Minnesänger and poet, and the tale of the Wartburg Song Contest. The story centres on the struggle between sacred and profane love, as well as redemption through love, a theme running through most of Wagner's work. The opera remains a staple of major opera house repertoire in the 21st century.    Composition history     Sources   The libretto of Tannhäuser combines mythological elements characteristic of German Romantische Oper (Romantic opera) and the medieval setting typical of many French Grand Operas. Wagner brings these two together by constructing a plot involving the 14th-century Minnesänger and the myth of Venus and her subterranean realm of Venusberg. Both the historical and the mythological are united in Tannhäuser's personality; although he is a historical poet composer, little is known about him other than myths that surround him. Wagner wove a variety of sources into the opera narrative. According to his autobiography, he was inspired by finding the story in \"a Volksbuch (popular book) about the Venusberg\", which he said \"fell into his hands\", although he admits knowing of the story from the Phantasus of Ludwig Tieck and E. T. A. Hoffmann's story, Der Kampf der Sänger (The Singers' Contest). Tieck's tale, which names the hero \"Tannenhäuser\", tells of the minnesinger-knight's amorous adventures in the Venusberg, his travels to Rome as a Pilgrim, and his repudiation by the pope. To this Wagner added material from Hoffmann's story, from Serapions-Brüder (1819), describing a song contest at the Wartburg castle, a castle which featured prominently in Thuringian history. Heinrich Heine had provided Wagner with the inspiration for Der fliegende Holländer and Wagner again drew on Heine for Tannhäuser. In Heine's sardonic essay \"Elementargeister\" (Elemental spirits), there appears a poem about Tannhäuser and the lure of the grotto of Venus, published in 1837 in the third volume of Der Salon. Other possible sources include Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué's play Der Sängerkrieg auf der Wartburg and Eichendorff's Das Marmorbild (The Marble Statue, 1818). The legend of Tannhäuser, the amorous crusading Franconian knight, and that of the song contest on the Wartburg (which did not involve Tannhäuser, but the semi-mythical minnesinger Heinrich von Ofterdingen), came from quite separate traditions. Ludwig Bechstein wove together the two legends in the first volume of his collection of Thuringian legends, Der Sagenschatz und die Sagenkreise des Thüringerlandes (A treasury of the tales of Thuringian legends and legend cycles, 1835), which was probably the Volksbuch to which Wagner refers in his autobiography. Wagner also knew of the work of another contemporary, Christian Theodor Ludwig Lucas, whose Über den Krieg von Wartburg of 1838 also conflated the two legends. This confusion (which explains why Tannhäuser is referred to as 'Heinrich' in the opera) does not fit with the historical timeline of the events in the opera, since the Singers' Contest involving von Ofterdingen is said to have taken place around 1207, while Tannhäuser's poetry appeared much later (1245–1265). The sources used by Wagner therefore reflected a nineteenth century romantic view of the medieval period, with concerns about artistic freedom and the constraints of organised religion typical of the period of Romanticism. During Wagner's first stay in Paris (1839–1842) he read a paper by Ludwig Lucas on the Sängerkrieg which sparked his imagination, and encouraged him to return to Germany, which he reached on 7 April 1842. Having crossed the Rhine, the Wagners drove towards Thuringia, and saw the early rays of sun striking the Wartburg; Wagner immediately began to sketch the scenery that would become the stage sets.

Though all six are non-human animals, Pluto alone is not dressed as a human. Pluto debuted in animated cartoons and appeared in 24 Mickey Mouse films before receiving his own series in 1937. All together Pluto appeared in 89 short films between 1930 and 1953. Several of these were nominated for an Academy Award, including The Pointer (1939), Squatter's Rights (1946), Pluto's Blue Note (1947), and Mickey and the Seal (1948). One film starring him, Lend a Paw (1941), won the award in 1942. Because Pluto does not speak, his films generally rely on physical humor. This made Pluto a pioneering figure in character animation, by expressing personality through animation rather than dialogue. Like all of Pluto's co-stars, the dog has appeared extensively in comics over the years, first making an appearance in 1931. He returned to theatrical animation in 1990 with The Prince and the Pauper and has also appeared in several direct-to-video films. Pluto also appears in the television series Mickey Mouse Works (1999–2000), House of Mouse (2001–2003), Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006–2016), Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures (2017–2021), Mickey Mouse (2013–2019) and its successor The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse (2020–2023), and Mickey Mouse Funhouse (2021–present). In 1998, Disney's copyright on Pluto, set to expire in 2003, was extended by the passage of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. Disney, along with other studios, lobbied for passage of the act to preserve their copyrights on characters such as Pluto for 20 additional years.    Origin  Pluto first appeared as a nameless bloodhound tracking the escaped convict Mickey in the film The Chain Gang, which released on August 6, 1930. On October 23 of that same year, The Picnic was released. Pluto was Minnie's dog and was named Rover. The Moose Hunt, which came out on May 3, 1931, Pluto appeared as Mickey's pet, and was given the name \"Pluto\". Several months had passed between the naming of what was then classified as the ninth planet, Pluto, on May 1, 1930, and the attachment of that name to the dog character.  Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen said \"We thought the name [Rover] was too common, so we had to look for something else. ... We changed it to Pluto the Pup ... but I don't honestly remember why.\" Some Disney animators reportedly believed that Walt Disney chose the name to capitalize on the sensation of the newly named planet. Pluto was initially a minor character until 1934 when Disney animator Norm Ferguson gave the dog a key role in the cartoon Playful Pluto. Pluto becomes entangled with a sticky piece of flypaper, and Ferguson expanded the sequence significantly. The segment became a classic, demonstrating how Disney artists can take a simple circumstance and build humor through a character.    Characterization  Unlike Mickey's other animal friends, such as Goofy (who is also a dog), Pluto is a relatively normal animal, with few anthropomorphic traits apart from his facial expressions. Pluto usually doesn't speak in English, walk upright or wear clothing. A significant departure from this was his speaking role in The Moose Hunt (1931), which was produced before Pluto's characterization had been clearly defined. As Pluto made more appearances, it became common that he would mostly speak in barks and grunts like most dogs. Other ways of communicating Pluto's thoughts occur through his facial expressions, and sometimes through the use of a shoulder angel/devil who speak directly to Pluto. (Mickey's Elephant, Lend a Paw). Pluto is generally a cheerful and adventurous dog, although he can be given to sheer panic when confronted with something unknown. Common themes in Pluto's stories involve him becoming jealous of Mickey getting another pet (Mickey's Elephant, Lend a Paw, Mickey and the Seal), Pluto accidentally and unwittingly swallowing something and panicking when he realizes it (Playful Pluto, Donald and Pluto), Pluto getting entangled with something inanimate like a piece of flypaper (Beach Picnic, Playful Pluto), or Pluto being pestered by a smaller animal (Private Pluto, Squatter's Rights). Sydney Hughes Greenstreet (December 27, 1879 – January 18, 1954) was a British and American actor. While he did not begin his career in films until the age of 61, he had a run of significant motion pictures in a Hollywood career lasting through the 1940s. He is best remembered for the three Warner Bros. films - The Maltese Falcon (1941), Casablanca (1942), and Passage to Marseille (1944) - with both Humphrey Bogart (5 films total with Greenstreet) and Peter Lorre (9 films with Greenstreet, 3 of which were also with Bogart). He portrayed Nero Wolfe on radio during 1950 and 1951. He became an American citizen in 1925.    Early life  Sydney Hughes Greenstreet was born on December 27, 1879, in Eastry, Kent, the son of Ann (née Baker) and John Jarvis Greenstreet, a tanner. He had seven siblings. He left home at the age of 18 to make his fortune as a Ceylon tea planter, but drought forced him out of business. He began managing a brewery and, to escape boredom, took acting lessons.    Career  Greenstreet's stage debut was as a murderer in a 1902 production of a Sherlock Holmes story at the Marina Theatre, Ramsgate, Kent. He toured Britain with Ben Greet's Shakespearean company, and in 1905 made his New York City debut in Everyman. He appeared in such plays as a revival of As You Like It (1914). He appeared in numerous plays in Britain and America, working through most of the 1930s with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne at the Theatre Guild. His stage roles ranged from musical comedy to Shakespeare, and years of such versatile acting on two continents led to many offers to appear in films. He refused until he was 61.  In 1941, Greenstreet began working for Warner Bros. His debut film role was as Kasper Gutman (\"The Fat Man\") co-starring with Humphrey Bogart in The Maltese Falcon. In Casablanca (1942), Greenstreet played crooked club owner Signor Ferrari (for which he received a salary of $3,750 per week—equivalent to $60,179.91 in 2020 dollars—for seven weeks' work). He also appeared in Background to Danger (1943), with George Raft; Passage to Marseille (1944), reuniting with Casablanca stars Bogart, Peter Lorre and Claude Rains; The Mask of Dimitrios (1944); The Conspirators (1944) with Hedy Lamarr and Paul Henreid; Hollywood Canteen (1944); Conflict (1945), again with Bogart; Three Strangers (1946); and The Verdict (1946). In the last two, and The Mask of Dimitrios, he received top billing. He had dramatic roles, such as William Makepeace Thackeray in Devotion (1946), and witty performances in screwball comedies, such as Alexander Yardley in Christmas in Connecticut (1944). Near the end of his film career, he played opposite Joan Crawford in Flamingo Road (1949). After little more than eight years, Greenstreet's film career ended with Malaya (also 1949), in which he was billed fourth, after Spencer Tracy, James Stewart and Valentina Cortese. In those years, he worked with stars ranging from Clark Gable to Ava Gardner to Joan Crawford. Author Tennessee Williams wrote his one-act play The Last of My Solid Gold Watches with Greenstreet in mind, and dedicated it to him. During 1950–1951, Greenstreet played Nero Wolfe on the radio program The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe, based loosely on the rotund detective genius created by Rex Stout.    Death and legacy  Greenstreet suffered from diabetes and Bright's disease, a kidney disorder. Five years after retiring from film acting, he died on January 18, 1954, in Hollywood. His death was caused by complications from both conditions. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California, in the Utility Columbarium area of the Great Mausoleum, inaccessible to the public. He was survived by his only child, John Ogden Greenstreet (1920–2004), from his marriage to Dorothy Marie Ogden. Actor Mark Greenstreet is his great-nephew. His other relatives who are still living include Gregory Greenstreet and his children, Tamar Greenstreet and Elan Greenstreet.

The film's script—from Two's a Crowd, an original screenplay by Garson Kanin (uncredited)—was written by Robert Russell, Frank Ross, Richard Flournoy, and Lewis R. Foster. Set in Washington, D.C., the film presents a comic look at the housing shortage during World War II. The film received six nominations at the 16th Academy Awards, among them Best Picture, Best Director for Stevens, Best Actress for Arthur, Best Writing (Original Motion Picture Story), and Best Writing (Screenplay). Coburn won Best Supporting Actor. The film was remade in 1966 as Walk, Don't Run starring Cary Grant, Samantha Eggar, and Jim Hutton. The setting was changed to Tokyo, which had experienced housing shortages due to the 1964 Summer Olympics.    Plot  Retired millionaire Benjamin Dingle arrives in Washington, D.C., as an adviser on the housing shortage, and finds that his hotel suite will not be available for two days. He sees a classified ad for a roommate and talks the reluctant young woman, Connie Milligan, into letting him sublet half of her apartment. The next morning, after Connie leaves for work, Dingle meets Sergeant Joe Carter, who is interested in a room to stay for a week while waiting to be shipped overseas. Recognizing Joe as a suitable young man for Connie, Dingle rents him half of his half. When Connie discovers the new arrangement, she angrily orders both men to leave, but is forced to relent because she has already spent the pair's rent. Joe and Connie soon develop a mutual attraction, though she is engaged to pompous bureaucrat Charles J. Pendergast. Connie's mother married for love, not security, and Connie is determined not to repeat that mistake. Dingle meets Pendergast by chance at a business luncheon the following day and decides that Joe would be a better match for Connie.  One day, Dingle reads aloud to Joe from Connie's diary, including her thoughts about Joe. Dingle is caught by Connie, who demands they both leave the next day. Dingle takes full blame for the incident, and retreats to his now-available hotel room. Joe gives Connie a traveling bag as an apology gift, and she allows him to stay until he departs for Africa in two days. Joe asks Connie out to dinner that night; she is initially reluctant but decides she will accept his invitation if Pendergast does not call her by 8:00. At 8:00, Joe and Connie prepare to leave, but her nosy teenage neighbor seeks her advice and delays her until Pendergast arrives downstairs. As Connie and Pendergast leave together, Joe spies on the couple from his window with binoculars. When the neighbor asks what he is doing, Joe flippantly tells him he is a Japanese spy. Dingle calls Joe to meet him for dinner at a restaurant, where they run into Connie and Pendergast. Playing Cupid, Dingle invites Pendergast to his suite to discuss the housing shortage, so that Joe and Connie can be alone together. Later, Joe walks Connie home. The two share their romantic pasts and end up kissing on the front steps. Inside, a sleepless Joe confesses through his bedroom wall that he loves her. She tells him she feels the same way, but refuses to marry him, as they will soon be forced apart when he leaves for Africa. Joe and Connie are interrupted by the arrival of two brusque FBI agents, who have been tipped off that Joe is a Japanese spy. Joe and Connie are taken to FBI headquarters. They assert that Dingle can vouch for Joe's identity and innocence. Dingle arrives, bringing Pendergast. During questioning, Pendergast is shocked to learn that Joe and Connie share the same address. When they ask Dingle to tell Pendergast that their living arrangement is purely innocent, he denies knowing them. Outside the station, Dingle says he lied to protect his reputation. Taking a taxi home, they all discuss what to do to avoid a scandal. Connie grows angry when Pendergast only cares about his career and returns his ring. When another passenger in the shared cab turns out to be a reporter, Pendergast runs after him to try to stop him from writing about his fiancée cohabiting with Joe. Dingle assures Connie that if she marries Joe, the crisis will be averted, and they can file for a quick annulment afterwards. With 26 hours until Joe leaves for Africa, they follow his advice and fly to South Carolina to wed, where a license can be more quickly obtained than in D.C. Returning home, Connie allows Joe to spend his final night in her apartment.

Early life and education  Kim Eui-sung is a graduate of Seoul National University's Department of Business Administration, Class of 1984. Kim began acting in college by joining the drama club in his sophomore year. His inspiration came from watching a school play and attending an after-party. He performed two-person plays with his senior, Jung Jin-young, traveling across the country. From 1987, he was active in various theater companies such as Cheonjeyeon, Han River, Hanyang Repertory, Yeonwoo Stage, and Hakchon.    Career     Early career  Kim made his screen debut in 1988. In 1994, he played the role of photographer Jang Ik-gu in Kim Soo-hyun's work, \"Farewell.\" He began to gain attention after appearing in director Hong Sang-soo's 1996 film The Day a Pig Fell into the Well. He also appeared in various films and dramas, including Go Alone Like a Rhinoceros, Deep Water Soup, Barricade, and Ju No Myeong Bakery.    Acting hiatus and production work  He paused his acting career for more than a decade to work as a producer, serving as the CEO for Vietnam at FnC Media in 2001 and CJ Media in 2006. He stepped away from acting due to dissatisfaction with his performances. While in Vietnam, he produced a successful local drama, but his tendency of prioritizing the work over profit led to financial struggles and long efforts to save money.

The Government of Australia initiated the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme in 1945, and the Government of New Zealand initiated a similar scheme in 1947. The Australian government arranged for assisted passage to Australia on chartered ships and aircraft. The migrants were called Ten Pound Poms due to the charge of £10 in processing fees to migrate to Australia.    Assisted Passage Migration Scheme  The Assisted Passage Migration Scheme was created in 1945 by the Chifley government and its first Minister for Immigration, Arthur Calwell, as part of the \"Populate or Perish\" policy. It was intended to substantially increase the population of Australia and to supply workers for the country's booming industries. In return for subsidising the cost of travelling to Australia, the Government promised employment prospects, affordable housing, and a generally more optimistic lifestyle. But upon arrival, migrants were placed in basic migration hostels and the expected job opportunities were not always readily available.  Adult migrants were charged only ten pounds sterling for the fare (hence the name; in 1945 pounds, equivalent to £545 in 2023), and migrant scheme children travelled free of charge. It was a follow-on to the unofficial Big Brother Movement and attracted more than a million migrants from the British Isles between 1945 and 1972. It was the last substantial scheme for preferential migration from the British Isles to Australia. In 1957 more migrants were encouraged to travel following a campaign called \"Bring out a Briton\". The scheme reached its peak in 1969, when more than 80,000 migrants took advantage of the scheme. In 1973 the cost to migrants of the assisted passage was increased to £75 (equivalent to £1,146 in 2023). The scheme was ended in 1982. While the term \"Ten Pound Pom\" is in common use, the scheme was not limited to migrants from the United Kingdom. People born in the Irish Free State or in the southern counties of Ireland before the establishment of the Republic of Ireland in 1949 were also classified as British subjects. In fact most British subjects were eligible and, at the time, that included not only those from the British Isles but also residents of British colonies such as Malta and Cyprus. Australia also operated schemes to assist selected migrants from other countries, notably the Netherlands (1951), Italy (1951), Greece (1952), West Germany (1952) and Turkey (1967). Assisted migrants were generally required to remain in Australia for two years after arrival, or alternatively refund the cost of their assisted passage. If they chose to travel back to Britain, the cost of the journey was at least £120 (in 1945 pounds, equivalent to £6,541 in 2023), a large sum in those days and one that most could not afford. It was also possible for many British people to migrate to Australia on a non-assisted basis before the early 1970s, although most travelled as Ten Pounders. This was part of the wider White Australia policy. An estimated quarter of British migrants returned to the UK within the qualifying period; however, half of these—the so-called \"Boomerang Poms\"—returned to Australia. Before 1 December 1973, migrants to Australia from Commonwealth countries were eligible to apply for Australian citizenship after one year's residence in Australia. In 1973 the residence requirement was extended to three years, the requirements being place of residence, good character, knowledge of the language, and rights and duties of citizenship and the intention to live permanently in Australia. In November 1984 the residence requirement was reduced to two years. However, relatively few British migrants—compared to other post-war arrivals, such as Turks—took up Australian citizenship. Consequently, many may have lost their Australian residency status later on, usually through leaving Australia.    New Zealand scheme  The Government of New Zealand initiated a similar immigration scheme in July 1947. The first immigrants arrived on the RMS Rangitata later that year. The scheme was administered by the Department of Labour under the guidance of Bert Bockett, and was expanded to include the Netherlands in 1950. The Dutch immigration scheme finished in 1963, with just over 6,000 immigrants to New Zealand; with Bockett receiving the Olivier van Noort medallion from the Dutch government in the following year. The British immigration scheme lasted until 1971, with 76,673 immigrants. From 1957 to 1971, the scheme applied to further European countries, with a total of 1,442 immigrants.    Well-known participants  Prime Minister Julia Gillard migrated with her family from Barry, Glamorgan, Wales, in 1966, aged four. Kim Sung-su (born November 15, 1961) is a South Korean film director, known mainly for the teen film \"Beat\", period epic \"Musa\" and the comedy \"Please Teach Me English\". == Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Feature films ===\n\n\n=== Short films ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations == Kim Il Sung University (Korean: 김일성종합대학) is a public university in Taesong, Pyongyang, North Korea. Founded on 1 October 1946, it is the first institution of higher learning in North Korea since its foundation. The 15-hectare campus, along with the main academic buildings, contains 10 separate offices, 50 laboratories, libraries, museums, a printing press, an R&D center, dormitories, and a hospital. There is a large computer lab, but it has limited internet access. The university is named in honour of Kim Il Sung, the founding leader of North Korea. Kim Il Sung University enrolls around 16,000 students, and provides courses in the fields of law, economics, humanities, and natural sciences. In the spring of 2017, Kim Il Sung University set up specialist Japanese language and literature courses. Undergraduate courses take between four and a half and five years for completion. The university also operates a graduate school for doctoral students.    History   On 25 May 1946 the Preparatory Committee was composed by the founding universities. In July 1946, the interim People's Committee of North Korea decided to establish a university (ordinance No. 40). In 1948, four university faculties (Faculty of Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Medicine) were separated from Kim Il Sung University, to form Pyongyang University of Technology (currently Kim Chaek University of Technology), Wonsan University of Agriculture, Pyongyang Medical College, and the Pyongyang University of Architecture. During the Korean War, the university was located at Baeksong-ri under Mount Jamo in Suncheon-gun, which was far from the centre of the city. By late 1955, the reconstruction of the main building on the Pyongyang campus was in progress and soon the university moved back to the centre of Pyongyang. After the war, Kim Il-Sung University became known as a hotbed of intellectual dissent. Academics supported more intellectual freedoms than Kim loyalists, and disadvantageous factions within the Workers' Party of Korea were over-represented in university staff. Following the Revolutions of 1956 in Hungary and in Poland, North Korean exchange students were quickly repatriated from the affected countries. The students started asking \"improper\" questions on campus, causing alarm. After that, up to one hundred students and several prominent staff members were purged. The purging of the university gave further impetus to purges against functionalists all over the country. By the end of 1970s more than 50,000 students graduated from the university. In addition, the university was an important asset for the Korean People's Army to train its personnel. Since the 1970s, English courses have been taught at the university. Until 2004, Pak Kwan-o, an authority on nuclear physics and current Chairman of the People's Committee of Pyongyang (synonymous with mayor), had been serving as the president for 17 years. According to the university's website, the current president is Kim Sung Chan since 2021. In May 2010, Pyongyang Medical College, Sariwon Kye Ung Sang Agricultural College and Pyongyang Agricultural College became members of the Kim Il Sung University Council, however, those three institutions were later removed in October 2019. According to Korean Central Television, North Korean students can take classes at and download lectures from Kim Il Sung University via the Mirae WiFi network, beginning in 2018.    International students  Kim Il Sung University first began admitting international students in 1995; as of 2019, about 5000 international students from 30 countries have studied at the university. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were estimated to be about 100 foreign students at Kim Il-Sung University, the majority of whom were Chinese. International students at Kim Il-Sung University live alongside specially trained and vetted local students called tongsuksaeng, who are there to act as hosts and to teach the Korean language and culture. Musa (lit. \"Warrior\"), released as both \"The Warrior\" and \"The Ultimate Warrior\" in English-speaking countries, is a 2001 South Korean epic action drama film directed by Kim Sung-su, starring Jung Woo-sung, Ahn Sung-ki, Joo Jin-mo and Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi. The semi-historical story follows the adventures of a Korean peace delegation as they try to get back to Korea through the inhospitable deserts of northern China. The film is regarded as being one of the biggest motion pictures in the history of South Korean cinema. At the time of its production its budget was the largest ever for a Korean film. It features a high degree of historical accuracy in period costumery, props, settings, and most unusually, language; that is, everyone speaks in their native tongues or through an interpreter conversant in a lingua franca. The film was the 8th highest grossing film of 2001 with over two million tickets sold.

Plot  In 1375, a small diplomatic mission from the Korean kingdom Goryeo travels to Ming China to meet the Hongwu Emperor, but they are arrested in retaliation for the death of a Chinese diplomat in Goryeo. They are put in chains and taken across a desert. However, Mongol raiders suddenly show up and kill the Chinese soldiers transporting them, while killing some Koreans in the process. The Mongols ride off, leaving the rest of the Koreans to die of hunger or thirst. The head of the Korean soldiers in the group, General Choi-Jung, takes command because the two diplomats are dead. Later, they discover that the Mongols have kidnapped the Hongwu Emperor's daughter so they ambush the Mongol convoy and rescue the princess. Yeo-sol, a former slave of one of the diplomats, defeats the Mongol general Rambulwha in single combat, but allows the latter to live and escape. The Koreans flee with the princess, determined to return her safely to the Chinese capital, Nanjing, to atone for their diplomatic failure. The Mongols give chase in the hope of recovering the princess and presenting her to their Khan while the Koreans head towards a coastal fortress the princess tells them about, where they expect to find safe haven. Along the way, the Koreans pick up some Chinese peasants who are also fleeing from the Mongols. Fighting their way through Mongol search parties, the group experiences many internal conflicts stemming from social class, love, and honour. The lower-class soldiers chafe under their poor treatment in comparison to the soldiers of the upper-class. They have little confidence in their young general, and prefer taking orders from their veteran sergeant, Dae-Jung. The princess has difficulty adjusting to the rough necessities of her position on the run. Choi-Jung and Yeo-sol become nemeses, competing for the affections of the princess and exchanging blows on several occasions. When the group finally reaches the fortress, they are disappointed to see that it is nothing more than abandoned ruins. At the same time, the Mongols have caught up with them and have set up a camp outside the fortress. As the Koreans prepare to make a last stand, the princess attempts to give herself up to the Mongols in exchange for peace, but Yeo-sol and Choi-Jung stop her. A fight breaks out between the two men and the Mongols, resulting in Yeo-sol being captured. Rambulwha, who is impressed with Yeo-sol's skill, offers to let the latter join his army but Yeo-sol refuses and returns to the fortress to help his fellows. In the final battle, the defenders' gunpowder traps backfire when the Mongols launch a fire attack and stage a raid on the fortress. Yeo-sol sacrifices himself to save the princess while Choi-Jung and Rambulwha kill each other. All the Koreans perish along with their Mongol enemies, except for Dae-Jung.

It is an adaptation of the novel The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, about the resistance to the Armenian genocide at Musa Dagh, at the time in Aleppo Vilayet, Ottoman Empire and now in Hatay Province, Turkey.\nEdward Minasian wrote in \"The Forty Years of Musa Dagh\" that the movie is \"a modest memorial to the heroes of Musa Dagh and to the innocent victims of man’s inhumanity to man.\"\n\n\n== Cast ==\nKabir Bedi as Gabriel Bagradian\nJames Reidel of The New York Review of Books wrote that Bedi's \"acting skills could not make up for\" deficiencies in the script and the other actors.\nRonnie Carol as Juliette Bagradian\nCarol was an Eileen Ford model.\nPaul King as Steven Bagradian\nGuy Stockwell as Simon Tomassian\nPeter Haskell as Maris Durand\nMichael Constantine as Talaat Pasha\nDavid Mauro as Enver Pasha\nDavid Opatoshu as Henry Morgenthau, Sr.\nGilbert Greene as Johannes Lepsius\nJohn Hoyt as General Waggenheim\n\n\n== Development and production ==\nThere were attempts beginning in the 1930s to produce a film adaptation of the novel but the Turkish government used diplomatic and financial pressure to convince MGM to not make the film. Turkish Ambassador to the U.S. Münir Ertegün was afraid that the production of the film would seriously damage Turkey-United States relations.\nMGM sold the rights to the film to Kurkjian. Kurkjian, a real estate developer, did not have a lot of experience with filming when he received the rights. Kurkjian initially hoped a studio would make an offer for the filming rights, but chose to begin production himself in 1982 because his rights would contractually expire six weeks later. Kurkjian asked Hakobian to incorporate the best elements of various Musa Dagh scripts into this production. Reidel wrote that the resulting script \"bore only a thin resemblance to the novel.\"\nMinasian wrote that the film produced by Kurkjian differed from the envisioned large budget film that MGM had originally planned to make; the actors were \"unknown\". The budget of the film was $1 million even though the producers hoped for $8-10 million; therefore they removed multiple scenes, and Minasian stated that the final product was \"greatly reduced in scope\". In addition labor costs used up much of the budget; Reidel described the costs as \"union-scale\".\nFilming locations included Malibu, California, and hill areas around Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Release, reception and legacy ==\nThe bulk of screenings were for ethnic Armenian audiences, and commercial theaters did not air it.\nDavid Welky, author of \"Global Hollywood Versus National Pride: The Battle to Film The Forty Days of Musa Dagh,\" wrote that not very many film critics watched the film, and the few that did \"savaged\" it. Welky stated that Forty Days of Musa Dagh was \"a slapped-together farce that lacked cohesiveness\" and that it \"never had a chance of meeting the grand expectations MGM once had for [the concept].\" According to a review by Variety, The Forty Days of Musa Dagh was \"a dreary little film that does no justice to its weighty subject.\" Reidel wrote that \"the end result was not a real film, not even a B-picture.\"\nGeorge S. Harris, author of \"Cementing Turkish-American Relations: The Ambassadorship of (Mehmet) Münir Ertegün (1934-1944)\", stated that the lack of exposure of the film meant that Turkey-United States relations would remain unharmed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\nMinasian, Edward. \"The Forty Years of Musa Dagh: The Film That Was Denied.\" Journal of Armenian Studies, National Association for Armenian Studies and Research (NAASR).

From 1982 to 1993 he was the director of Sogn Folk Museum, from 1993 to 2010 he was the director of Maihaugen and from 2001 he has been the director of the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History. In 2010 he was decorated with the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. A secret society is an organization about which the activities, events, inner functioning, or membership are concealed. The society may or may not attempt to conceal its existence. The term usually excludes covert groups, such as intelligence agencies or guerrilla warfare insurgencies, that hide their activities and memberships but maintain a public presence.    Definitions  The exact qualifications for labeling a group a secret society are disputed, but definitions generally rely on the degree to which the organization insists on secrecy, and might involve the retention and transmission of secret knowledge, the denial of membership or knowledge of the group, the creation of personal bonds between members of the organization, and the use of secret rites or rituals which solidify members of the group. Anthropologically and historically, secret societies have been deeply interlinked with the concept of the Männerbund, the all-male \"warrior-band\" or \"warrior-society\" of pre-modern cultures (see H. Schurtz, Alterklassen und Männerbünde, Berlin, 1902; A. Van Gennep, The Rites of Passage, Chicago, 1960). A purported \"family tree of secret societies\" has been proposed, although it may not be comprehensive. Alan Axelrod, author of the International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders, defines a secret society as an organization that:  is exclusive claims to own special secrets shows a strong inclination to favor its members. Historian Richard B. Spence of the University of Idaho offered a similar three-pronged definition:   The group's existence is usually not kept secret, but some beliefs or practices are concealed from the public and require an oath of secrecy and loyalty to learn. The group promises superior status or knowledge to members. The group's membership is in some way restrictive, such as by race, sex, religious affiliation, or invitation only. Spence also proposes a sub-category of \"Elite Secret Societies\" (composed of high-income or socially influential people) and notes that secret societies have a frequent if not universal tendency towards factionalism, infighting, and claiming origins older than can be reliably documented. Spence's definition includes groups traditionally thought of as secret societies (Freemasons and Rosicrucians) and other groups not so traditionally classified such as certain organized crime cabals (the Mafia), religious groups (Order of Assassins and Thelema) and political movements (Bolsheviks and Black Dragon Society). Historian Jasper Ridley argues that Freemasonry is, \"the world's most powerful secret Society\". The organization \"Opus Dei\" (Latin for \"Work of God\") is portrayed as a \"secret society\" of the Catholic Church. Critics such as the Jesuit Wladimir Ledóchowski sometimes refer to Opus Dei as a Catholic (or Christian or \"white\") form of Freemasonry. Other critics label Opus Dei as \"Holy Mafia\" or \"Santa Mafia\"    Realms     Politics  Because some secret societies have political aims, they are illegal in several countries. Italy (Constitution of Italy, Section 2, Articles 13–28) and Poland, for example, ban secret political parties and political organizations in their constitutions.    Colleges and universities   Many student societies established on university campuses in the United States have been considered secret societies. Perhaps one of the most famous secret collegiate societies is Skull and Bones at Yale University. The influence of undergraduate secret societies at colleges such as Harvard College, Cornell University, Florida State University, Dartmouth College, Emory University, the University of Chicago, the University of Virginia, Georgetown University, New York University, and Wellesley College has been publicly acknowledged, if anonymously and circumspectly, since the 19th century. British universities have a long history of secret societies or quasi-secret clubs, such as The Pitt Club at Cambridge University, Bullingdon Club at Oxford University, the Kate Kennedy Club, The Kensington Club and the Praetorian Club at the University of St Andrews, and the 16' Club at St David's College. Another British secret society is the Cambridge Apostles, founded as an essay and debating society in 1820. Not all British universities host solely academic secret societies; both The Night Climbers of Cambridge and The Night Climbers of Oxford require both brains and brawn. In France, Vandermonde is the secret society of the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers. Notable examples in Canada include Episkopon at the University of Toronto's Trinity College, and the Society of Thoth at the University of British Columbia. Secret societies are disallowed in a few colleges. The Virginia Military Institute has rules that no cadet may join a secret society, and secret societies have been banned at Oberlin College from 1847 to the present, and at Princeton University since the beginning of the 20th century. Confraternities in Nigeria are secret-society-like student groups within higher education, some of which have histories of violence and organized crime. The Morgan family is an American family and banking dynasty, which became prominent in the U.S. and throughout the world in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Members of the family amassed an immense fortune over the generations, primarily through the work of Junius Spencer (J.S.) Morgan (1813–1890) and John Pierpont (J. P.) Morgan Sr. (1837–1913). Morgan members dominated the banking industry during their time. J. P. Morgan was the de facto leader of this dynasty, having been the most prominent businessman in America at the turn of the century. He revolutionized numerous industries, including electricity, railroad, and steel. Through his business methods, he was highly successful in asserting his power as one of the most influential businessmen in America. Historians describe the Morgan family along with its web of partners to be part of the large American banking empire known as the House of Morgan.  It is difficult to place an exact beginning and end date on the dynasty. However, many scholars  attribute the death of J. P. Morgan to the end of the banking dynasty.  In The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance, Ron Chernow chronicles the lives of the Morgans, which he described as \"encrusted with legend... ripe with mystery, [and] exposed to such bitter polemics\".    History  The Morgan family came to some prominence in Wales during the 17th century. Born in Llandaff, Glamorgan County in 1616, Miles Morgan was the son of lawyer and politician William Morgan, who would be elected a Member of Parliament in 1628. At the age of 20, Miles sailed for America, along with his brothers, John and James, seeking new opportunities in the New World. Arriving in April 1636, he landed in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Settling in Roxbury and later Springfield, Massachusetts, Miles met Prudence Gilbert, his future wife. Miles was a soldier during the sack of Springfield. He later worked on a farm and lived a comfortable life. He continued living in the city until the age of eighty-three. One of his sons, Nathaniel, continued the legacy of the Morgan name by becoming a powerful member of his small town. Nathaniel had many professions in his town, including Fence Viewer, hayward, field driver, constable, surveyor, and assessor. He married Hannah Bird on 19 January 1691, daughter of James Bird of Farmington, Connecticut. Nathaniel's son, Joseph Morgan, was the fifth of seven children. Born on 3 December 1702, Joseph began to learn to weave at a young age. At the age of 21, he became a soldier in the company of Captain Josiah Kellogg of Suffield. Upon his father's death, he inherited part of Chicopee Field. He married Mary Stebbins in 1735 and raised a family on a farm of two hundred acres. Upon his death, he gave much of his property to sons Joseph, Jr., and Titus. Joseph, Jr. was elected Lieutenant and later Captain of the 8th Company in the 3rd Regiment of the Hampshire County, Massachusetts militia on 26 April 1776. Upon his death, one of his sons, Joseph III, received 112 acres of land. Joseph III was the first to enter the financial industry, which is what the family is known for today. He left the family business of working on farms behind. In 1812, he joined the Washington Benevolent Society as a private banker. He moved the family to Hartford, which existed as one of the most prominent trade centers in the Connecticut River Valley. In November 1816, he purchased the Hartford Exchange Coffee House, where he acted as an innkeeper. It stood as the focal point of all business affairs and social activities in the area; the idea of meeting new clients and collaborating with other businessmen in these coffee shops and inns allowed for the growth of the industry in America. In July 1825, he bought the Hartford Bank. Joseph III purchased and reorganized the Hartford Fire Insurance Company into the Aetna Fire Insurance Company. (Many of these business deals were conducted at his inn, which acted as a hub for businessmen.) After a fire struck several New York City buildings, which held insurance plans from Aetna, Joseph Morgan III made prompt payments to the companies. New business suddenly poured in, as the insurance company was seen as highly reliable and trustworthy.  The partners of the firm and the stockholders made large sums of money in future years. After moving from the farming business to the coffee house business, Joseph III decided it was time to turn to finance. He purchased the City Hotel on Main Street, which he renovated and cleaned up; business at the hotel boomed like never before. S.N. Mathur was the Director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau between September 1975 and February 1980. He was also the Director General of Police in Punjab. William George Morgan (January 23, 1870 – December 27, 1942) was the inventor of volleyball, originally called \"Mintonette\", a name derived from the game of badminton which he later agreed to change to better reflect the nature of the sport. He was born in Lockport, New York, U.S. He met James Naismith, inventor of basketball, while Morgan was studying at Springfield College in 1892. Like Naismith, Morgan pursued a career in Physical Education at the YMCA. Influenced by Naismith and basketball, in 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Morgan invented \"Mintonette\" a less vigorous team sport more suitable for older members of the YMCA but one that still required athletic skill. Later Alfred S. Halstead watched it being played and renamed it \"Volleyball\". In 1985, he was inducted into the Volleyball Hall of Fame as the inaugural member.    Early life  William George Morgan graduated from high school at Northfield Mount Hermon School and moved on to attend the YMCA International Training School (Later renamed Springfield College) in Massachusetts with James Naismith, the inventor of basketball. Both Morgan and Naismith pursued careers in Physical Education at the YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association). Auburn, Maine, at the YMCA, was where Morgan spent one year working prior to graduating from Springfield College. During the summer of 1895, Morgan moved to Holyoke, Massachusetts, where he continued to work for the YMCA, becoming the Director of Physical Education. With Morgan being the Director, it allowed him to devise workout plans and teach sports in depth to the young male adults.    Creating the sport   As he worked as the Director of Physical Education at the YMCA in Holyoke, he noticed the game of basketball was not meant for everyone to play. The weaker young men, non-athletic adults, and the older adults were unable to keep up with running up and down the court, along with the amount of contact they would occasionally run into. Morgan then had to think of a game in which everyone would have an equal amount of participation but also had similar objectives to basketball. He wanted to create a game which everyone could play, no matter their age or physical ability. Between trying to run classes at the YMCA and creating a new sport suitable for all, Morgan decided it was best that he use ideas from various sports such as handball, tennis, and badminton, and his own knowledge from sports training methods and experience, to create this new sport. He decided that the game would involve a six-foot, six-inch net in the middle dividing the 2 separate playing areas, and that it would be played on a 30 ft. × 60 ft. court, so that it could be played in gyms anywhere across the nation.  After creating some ground rules, William Morgan had to experiment with his game. First, he had to decide which ball to use. A basketball was too heavy while the basketball bladder was too light. After testing all of the balls he had available, he had come to the conclusion that his best option was to ask A.G. Spalding & Bros. to make him a ball. A young A.G. Spalding & Bros. equipment designer and master marine cloth tailor, Dale Callaghan, developed and produced the first prototype volleyball. Morgan was very pleased with Spalding & Bros. work. They created Morgan the perfect ball for his sport, which was covered in leather, with the circumference of 25–27 inches. The ball was also the perfect weight for Morgan's sport. The ball weighed 9–12 ounces. This new ball that had been made for Morgan's sport was the perfect finishing touch to the basics of the sport. The last thing that had to be done by Morgan was to create a name. Morgan came up with \"Mintonette\" as the new name for his game.    Introducing the sport  The first time Morgan revealed his sport to the other Directors of Physical was at the YMCA located in Springfield, in 1896. He presented his new, creative idea to Dr. Luther Halsey Gulick (director of the professional physical education training school) and the rest of the YMCA Directors of Physical Education. Dr. Gulick was so impressed that he asked Morgan to present his sport at the school's new stadium. In preparation for his big debut, Morgan created 2 teams of 5 men, who would help in demonstrating “Mintonette” in front of the conference delegates in the East Gymnasium at Springfield College. In December of 1895, William Morgan presented his new sport to the world. Sons of the Forest is a survival horror video game developed by Endnight Games and published by Newnight. Serving as the sequel to the 2014 video game The Forest, the story centers on a protagonist sent to a mysterious island to search for a missing CEO and his family, while facing cannibalistic monsters and uncovering an ancient secret buried deep underground. The game was released via early access on February 23, 2023, for Microsoft Windows on Steam, before its full release on February 22, 2024.    Gameplay  Similarly to The Forest, Sons of the Forest puts players in control of a protagonist stranded on an island inhabited by cannibals. Players can build weapons and buildings to aid in their survival. Several new mechanics have been added to the game, such as 3D printing, as well as friendly NPCs. One of the aforementioned NPCs is a companion named Kelvin, who is deaf and unable to speak. Players can give Kelvin written commands on a piece of paper to help with simple tasks such as collecting crafting resources or setting up fires. Players will also encounter Virginia, a three-legged, three-armed woman who can be equipped with weapons to aid in combat situations. The map in this game is four times bigger than that of its predecessor. The game supports up to eight-player cooperative multiplayer, though players can also opt to play the game solo. Depending on their actions, players can receive different endings.    Plot  Many years after the events of The Forest, a team of private military contractors hired by PuffCorp is dispatched to an island called \"Site 2\" to search for Edward Puffton (PuffCorp's founder and CEO), his wife Barbara, and his 20 year old daughter Virginia, who have been missing for several months. Jack Holt, the player's character, is a renowned journalist and personal friend of Edward who accompanies the team. The team's helicopters are then shot down by unknown assailants. Jack survives the crash but is knocked out by a man in a silver coat named Jianyu Zhang, a former PuffCorp employee now working for Sahara Therapeutics: the corporation responsible for the events on Site 1. Jack awakens with another surviving teammate named Kelvin, who was rendered deaf and mentally handicapped by the crash.  Working together, Jack and Kelvin set up camp and obtain resources to survive the island, and to defend themselves from cannibal tribes and underground mutants. They are also joined by Virginia, who became a mutant but somehow managed to retain her humanity. As Jack explores the island, he finds sprawling cave systems, underground bunkers, luxury facilities, and ancient structures showing evidence of an advanced civilization. From documents he finds along the way, Jack learns that PuffCorp acquired the island under the guise of turning it into a resort, but was actually competing secretly with Sahara Therapeutics over control of an artifact known as the \"Cube\". This includes a rare and previously undiscovered golden ore named \"Solafite\", which the Cube and the island's other relics are composed of, and is found to have medicinal properties. Jack eventually finds surveillance footage showing that all the resort guests were suddenly transformed into mutants at a dinner party; Edward and Barbara Puffton were among them, and he is forced to kill them when he finds them.   Jack also encounters Tim and Eric LeBlanc, the famed survivors of the Site 1 incident, who have come in search of the Cube to cure Tim of his uncontrollable mutations. After being separated from the pair during a stand-off with Jianyu, Jack learns that the Cube can travel between alternate dimensions, will \"activate\" every eight lunar cycles, and that the only safe haven is inside the Cube itself. It is then deduced that the Cube's activations were what caused the mass mutations throughout the island, thus creating the cannibals and the mutants, and that the next activation is due to be soon. At the VIP bunker, Jack reunites with Tim and they make their way underground towards the Cube; they manage to get inside just before it closes, locking Jianyu outside. When the Cube activates, Tim has a seizure and briefly splits into multiple versions of himself before the Cube shows them a vision of a futuristic alien city. The Cube deactivates, resets its timer, and reopens to show Jianyu has mutated into a gigantic monster. Jack and Tim return to the surface to see helicopters arriving, but are forced to fight Jianyu. After defeating him, an artifact found by the player will strip Jack of his backpack, and then attempt to lure him back towards it. Several endings are then possible:  If the player decides to retrieve their backpack, or simply waits, Jack decides to stay behind on the island and the LeBlancs leave without him. If the player decides to board the helicopter, Jack leaves the island with the LeBlancs. In the epilogue, Tim shows a sample of Solafite to a doctor.

The capital is the city of Quetzaltenango, the second largest city in Guatemala. The department is divided up into 24 municipalities. The inhabitants include Spanish-speaking Ladinos and the Kʼicheʼ and Mam Maya groups, both with their own Maya language. The department consists of mountainous terrain, with its principal river being the Samalá River. the department is seismically active, suffering from both earthquakes and volcanic activity. Prior to the Spanish conquest the territory included in the modern department formed a part of the Kʼicheʼ Kingdom of Qʼumarkaj. The kingdom was defeated by the Spanish under Pedro de Alvarado in a number of decisive battles fought near the city of Quetzaltenango, then known as Xelaju. In the 19th century the territory of the modern department was included in the short-lived Central American state of Los Altos. The department was created by decree in 1845, five years after the fledgling state was crushed by Rafael Carrera. The department has wide variations in local climate, due largely to marked differences in altitude in different areas. The year is divided into wet and dry seasons, with the wet season lasting from July to September and the dry season running from December to February. The wide climatic variation in the department allows for the production of a variety of agricultural products, including temperate fruits, vegetables and cereals in the highlands, as well as coffee on the lower slopes. Quetzaltenango department has produced a number of high-profile Guatemalans, including several presidents as well as a number of musicians.    Name  The department takes its name from the city of Quetzaltenango, which serves as the departmental capital. Although the original Kʼicheʼ inhabitants knew the city by the name Xelaju, the Nahuatl-speaking allies of the Spanish Conquistadors named it Quetzaltenango in their own language, meaning \"land of the quetzal birds\".    History     Early history  The territory that came to be included within the modern department of Quetzaltenango was the scene of several decisive battles in February 1524 between Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado and the Kʼicheʼ Kingdom of Qʼumarkaj. Pedro de Alvarado had initially advanced with his army along the Pacific coast without opposition until they reached the Samalá River; this region formed a part of the Kʼicheʼ kingdom. Alvarado then turned to head upriver into the Sierra Madre mountains towards the Kʼicheʼ heartlands, crossing the pass into the fertile valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado's Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by the Kʼicheʼ warriors but the Spanish cavalry charge that followed was a shock for the Kʼicheʼ who had never seen horses before. The cavalry scattered the Kʼicheʼ and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju, modern Quetzaltenango, to find it deserted by its inhabitants. Although the common view is that the Kʼicheʼ prince Tecun Uman died in the later battle near Olintepeque, the Spanish accounts are clear that at least one and possibly two of the lords of Qʼumarkaj died in the fierce battles upon the initial approach to Quetzaltenango. The death of Tecun Uman is said to have taken place in the battle of El Pinar, and local tradition has his death taking place upon the Llanos de Urbina (Plains of Urbina), upon the approach to Quetzaltenango near the modern village of Cantel. Pedro de Alvardo, in his 3rd letter to Hernán Cortés, describes the death of one of the four lords of Qʼumarkaj upon the approach to Quetzaltenango. The letter was dated 11 April 1524 and was written during his stay at Qʼumarkaj. Almost a week later, on 18 February 1524, a Kʼicheʼ army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley where they were comprehensively defeated, with many Kʼicheʼ nobles among the dead. Such were the numbers of Kʼicheʼ dead that Olintepeque was given the new name Xequiquel, roughly meaning \"bathed in blood\". The Eder [ˈeːdɐ] is a 177-kilometre-long (110 mi) major river in Germany that begins in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia and passes in to Hesse, where it empties into the River Fulda.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe river was first mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus. In his Annals, he describes the Roman campaign against the Chatti under the command of Germanicus in 15 AD. Forty-five thousand soldiers of the Roman army destroyed the major centre of the Chatti, Mattium, directly after they crossed the Adrana (Eder).\nIn the Middle Ages, the river was known by the names; Aderna, Adarna, Adrina.\nOn the banks of the Eder, in the town of Schwarzenau, near Bad Berleburg, a religious group was founded in August 1708; the Schwarzenau Brethren. Eight adults were completely baptised thrice in the Eder. This group emigrated to America where they are still to be found.\nAs late as up to the end of the 19th century, the river was also known in local dialect as Edder. For instance, in Felsberg-Gensungen, the pharmacy is known as the Edder-Apotheke.\n\n\n== Gold in the Eder ==\nSediments of the Eder contain a proportion of gold. The majority of this gold is said to originate from Eisenberg (Korbach), which contains one of the largest reserves of gold in Middle Europe. Gold is eroded out of the Eisenberg, for example, by the Itter stream, which, since the Edersee dam was built, flows into the Edersee lake.\nGold panning in the Eder has been known since 1308. The main historical area for panning the gold is between Affoldern and Fritzlar. In the 14th century, the Teutonic Order panned gold out of the Eder sediments near Obermöllrich. In the 18th century, even ducats were minted from Eder gold; they are collector's items today.\nUp to the 1970s, school children from Duisburg, who stayed at a nearby holiday camp, together with a teacher from Marienhagen, part of the town of Vöhl, went panning for gold in the sediments of the River Itter. Panning for gold along the Eder is still popular.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe river rises from the Ederkopf mountain in the Rothaar mountain range in eastern North Rhine-Westphalia, near the springs of the Lahn and Sieg rivers. However, unlike the Lahn and Sieg, which are both tributaries of the Rhine, the Eder flows east and north, into the river Fulda at Edermünde, south of Kassel. The Fulda then converges with the Werra River at Hann. Münden to form the Weser River, which flows in to the North Sea.\n\n\n== Edersee Dam ==\n\nThe Edersee Dam is situated below the town of Waldeck. It is constructed of rock and concrete, and is 47 metres (154 ft) high and 400 metres (1,300 ft) long. It was completed in 1914; in 2014 its 100th birthday was celebrated. It forms the Edersee lake, which is 27 kilometres (17 mi) long and contains 200 million cubic metres of water. This is used to generate hydroelectricity and to regulate water levels for shipping on the Weser river.\nAt low water in late summer, and during dry years, the remnants of three villages (Asel, Bringhausen, and Berich) and a bridge across the original river bed, which was submerged when the lake was filled in 1914, can be seen. Descendants of those buried there go to visit the graves of their ancestors.\n\n\n== Destruction of the Eder dam ==\n\nOn the night of the 17 May 1943, Avro Lancaster bombers of the RAF 617 Squadron used specially-developed bouncing bombs (codename: Upkeep) that were engineered by Barnes Wallis. They were used to destroy the Möhne and Eder dams, as part of Operation Chastise. The dam was repaired and in use again before the end of the year. The story of the raid was documented by the 1955 film called The Dam Busters.\n\n\n== Tributaries of the Eder ==\n\nThe most important tributaries of the Eder are (listed first in Eder-kilometres from source to the Fulda):\n\nrivers that used to flow to the Eder, but now flow in to the Edersee lake.\n\n\n== References == Marbeck is a river of Hesse, Germany.

Santa Cruz Muluá is a municipality in the Retalhuleu department of Guatemala. Its name comes from the ancient mayan word\" Mulaja\" which means\" Land Between Rivers,\" because its between the Samalá River, the Rio Muluá and many other small rivers and streams. It is situated 180 km from Guatemala City. The administrative center is bounded by the Samalá River to the west, which serves as the border with San Sebastián. Santa Cruz Muluá borders on the north with San Martín Zapotitlán, with theme parks Xetulul and Xocomil. Also to the north lies San Felipe famous for its blood sausage(\" moronga\" locally), to the east and the south is San Andrés Villa Seca. Santa Cruz Mulua municipality contains several villages: El Asintal( also Canton Asintal), Los Brillantes( also Finca Los Brilliantes), Boxoma further to the south and not often visited and, Lolita, which is the most distant and close the Pacific coast.

The event had a probable Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7, making it one of the largest volcanic eruptions during the Holocene epoch. It left behind a large caldera that contains Lake Segara Anak. Later volcanic activity created more volcanic centres in the caldera, including the Barujari cone, which remains active. The event created eruption columns reaching tens of kilometres into the atmosphere and pyroclastic flows that buried much of Lombok and crossed the sea to reach the neighbouring island of Sumbawa. The flows destroyed human habitations, including the city of Pamatan, which was the capital of a kingdom on Lombok. Ash from the eruption fell as far as 340 kilometres (210 mi) away in Java; the volcano deposited more than 10 cubic kilometres (2.4 cu mi) of rocks and ash. The aerosols injected into the atmosphere reduced the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, causing a volcanic winter and cooling the atmosphere for several years. This led to famines and crop failures in Europe and elsewhere, although the exact scale of the temperature anomalies and their consequences is still debated. The eruption may have helped trigger the Little Ice Age, a centuries-long cold period during the last thousand years. Before the site of the eruption was known, an examination of ice cores around the world had detected a large spike in sulfate deposition from around 1257 providing strong evidence of a large volcanic eruption occurring at that time. In 2013, scientists linked the historical records about Mount Samalas to these spikes. These records were written by people who witnessed the event and recorded it on the Babad Lombok, a document written on palm leaves.    Geology  Samalas (also known as Rinjani Tua) was part of what is now the Rinjani volcanic complex, on Lombok, in Indonesia. The remains of the volcano form the Segara Anak caldera, with Mount Rinjani at its eastern edge. Since the destruction of Samalas, two new volcanoes, Rombongan and Barujari, have formed in the caldera. Mount Rinjani has also been volcanically active, forming its own crater, Segara Muncar. Other volcanoes in the region include Agung, Batur, and Bratan, on the island of Bali to the west.  Lombok is one of the Lesser Sunda Islands in the Sunda Arc of Indonesia, a subduction zone where the Australian plate subducts beneath the Eurasian plate at a rate of 7 centimetres per year (2.8 in/year). The magmas feeding Mount Samalas and Mount Rinjani are likely derived from peridotite rocks beneath Lombok, in the mantle wedge. Before the eruption, Mount Samalas may have been as tall as 4,200 ± 100 metres (13,780 ± 330 ft), based on reconstructions that extrapolate upwards from the surviving lower slopes, and thus taller than Mount Kinabalu which is presently the highest mountain in tropical Asia; Samalas's current height is less than that of the neighbouring Mount Rinjani, which reaches 3,726 metres (12,224 ft). The oldest geological units on Lombok are from the Oligocene–Miocene, with old volcanic units cropping out in southern parts of the island. Samalas was built up by volcanic activity before 12,000 BP. Rinjani formed between 11,940 ± 40 and 2,550 ± 50 BP, with an eruption between 5,990 ± 50 and 2,550 ± 50 BP forming the Propok Pumice with a dense rock equivalent volume of 0.1 cubic kilometres (0.024 cu mi). The Rinjani Pumice, with a volume of 0.3 cubic kilometres (0.072 cu mi) dense rock equivalent, may have been deposited by an eruption from either Rinjani or Samalas; it is dated to 2,550 ± 50 BP, at the end of the time range during which Rinjani formed. The deposits from this eruption reached thicknesses of 6 centimetres (2.4 in) 28 kilometres (17 mi) away. Additional eruptions by either Rinjani or Samalas are dated 11,980 ± 40, 11,940 ± 40, and 6,250 ± 40 BP. Eruptive activity continued until about 500 years before 1257. Most volcanic activity now occurs at the Barujari volcano with eruptions in 1884, 1904, 1906, 1909, 1915, 1966, 1994, 2004, and 2009; Rombongan was active in 1944.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Did the movies Pony Express (Film) and The Da Vinci Code (Film), originate from the same country?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe Da Vinci Code is a 2003 mystery thriller novel by Dan Brown. It is Brown's second novel to include the character Robert Langdon: the first was his 2000 novel Angels & Demons.  The Da Vinci Code follows symbologist Langdon and cryptologist Sophie Neveu after a murder in the Louvre Museum in Paris entangles them in a dispute between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Jesus and Mary Magdalene having had a child together. The novel explores an alternative religious history, whose central plot point is that the Merovingian kings of France were descended from the bloodline of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, ideas derived from Clive Prince's The Templar Revelation (1997) and books by Margaret Starbird. The book also refers to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982), though Dan Brown has stated that it was not used as research material. The Da Vinci Code provoked a popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and Mary Magdalene's role in the history of Christianity. The book has, however, been extensively denounced by many Christian denominations as an attack on the Catholic Church, and also consistently criticized by scholars for its historical and scientific inaccuracies. The novel nonetheless became a massive worldwide bestseller that sold 80 million copies as of 2009 and has been translated into 44 languages. In November 2004, Random House published a Special Illustrated Edition with 160 illustrations. In 2006, a film adaptation was released by Columbia Pictures.    Plot  Louvre curator and Priory of Sion grand master Jacques Saunière is fatally shot one night at the museum by an albino Catholic monk named Silas, who is working on behalf of someone he knows only as the Teacher, who wishes to discover the location of the \"keystone,\" an item crucial in the search for the Holy Grail. After Saunière's body is discovered in the pose of the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci, the police summon Harvard professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business. Police captain Bezu Fache tells him that he was summoned to help the police decode the cryptic message Saunière left during the final minutes of his life. The message includes a Fibonacci sequence out of order and an anagram: 'O, draconian devil! Oh, lame saint!'.  Langdon explains to Fache that the pentacle Saunière drew on his chest in his own blood represents an allusion to the goddess and not devil worship, as Fache believes. Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer, secretly explains to Langdon that she is Saunière's estranged granddaughter and that Fache thinks Langdon is the murderer because the last line in her grandfather's message, which was meant for Neveu, said \"P.S. Find Robert Langdon,\" which Fache had erased prior to Langdon's arrival.  However, \"P.S.\" does not refer to \"postscript\", but rather to Sophie — the nickname given to her by her grandfather was \"Princess Sophie\". She understands that her grandfather intended Langdon to decipher the code, which leads to Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, which in turn leads to his painting Madonna of the Rocks. They find a pendant that holds the address of the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich.  Neveu and Langdon escape from the police and visit the bank. In the safe deposit box, they find a box containing the keystone: a cryptex, a cylindrical, hand-held vault with five concentric, rotating dials labeled with letters. When they are lined up correctly, they unlock the device. If the cryptex is forced open, an enclosed vial of vinegar breaks and dissolves the message inside the cryptex, which was written on papyrus. The box containing the cryptex contains clues to its password. Langdon and Neveu take the keystone to the home of Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the Holy Grail, the legend of which is heavily connected to the Priory. There, Teabing explains that the Grail is not a cup, but connected to Mary Magdalene, and that she was Jesus Christ's wife and is the person to his right in The Last Supper. The trio then flee the country on Teabing's private plane, on which they conclude that the proper combination of letters spells out Neveu's given name, Sofia. Opening the cryptex, they discover a smaller cryptex inside it, along with another riddle that ultimately leads the group to the tomb of Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey. During the flight to Britain, Neveu reveals the source of her estrangement from her grandfather ten years earlier: arriving home unexpectedly from university, Neveu secretly witnessed a spring fertility rite conducted in the secret basement of her grandfather's country estate. The official motion picture soundtrack for The Da Vinci Code with Thomas Bowes (violinist), King's Consort Choir, Hugh Marsh, Orchestra, Richard Harvey, Hila Plitmann, Martin Tillman was released on May 9, 2006 via Decca label.

Pony Express is an American Western television series about the adventures of an agent in the 1860s of the Central Overland Express Company, better known as the Pony Express. The half-hour program starring Grant Sullivan and Don Dorrell was created by California National Productions. Pony Express ran for thirty-five episodes in syndication from the fall of October 1959 until May 1960. In its final days, the series just managed to coincide with the centennial of the Pony Express (April 3, 1860). \n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe series featured two recurring roles: Grant Sullivan as Brett Clark, a roving investigator for the company, and Don Dorrell as Donovan, a young Pony Express rider. The majority of the weekly episodes involved Clark and Donovan solving various Pony Express mysteries.\n\n\n== Production ==\nPony Express was filmed at Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth in Los Angeles County, California. It was one of several western-themed television shows produced by CNP, such as Boots and Saddles (1957–1958). CNP created the series for the 100th anniversary of the actual Pony Express.\nThe Pony Express pilot, the first Western television pilot shot in color, was shot in February 1957 with James Best in the lead. This version did not sell (although Best was included in a TV Guide photo feature on upcoming TV westerns in June of that year) but was later aired, slightly re-edited, as an episode of the syndicated series.\n\n\n== Guest stars ==\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPony Express, film\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPony Express at IMDb\nPony Express at CVTA The Da Vinci Code is a novel by Dan Brown published in 2003.\nThe Da Vinci Code may also refer to:\n\nThe Da Vinci Code (film), the 2006 film based on the novel\nThe Da Vinci Code (soundtrack), a CD based on the music of the film\nThe Da Vinci Code (video game), the 2006 game based on the novel, and timed for release with the movie\nThe Da Vinci Code (play), a 2022 stage adaption based on the novel\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAll pages with titles containing Da Vinci Code\nAll pages with titles containing DaVinci Code\nDa Vinci (disambiguation) The Pony Express was an American express mail service that used relays of horse-mounted riders between Missouri and California.  It was operated by the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company. During its 18 months of operation beginning in 1860, the Pony Express reduced the time for messages to travel between the east and west US coast to about 10 days. It became the west's most direct means of east–west communication before the first transcontinental telegraph was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new state of California with the rest of the United States. Despite a heavy subsidy, the Pony Express was not a financial success and went bankrupt in 18 months, when a faster telegraph service was established.  Nevertheless, it demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the Old West. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the frontier times.    Inception and founding   The idea of having a fast mail route to the Pacific Coast was prompted largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After gold was discovered there in 1848, thousands of prospectors, investors, and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000. The prospect of California and its national role became the source of bitter partisan debate in Congress. The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the American Civil War approached. William Russell, Alexander Majors, and William B. Waddell were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and drayage business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons, and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank, and an insurance company. Russell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community. Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. In 1859, C.R. Morehead took the proposal for the Pony Express to President Buchanan. After Morehead was bought out and moved to Leavenworth to enter the mercantile business, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855, they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell. They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. government for fast mail delivery. By using a short route and mounted riders rather than traditional stagecoaches, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, which many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per 1⁄2 ounce (14 g), then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The initial price was 250 times the price of mail through the normal mail service, which was $0.02. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about. Russell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 80 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861. Majors was a religious man and resolved \"by the help of God\" to overcome all difficulties. He presented each rider with a Pony Express special-edition Bible and required this oath, which they were also required to sign.  I,  ... , do hereby swear, before the Great and Living God, that during my engagement, and while I am an employee of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, I will, under no circumstances, use profane language, that I will drink no intoxicating liquors, that I will not quarrel or fight with any other employee of the firm, and that in every respect I will conduct myself honestly, be faithful to my duties, and so direct all my acts as to win the confidence of my employers, so help me God.\"    Operation   In 1860, the  roughly 186 Pony Express stations were about 10 to 15 miles (16 to 24 km) apart along the Pony Express route. The Da Vinci Code is a 2006 American mystery thriller film, directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldsman, based on Dan Brown's 2003 best- selling novel of the same name. The first in the\" Robert Langdon\" film series, the film stars Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Sir Ian McKellen, Alfred Molina, Jürgen Prochnow, Jean Reno and Paul Bettany. In the movie, Robert Langdon, a professor of religious symbology from Harvard University, is the prime suspect in the grisly and unusual murder of Louvre curator Jacques Saunière. In the body, the police find a disconcerting cipher and start an investigation. A noted British Grail historian named Sir Leigh Teabing tells them that the actual Holy Grail is explicitly encoded in Leonardo da Vinci's wall painting,\" The Last Supper\". Also searching for the Grail is a secret cabal within Opus Dei, an actual prelature of the Holy See, who wish to keep the true Grail a secret to prevent the destruction of Christianity. The film, like the book, was considered controversial. It was met with especially harsh criticism by the Catholic Church for the accusation that it is behind a two- thousand- year- old cover- up concerning what the Holy Grail really is and the concept that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were married and that the union produced a daughter, as well as its treatment of the organizations Priory of Sion and Opus Dei. Many members urged the laity to boycott the film. In the book, Dan Brown states that the Priory of Sion and\" all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\" The film grossed$ 224 million in its worldwide opening weekend and a total of$ 758 million worldwide, becoming the second- highest- grossing film of 2006. The film received generally negative reviews from critics. It was followed by two sequels,\" Angels& Demons\"( 2009) and\" Inferno\"( 2016).

The film grossed $224 million in its worldwide opening weekend and a total of $760 million worldwide against a $125 million budget, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 2006, as well as Howard's highest-grossing film to date. However, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. It was followed by two sequels, Angels & Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016).    Plot  Jacques Saunière, a Louvre curator, is pursued by an albino Catholic monk named Silas, who demands the location of the \"keystone\" to find and destroy the Holy Grail. Saunière gives him a false lead and is murdered. The police find his body posed like Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. Police captain Bezu Fache summons American symbologist Robert Langdon, who is in Paris for a lecture on the interpretation of symbols, to examine Saunière's body. Langdon is shown the body and a secret message, readable only by UV light. It contains an out-of-order Fibonacci sequence. Sophie Neveu, a police cryptographer and Saunière's granddaughter, tells Langdon that Fache planted a tracker on him after finding the words, \"P.S. Find Robert Langdon\" at the end of Saunière's secret message. Fache believes that Langdon murdered Saunière. Sophie throws away the tracker, distracting the police while they sneak around the Louvre, finding more clues in Leonardo da Vinci's works. Langdon deduces that Saunière was the grand master of the Priory of Sion. Silas works for an anonymous person referred to as \"The Teacher\", along with members of Opus Dei, led by Bishop Aringarosa. He travels to the church as directed by Saunière and finds a marker with \"Job 38:10\" inscribed in it, a bible verse that begins, \"Here you shall come, and no farther...\" Enraged, he kills the nun in residence. Langdon and Sophie travel to a French bank and access Saunière's safe deposit box by using the Fibonacci sequence. Inside is a cryptex, a cylindrical container that contains a message on papyrus. It can only be opened without destroying the contents by turning dials to spell a code word. As the police arrive, bank manager Andre Vernet helps Langdon and Sophie escape, then attempts to steal the cryptex and murder them. Langdon and Sophie escape with the cryptex. They visit Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail expert. Teabing claims the Grail is not a cup but instead is Mary Magdalene. He says she was not a prostitute but the wife of Jesus Christ. Teabing argues that Mary was pregnant during Jesus' crucifixion, and the Priory was formed to protect their descendants. Pony Express is a 1953 American western film directed by Jerry Hopper and starring Charlton Heston as Buffalo Bill, Forrest Tucker as Wild Bill Hickok, Jan Sterling as a Calamity Jane- type character, and Rhonda Fleming that was filmed in Kanab, Utah. The story is largely based on the 1925 silent film\" The Pony Express\" and tells a completely imaginary account of the formation of the Pony Express rapid transcontinental mail delivery in the United States in 1860- 1861. The picture gives no credit to the real founders of the Pony Express. Buffalo Bill Cody did ride for them —he signed up when he was 15 years old. == Plot ==\nIn 1860, Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill Hickok join forces to establish a mail route from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California.

Many of the complaints centered on the book's speculations and misrepresentations of core aspects of Christianity and the history of the Catholic Church. Additional criticisms were directed toward the book's inaccurate descriptions of European art, history, architecture, and geography. Charges of copyright infringement were also leveled by the novelist Lewis Perdue and by the authors of the 1982 book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, which puts forward the hypothesis that the historical Jesus married Mary Magdalene, and that their children or their descendants emigrated to what is now southern France, and married into families that became the Merovingian dynasty, whose claim to the throne of France is championed today  by the Priory of Sion. In 2006, a court ruled in Brown's favor, stating that while he did reference the book in parts of his novel, he did not substantially copy it. A similar suit was filed in 2007 by author Jack Dunn, who accused Brown of plagiarizing his 1997 novel The Vatican Boys.    Fact or fiction   Brown prefaces his novel with a page titled \"Fact\" asserting that certain elements in the novel are true in reality, and a page at his website repeats these ideas and others. In the early publicity for the novel, Dan Brown made repeated assertions that, while the novel is a work of fiction, the historical information in it is all accurate and well-researched. For example:  Martin Savidge: When we talk about da Vinci and your book, how much is true and how much is fabricated in your storyline? Dan Brown: 99 percent of it is true. All of the architecture, the art, the secret rituals, the history, all of that is true, the Gnostic gospels. All of that is … all that is fiction, of course, is that there's a Harvard symbologist named Robert Langdon, and all of his action is fictionalized. But the background is all true. Matt Lauer: How much of this is based on reality in terms of things that actually occurred? Dan Brown: Absolutely all of it. Obviously, there are—Robert Langdon is fictional, but all of the art, architecture, secret rituals, secret societies, all of that is historical fact. These claims in the book and by the author, combined with the presentation of religious ideas that some Christians regard as offensive, led to a great deal of controversy and debate, which found its way into political discourse in the media. In May 2006, The Independent reported that Ruth Kelly, a senior British Government Minister, had been scrutinized about her membership in Opus Dei during her early years as an Education Secretary.     Religious disputes     Mary Magdalene  The novel asserts that Mary Magdalene was of the Tribe of Benjamin, but historians dispute this claim, and there is no mention of this in the Bible or in other ancient sources. According to Sandra Miesel and Carl E. Olson, writing in their 2004 book, The Da Vinci Hoax, state the fact that Magdala was located in northern Israel, whereas the tribe of Benjamin resided in the south, weighs against it. In Chapter 58 it is suggested that the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene created a \"potent political union with the potential of making a legitimate claim to the throne.\" Olson and Meisel not only state that this assertion is without any historical basis, but question why Solomon's kingship would have any purpose or meaning today that would motivate a large-scale conspiracy. The authors also question why if Jesus were merely a \"mortal prophet\", as the novel suggests, a royal goddess would have any interest in him. Olson and Meisel quote Chicago archbishop Francis Cardinal George, who remarked, \"Jesus isn't God but Mary Magdalene is a goddess? I mean, what does that mean? If he's not God, why is he married to a goddess?\" Olson and Meisel also argued that having Davidic blood in Jesus' time would not have been unique, since all of his stepfather Joseph's relatives, which included twenty generations of kings of Judah, had it as well. The authors also state that the Benjamites were not considered \"rightful\" heirs to the throne, and that the New Testament does not mention Mary Magdalene's tribal affiliation, and that she was likely not from the tribe of Benjamin, and that her connection with that tribe is traced to the 1982 book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which does not substantiate the idea. Characters in the book also claim that Mary Magdalene was labeled a prostitute by the Church. While Catholic tradition in the past, in contrast to other Christian traditions, defended these imputations, these claims are now rejected by the majority of biblical scholars, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, according to Carol Ann Morrow of AmericanCatholic.org. The Da Vinci Treasure is a 2006 direct-to-video mystery film produced by American studio The Asylum, and directed by Peter Mervis. The film is considered to be a mockbuster of the film \"The Da Vinci Code\", and both films were released within the same month. The Pony Express Museum is a transport museum in Saint Joseph, Missouri, documenting the history of the Pony Express, the first fast mail line across the North American continent from the Missouri River to the Pacific coast. The museum is housed in a surviving portion of the Pike's Peak Stables, from which westward-bound Pony Express riders set out on their journey.\nThe Pony Express Museum is one of the most historically educational museums in the country in respect to the legendary mail service that ran from April, 3, 1860 to October 26, 1861. Between exhibits, a 7-part diorama, maps, an archeological dig and artifacts, the museum has entertained and educated visitors from all over the world. The museum just celebrated the 150th anniversary (Sesquicentennial) of the Pony Express on April 1–3, 2010 which drew over 10,000 people. The museum is located at 914 Penn Street, St. Joseph, Missouri. In 2011, the museum produced a live action documentary titled Days of the Pony Express produced by Jim Conlon with Scout Films. The film was given a favorable review by Wild West Magazine.\n\n\n== Stables ==\nThe Pony Express Stables, also known as Pike's Peak Stables, is a historic stable building located at St. Joseph, Missouri. It is a one-story building, originally built as a wood-frame structure in 1858. Its exterior walls were rebuilt in brick in 1888, whether keeping the original structure intact and/or reused some of its posts and beams. The building marked the eastern terminus of the Pony Express. It is now the home of the museum.\nThe building, originally Pike's Peak Stable, was built for care of horses of the local freight and stagecoach company.  It was bought in 1860 by the Central Overland California and Pike's Peak Express Company to be used for the Pony Express.  In the first Pony Express run on April 3, 1860, William (Billie) Richardson left from here to go the Patee House to pick up a waiting mochilla, then headed west.\nThe building was restored in 1950 by the Goetz Foundation and the Pony Express National Memorial museum was then established. The building is 58.33 by 55.25 feet (17.78 m × 16.84 m) in plan. Its front (north) and side walls are coursed brick, two bricks thick. As of 1970, the rear wall is wood frame on a brick foundation, covered by asbestos board.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Pony Express Stables and Museum, St. Joseph, Missouri at Wikimedia Commons\n\nNational Register profile\nPony Express Stable, visitor information at the National Park Service's \"Pony Express Trail\" webpages\nPony Express Museum Web site\n\"The Story Of The Pony Express\" from the National Postal Museum The Norman Rockwell Code is a 2006 parody of the widely popular movie,\" The Da Vinci Code\".

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Do both Bait (1954 Film) and Dharm Adhikari films have the directors from the same country?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nPavel Haas (21 June 1899 – 17 October 1944) was a Czech composer who was murdered during the Holocaust. He was an exponent of Leoš Janáček's school of composition, and also utilized elements of folk music and jazz. Although his output was not large, he is notable particularly for his song cycles and string quartets.    Pre-war  Haas was born in Brno, into a Moravian-Jewish family. His father, Zikmund, a shoemaker by trade, was from the Moravian region, while his mother, Olga (née Epstein), was born in Odesa. His brother, Hugo Haas (1901–1968), was a popular actor in interwar Czechoslovakia. After studying piano privately, Haas began his more formal musical education at the age of 14 and studied composition at the Brno Conservatory from 1919 to 1921 under Jan Kunc and Vilém Petrželka. This was followed by two years of study in the master class of the noted Czech composer Leoš Janáček. Janáček was by far Haas's most influential teacher, and Haas, in turn, proved to be Janáček's best student. In 1935, he married Soňa Jakobson, the former wife of Russian linguist Roman Jakobson.  Of the more than 50 works Haas wrote during the rest of his life, only 18 were given opus numbers by the self-critical composer. While still working in his father's business, he wrote musical works of all kinds, including symphonic and choral works, lieder, chamber music, and scores for cinema and theatre. His opera, Šarlatán (The Charlatan), was first performed in Brno to sincere acclaim in April 1938. He received the Smetana Foundation award for the opera (sharing the award with Vítězslava Kaprálová who received it for her Military Sinfonietta).    The war   In 1941, Haas was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp (Terezín). He was one of several Moravian-Jewish composers there, including Viktor Ullmann, Gideon Klein and Hans Krása. Prior to his arrest, he had officially divorced his wife Soňa in order that she and their young daughter, Olga, would not suffer a similar fate. In 1938, in desperation, he wrote to relatives of his wife in New Jersey, and also to Frank Rybka in New York, who was a former student of Janáček. An attempt was launched by these Americans to help Haas secure passage, but this came too late to help. On his arrival at Theresienstadt, he became very depressed and had to be coaxed into composition by Gideon Klein. Haas wrote at least eight compositions in the camp, only a few of which have survived. They include a set of Four Songs on Chinese Poetry for baritone and piano, a work for men's choir titled \"Al s'fod\" (his first and only work in Hebrew), and the Study for String Orchestra which was premiered in Theresienstadt under the Czech conductor Karel Ančerl and is probably Haas's best-known work today. The orchestral parts were found by Ančerl after the liberation of Theresienstadt and the score was reconstructed. In 1944 the Nazis remodeled Theresienstadt just before a visit from the Red Cross, and a propaganda film, Der Führer schenkt den Juden eine Stadt (The Führer Gives the Jews a City), was made by director Kurt Gerron, under the coercion of the camp commandant, Karl Rahm. In the film, Theresienstadt, children are seen singing Hans Krása's opera, Brundibár, and Haas can be seen taking a bow after a performance, conducted by Karel Ančerl, of his Study for Strings. When the propaganda project was over, the Nazis transferred 18,000 prisoners, including Haas and the children who had sung in Brundibár, to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they were murdered in the gas chambers. According to the testimony of Karel Ančerl, Haas stood next to him after their arrival at Auschwitz. Doctor Mengele was about to send Ančerl to the gas chamber first, but the weakened Haas began to cough, so the death sentence was chosen for him instead. After the war Ančerl met with Haas's brother Hugo and told him the story.    Post-war  Haas's large-scale symphony, which he began prior to his deportation to Theresienstadt, remained unfinished, but the extant material was orchestrated by Zdeněk Zouhar in 1994.

Jeetendra (born Ravi Kapoor  RAV-ee; 7 April 1942) is an Indian actor who is known for his work in Hindi cinema. He also serves as the chairman of the Balaji Telefilms and Balaji Motion Pictures.    Early life  Jeetendra was born in a Punjabi Khatri family as Ravi Kapoor in Amritsar, Punjab, to Amarnath and Krishna Kapoor, whose business dealt with imitation jewellery, supplied to film industry. He attended St. Sebastian's Goan High School in Mumbai, Mumbai with his friend Rajesh Khanna and then studied at Siddharth College in Mumbai. While supplying jewellery to V. Shantaram, he was cast as Sandhya's character's double in the 1964 movie Geet Gaya Patharon Ne after which his career never turned back.    Career     1964–1970: Debut and breakthrough   Jeetendra began his career in 1964 playing the lead in V. Shantaram's Geet Gaya Patharon Ne alongside Rajshree. Despite heavy promotions and positive reviews, the film proved to be an unsuccessful venture domestically. After a brief period of absence from films, he established himself with Ravikant Nagaich's spy thriller Farz in 1967. A remake of Telugu film Gudachari 116 (1966), it emerged a blockbuster at the box office and made Jeetendra a star. The music of Farz was one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1960s. Majority of its songs like – \"Mast Baharon Ka Main Aashiq\", \"Baar Baar Din Ye Aaye – Happy Birthday To You\", both solos by Mohammed Rafi and \"Hum To Tere Aashiq Hain\", a duet by Mukesh and Lata Mangeshkar remain popular till date. In 1968, he had three releases – Suhaag Raat, Aulad and Mere Huzoor. While, Suhaag Raat and Aulad were critical and commercial failures, the lattermost co-starring Raaj Kumar and Mala Sinha received positive response from reviewers and did decent business at the box office. In 1969, Jeetendra had three major commercial successes with L. V. Prasad's Jeene Ki Raah, T. R. Ramanna's Waris and Ravikant Nagaich's Jigri Dost. He began the 1970s with Chander Vohra's Khilona which also had Sanjeev Kumar and Mumtaz in the lead. The film emerged a huge hit with all the three leads receiving praise for their respective performances. He delivered another superhit that year with T. R. Ramanna's Humjoli which was a remake of blockbuster Tamil film Panakkara Kudumbam (1964).    1971–1979: Career slump and comeback  Despite kicking off the new decade on a successful note, Jeetendra saw a bad phase from 1971 to 1973 as majority of his films underperformed during this period, with Nasir Hussain's crime thriller Caravan (1971) opposite Asha Parekh being the only exception. It was a superhit domestically and an All Time Blockbuster in overseas markets, especially China were it is counted along with the all-time greats – Awaara (1951) and Noorie (1979). Caravan was also one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1970s. Its music composed by R.D. Burman proved to be a cherry on the cake as most of the songs - \"Chadti Jawani Meri Chaal Mastani\", \"Kitna Pyara Wada Hai\" and \"Piya Tu Ab To Aja\" emerged instant hits and played a major role in the mega success of film. During this phase, he also received praise for his portrayal of a kind-hearted tuition teacher in Gulzar's light-hearted drama Parichay. The song \"Musafir Hoon Yaroon\" from Parichay was listed at #25 in the Binaca Geetmala annual list 1973 and is considered to be one of the most loved filmi songs of all time. In 1974, Jeetendra played the lead in L. V. Prasad's Bidaai co-starring Leena Chandavarkar and Durga Khote. The film proved to be a blockbuster at the box office thus ending his dry run and also emerging one of the top 5 highest-grossing films of that year. After scoring two more hits in 1975 with Khushboo and Umar Qaid, the following year, he starred in three major successes, the horror film Nagin and the family dramas Udhar Ka Sindur and Suntan. The Fighting Kentuckian is a 1949 American Adventure Western film written and directed by George Waggner and starring John Wayne, who also produced the film.  The supporting cast featured Vera Ralston; Philip Dorn; Oliver Hardy (of Laurel & Hardy) portraying Wayne's portly sidekick; Marie Windsor; John Howard; Hugo Haas; Grant Withers and Odette Myrtil.    Plot  Returning home from the War of 1812, John Breen, a Kentucky militiaman, falls in love with French exile Fleurette de Marchand. He discovers a plot to steal the land that Fleurette's exiles plan to settle on. Breen is mistaken for a land surveyor and is presented with a theodolite and sets out with Willie to look as if they are surveying (they do not actually know what to do). A further pretense occurs when Breen sits on stage with a group of fiddlers and feigns being able to play. Throughout the film, Breen's soldiers sing:  Only six hundred miles more to go Only six hundred miles more to go And if we can just get lucky We will end up in Kentucky Only six hundred miles more to go When the song is first heard, there are eight hundred miles to go (the tune is \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\").    Cast  John Wayne as John Breen Vera Ralston as Fleurette de Marchand Philip Dorn as Col. Georges Géraud Oliver Hardy as Willie Paine Marie Windsor as Ann Logan John Howard as Blake Randolph Hugo Haas as Gen. Paul de Marchand Grant Withers as George Hayden Odette Myrtil as Madame de Marchand Paul Fix as Beau Merritt Mae Marsh as Sister Hattie Jack Pennick as Capt. Dan Carroll Mickey Simpson as Jacques (wrestler/Marie's father) Fred Graham as Carter Ward Mabelle Koenig as Marie Hank Worden as Abner Todd (uncredited) Fred Aldrich as Militiaman (uncredited) Richard Alexander as Militiaman (uncredited) Hank Bell as Militiaman at Festival (uncredited)    Historical setting  The story is set in Alabama in 1818, including the city of Demopolis, which was founded by Bonapartists.  The Bonapartists had been exiled from France after the defeat of Napoleon I at the Battle of Waterloo.  Congress authorized the sale of four townships in the Alabama Territory in March 1817 at two dollars per acre, and Marengo County was created on February 7, 1818 from lands that had been taken from the Choctaw Nation under the Treaty of Fort St. Stephens.  It was named after Spinetta Marengo, Italy where Napoleon defeated Austria in 1800 in the Battle of Marengo.  The county seat, Linden, Alabama, was named after Hohenlinden, Bavaria where Napoleon won another victory against the Austrians.  The Bonapartist colony did not succeed overall, in part due to surveyance issues that contribute to the plot of the film and in part due to practical difficulties in establishing the vineyards.    Production notes  This is one of only five times that Hardy worked without partner Stan Laurel after they'd teamed up as Laurel and Hardy.  Hardy also appeared with Harry Langdon in Zenobia (1939), and in three cameos: Riding High, Barnum & Ringling, Inc. and Choo-Choo!  It was the only time that Hardy appeared in a film with John Wayne, though the two had worked together onstage a year earlier in a touring charity production of What Price Glory? starring Wayne, Ward Bond, and Maureen O'Hara, and directed by John Ford. Re-broadcast by Arte 1 February 2017, the film credits celebrated composer Georges Antheil (1900-1959) with the music (background score including among things stirring \"variations\" on the Marseillaise). The film was the second one produced by John Wayne for Republic Pictures. It was stuntman Chuck Roberson's first work with John Wayne; Roberson frequently doubled Wayne throughout his career. Wayne desired a French actress for the lead role and considered Danielle Darrieux, Simone Simon and Corinne Calvet but was forced to use Republic Studio's Vera Ralston causing other Czech and Austrian actors to be cast to match Ralston's accent. The Fighting Kentuckian was one of only four films in which John Wayne wore a buckskin suit with a coonskin cap, the others being the 1930 widescreen epic The Big Trail (in the Grand Canyon sequence shot on location), Allegheny Uprising (1939), and as Davy Crockett in the concluding battle footage in The Alamo (1960). Cleouna Moore (October 31, 1929 – October 25, 1973) was an American actress, usually featured in the role of a blonde bombshell in Hollywood films of the 1950s, including seven films with Hugo Haas. She also became a well-known pin-up girl.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCleouna Moore was born in 1929 in Galvez, Louisiana, and raised in nearby Gonzales. Her father ran a grocery store. She was educated in Gonzales public schools and took a secretarial course at Pope's Commercial College in Baton Rouge.\nShe married Palmer Long, the youngest child of Huey Long, the former governor of Louisiana who was assassinated while a Senator for Louisiana, but the marriage ended in six weeks. \nMoore was named Miss Van Nuys for 1947–1948.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe made her film debut in 1948 in Embraceable You. She also played the leading lady in the film serial Congo Bill and worked for Warner Brothers briefly in 1950. She worked for RKO Radio Pictures from 1950 to 1952, making such films as Hunt the Man Down and Gambling House.\nShe signed with Columbia Pictures in 1952. The studio had plans to mold Moore as its next film star, hoping she would bring Columbia the success that 20th Century-Fox was having with Marilyn Monroe. In order to compete with Monroe, Moore had to bleach her hair platinum blonde. Columbia dubbed her \"The Next Big Thing\" and \"The Blonde Rita Hayworth\". She first gained attention as a doomed gun moll in Nicholas Ray's film noir On Dangerous Ground in 1952.\nMoore began starring in films in 1952. In 1953, she made One Girl's Confession, opposite Hugo Haas, who directed and appeared with her in several other films. She co-starred in Thy Neighbor's Wife (1953) and Bait (1954), both directed by Haas, the latter co-starring John Agar.\nIn 1954, she starred in The Other Woman, playing a B-movie bit player who strikes at her movie director for revenge when he declines the offer for her to be in his picture. Upon completing a supporting role in Women's Prison (1955), Moore signed a brief deal with Universal Pictures to play a suicidal prostitute in the low-budget thriller Hold Back Tomorrow (1955), again opposite Agar.\nIn 1956, she starred as a predatory career girl in Over-Exposed, co-starring Richard Crenna. The following year, Moore made her final film appearance in Hit and Run (1957). After the release of the film, Moore retired from acting.\nDuring this period of 1950s Hollywood, Moore was one of several buxom blondes to achieve notability following Marilyn Monroe's major breakthrough; the others included Jayne Mansfield, Mamie Van Doren, Diana Dors, Sheree North, Anita Ekberg, Barbara Lang, Barbara Nichols, Joi Lansing, Carol Ohmart, Pat Sheehan, and Greta Thyssen.\n\n\n== Post Hollywood ==\nMoore found success as a businesswoman in real estate after her screen career ended.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAfter her six-week marriage to Palmer Long, Moore remained single through the 1940s and 1950s. In 1961, Moore married multi-millionaire real estate developer Herbert Heftler, and lived on an estate on Coldwater Canyon in Beverly Hills for the remaining 12 years of her life.\n\n\n== Death ==\nMoore died in 1973. She was either 44 or 49 years old. Her remains are buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery.\n\n\n== Partial filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n \nCleo Moore at IMDb\nThe Private Life and Times of Cleo Moore\nCleo Moore at AllMovie\nCleo Moore at Find a Grave The Human Jungle is a 1954 film noir crime film directed by Joseph M.

The Gregor siblings return home, where Don opens a book and retrieves a hidden revolver. As he prepares to leave, Don has a chance encounter with his father Dr. Boris Gregor, a famous plastic surgeon, at the front door. Boris then heads for the book safe and discovers that the revolver is missing. The scene shifts to a bar, where Don and Brady meet, and Don receives his share of the money for his role in a recent robbery. Brady then reminds his partner that they are going to rob the payroll of the Monterey Theatre, although Don has his doubts about the plan. Brady and Don break into the theater and ambush the nightwatchman, who is forced at gunpoint to open the safe but they are disturbed by Miss Willis, a bookkeeper who is leaving for the night, and Don shoots and kills the nightwatchman, while Brady shoots the fleeing woman in the back. Afterwards, Brady collects their loot while Don seems to be in shock over his own actions. The two criminals flee while police sirens are heard approaching the theatre. The two manage to escape the police, while at the theater it turns out that Miss Willis has survived the shooting, and she later identifies Don as the killer of the nightwatchman. Brady leads Don to the residence of his girlfriend, Loretta. Don leaves unnoticed, and Brady decides to search for him. The following night, Don visits his father's office and confesses the murder to him; Boris urges his son to surrender to the police. The guilt-ridden Don agrees to do so eventually and his father helps him escape the arriving police. While fleeing, Don is captured by Brady, who drives him back to Loretta's residence. They hear on the radio that they are both suspects for the robbery, although Don is wanted for murder. Don repeatedly expresses his decision to surrender and face the consequences of his actions. Fearing for his own safety, Brady kills his partner. He temporarily stores the corpse behind a curtain in the kitchen. At this point, Brady conceives a plan to elude the police by undergoing plastic surgery, and he contacts Boris, claiming that he is holding Don hostage until plastic surgery is completed. Boris decides to have Marilyn assist him, since she is a trained nurse. A few days later, Brady, Boris, Loretta, and Marilyn gather in preparation of the operation. Brady expresses his distrust of the Gregors and has to be convinced that anesthesia is necessary. With Brady sedated, Boris searches Loretta's kitchen for a water basin. He finds it, but also finds Don's stored corpse. He keeps this a secret and maintains a facade of calmness while performing the operation. He claims that the bandages covering Brady's face have to stay on for two weeks. Two weeks later, Brady and Loretta arrive at the Gregor residence on schedule, but so do Johns and Lawrence, who were both summoned by Boris. They want to know who the bandaged man is. When Brady's bandages are removed, his new face is revealed to be that of Don. Besides Boris, everyone else considers him to be the wanted murderer, and Boris claims that the man is his son. A horrified Brady attempts to flee and is killed in a shootout with the police. His dying body falls into a swimming pool.

He appeared in more than 60 films between 1926 and 1962, as well as directing 20 films between 1933 and 1962. Hugo Haas (19 February 1901 – 1 December 1968) was a Czech expatriate film actor, director and writer. He appeared in more than 60 films from 1926 to 1962 and directed 20 films from 1933 to 1962.    Life and career    Haas was born in Brno, Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic), and he died in Vienna, Austria from complications of asthma. He and his brother Pavel Haas studied voice at the Brno Conservatory under composer Leoš Janáček. Pavel Haas went on to become a noted composer before he was killed in Auschwitz in 1944.    Czechoslovak theater and film  After graduating from the conservatory in 1920, Hugo Haas began acting at the National Theater in Brno, in Ostrava and in Olomouc. In 1924, he moved to Prague and regularly appeared at the Vinohrady Theatre, where he remained until 1929. In 1930, Karel Hugo Hilar  made Haas a member of the Prague National Theatre drama company, where he remained until his emigration in 1939. One of his highly acclaimed roles was as Doctor Galén in The White Disease, which Karel Čapek had written especially for him. His final role at the National Theater was as Director Busman in Čapek's R.U.R. Haas made his film debut as Notary Voborský in the silent film Jedenácté přikázání (The Eleventh Commandment) in 1923. (Twelve years later he played the same role again in Jedenácté přikázání directed by Martin Frič.) With the advent of sound film, Haas was able to apply his comedic talent in Svatopluk Innemann's Muži v offsidu in 1931. By 1938 Haas had acted in some 30 films. In 1936, he directed his first film Camel Through the Eye of a Needle (co-directed with Otakar Vávra). He later directed Kvočna (the film score was composed by his brother Pavel), The White Disease and Co se šeptá. His final comedy in Czechoslovakia was Miroslav Cikán's Andula Won, which appeared in cinemas in 1938.    Emigration  Following the 1938 Munich Agreement and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in early 1939, Hugo Haas was dismissed from the National Theater due to his Jewish origin. In April he and his wife, Maria von Bibikoff fled via Paris and Spain and then from the port of Lisbon to the port of New York City in October–November 1940. Their son Ivan was taken in by his brother Pavel. Hugo Haas' father Lipmann (Zikmund) Haas and brother Pavel died at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.    United States  By the mid-1940s, Haas had become a character actor in American films. In 1951, he launched a successful if unacclaimed career as a film director in Hollywood with a string of B movie melodramas, usually starring blonde actresses in the role of a predatory mantrap. Haas usually cast himself as the male lead in the films, but the female role almost always dominated the storyline and was usually exclusively promoted on film posters. His work also includes the touching drama The Girl on the Bridge (1951) – which he co-wrote, directed and starred in – about a kindly watchmaker who after having lost his wife and family in the Holocaust, befriends, marries, and raises a second family with a young woman he saves from suicide. Cleo Moore starred in six films for Haas, becoming a well-known film star in that era. Other actresses who starred in Haas' films were Beverly Michaels and Carol Morris. The Haas pictures generally received poor reviews but were for the most part commercially successful, and on occasion, the films featured well-known names, including Eleanor Parker, John Agar, Vince Edwards, Rock Hudson, Joan Blondell, Agnes Moorehead, Julie London, Corinne Griffith, and Marie Windsor. Haas's final film Paradise Alley was rejected by the major studios and sat unreleased for over three years, finally surfacing in a limited run in 1962.    Production company  Haas's first American film was bankrolled out of his own pocket for $85,000. The financial success of Pickup led to the creation of the independent Hugo Haas Productions, which he used to produce 12 of his 14 American films from 1951 to 1959. Independent studios were not atypical at this time, but Haas' operating procedures were. He financed his own films, and the budgets were minuscule compared to most Hollywood fare.

It depicts the story of Garuda. The show stars Faisal Khan, Toral Rasputra and Parul Chauhan. It is produced by Contiloe Entertainment. The show aired from March 14, 2022 to December 10, 2022 on Sony SAB and digitally available on SonyLIV.    Plot   The story begins with Garud coming to meet his mother, Vinataa. They share a very good bond and have a great love for each other. Garud hates his Naag (Snake) Brothers and his maternal aunt Queen Kadru who ill-treats his mother Vinata. He always tries to know how his mother became Kadru's slave.  Vinata gets scared because of the snakes, especially Kaaliya, and Garud comes to save her and shows his ultimate power to the Snakes and Kadru. However, Vinata cools Garud. Vinata then teaches Garud how to stay calm and several important life lessons. Garud asks his mother how to reach Vaikunth, and she tells him. He goes there on the pretext of freeing his mother from slavery and knowing what actually happened. After a series of incidents, he encounters Shesh Naag, who tells him about Vinata and Kadru's past but doesn't know how Vinata became Kadru's slave. He tells him to meet Aditi Maa, the God's mother, to know what really happened. He goes there. He fights the Asura Army who came to kill Aditi Maa and succeeds. To save her children, Diti Maa promises to tell how Vinata became Kadru's slave. Garud goes back and asks Kadru if what she had done was right or not. Her children get angry, and a fight is started between Garud and the Snakes. As a punishment, Garud is made Kadru and her children's slaves. However, Rahu arrives and asks for Garud. Kadru denies to which Rahu retaliates by insulting Kadru. After seeing that Rahu is insulting their mother Takshaka, Kaaliya, and their brothers fight alongside Garud against Rahu and his army. Seeing this, Kadru orders Garud to take her to Maharaj Bali and tells her sons to take care of Garud's mother, Vinata. Rahu notices that Garud along with Kadru is flying away. He then divides himself into two, and one goes behind Garud to see where he is going. They meet Maharaj Bali and convince him to stop the war. The fight is stopped with Kadru praising her sons and Garud wondering why Kadru protected him. Garud is then given a task by Kadru: Get the Suryaphool. Garud, accompanied by his Brothers, accidentally reached Shani Loka, where he is tested and passed. Shani Dev gets angry at the Naag Brothers and they all fall down. Garud doesn't recognize any of the Naag Brothers falling down and gets the Suryaphool. Kadru gets angry and curses Garud. Vinata and Garud pray to Vishnu to prove Garud innocent. Vishnu awakes from his meditation and tells Garud that he will face a lot of trouble and that he will be a part of something big in his life. Lord Vishnu then tells Goddess Aditi, who is meditating, that good times will come again for the deities. Goddess Aditi comes to find Garuda who helped her, and with Kadru's approval, she goes with Garuda to find her children. Lord Vishnu tells about Samudra Manthana and Garuda lifting the Mandaraachal mountain and placing it in the ocean of milk. Here, Garuda gets his stepbrother, Vasuki Naag, to be the rope for Sagara Manthan. Gods and Asuras jointly perform these tasks and share the ratnas that descend there. During these events, a surprising event occurs in Vinata's household. Vinata went to the forest one day to collect firewood and met an old Baba who took him to her house and took care of him by giving him food. Later he proves to be sage Dattatreya and he blesses Vinata. At that time, signs of Lakshmi's arrival appear through Sagara Manthan. The arrival of Goddess Lakshmi takes place through the ocean, followed by the marriage of Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi. Aditi, Diti, Kadru and Vinata also participate in this. Vinata won everyone's favor there. Garuda's devotion is also praised by Lakshmi Narayan. The marriage ends and the Sagara manthana begins again where Amrita emerges. The Asuras, by trickery, steal the Amrit and the Devata's follow them. Uppalapati Surya Narayana Raju (13 December 1948 – 12 February 2010) was an Indian film producer.

Depicting African-American children as alligator bait was a common trope in American popular culture in the 19th and 20th centuries. The motif was present in a wide array of media, including newspaper reports, songs, sheet music, and visual art. There is an urban legend claiming that black children or infants were in fact used as bait to lure alligators, although there is no meaningful evidence that children of any race were ever used for this purpose. In American slang, alligator bait is a racial slur for African-Americans.    Popular culture  In the American popular imagination, black children were commonly used as bait for hunting alligators, which  are one of the central apex predators of the folklore of the United States, along with cougars, bears and wolves. The reasons for dubbing black babies \"alligator bait\" are unknown, but the identification may be a consequence of earlier associations of African crocodiles—a relative of American alligators—with Africa and its people. Gators largely live in the swamplands of the Southern United States, which were one place people escaping enslavement hid to evade capture. According to popular legend, enslaved people who disappeared in swamps may have been killed by alligators; children were understood as particularly vulnerable to attacks by alligators, and that identification may have evolved into the bait image. Alligator lore draws from \"a shared dread of these reptilian creatures that come out of the water to eat dogs and children.\" The alligator bait image is a subtype of the racist pickaninny caricature and stereotype of black children, where they were represented as almost unhuman, filthy, unlovable, unkempt, \"unsupervised and dispensible.\" In 19th and 20th century American popular media, stereotyped depictions of black children were common:  [Black children in popular media had] wide toothy grins, rolling white eyes, shiny dark faces, and uncontrollably kinky hair...Supportive props [included] watermelon, bales of cotton, and alligators...The more vicious scenes devalued black children's lives to the extent that entrepreneurs claimed they were 'dainty morsel,' 'free lunches' or 'gator bait' for carnivorous reptiles.  Drawings of black babies luring alligators were printed by companies like Underwood & Underwood on postcards, cigar boxes, and sheet music covers, The trope also appeared in films and in paintings. The sheet music drawings were almost purely symbolic; the images of black children being hunted by alligators were not represented in almost any corresponding music, though other songs (without the iconography) did have alligator bait as a component. In general, the drawings reinforced the racist belief that black people were victims to nature, and that their race made it reasonable to assume they should die terribly. Alligator-bait-themed postcards and greeting cards were part of a larger genre of anti-black racist ephemera known as coon cards. American Mutoscope and Biograph Company produced a pair of short films in 1900 called The 'Gator and the Pickaninny and Alligator Bait. In the former, \"a black man with an ax unhesitatingly attacks an alligator that has swallowed a small black boy; as a result, the boy, Jonah-like, is restored.\" In the latter, according to the film-company catalog, \"A little colored baby is tied to a post on a tropical shore. A huge 'gator comes out of the water, and is about to devour the little pickaninny, when a hunter appears and shoots the reptile.\" Due to the popularity of the idea, letter openers were manufactured in designs resembling alligators, some of which came equipped with small replicas of black children's heads to be placed in the alligator's mouth.  The title \"Alligator Bait\" for an 1897 collage of nine African-American babies posed \"on a sandy bayou\" was supposedly suggested by a hardware-store employee in Knoxville, Tennessee as part of a naming contest with a cash prize. By 1900, the photo had sold 11,000 copies and brought in US$5,000 (equivalent to about $183,120 in 2023) for McCrary & Branson. In 1964, a New Jersey editorial writer recalled a copy of the photo—meant to \"elicit an amused appreciation\"—that had once hung in a local shop. The newspaper editor described the image as \"immoral\" and equivalent to \"viciously pornographic pictures.\" American studies professor Jay Mechling concludes his essay (about how alligators are used in cultural messaging) on a similar note:  To discover the ways in which these symbols and stories carry anti-female and anti-black meanings is to see the ideology packed into our most taken-for-granted attitudes toward the world. Bait is a 1954 American film noir drama film, written, directed and produced by Hugo Haas. Haas himself, Cleo Moore and John Agar starred in the film. == Plot ==\nMiddle-aged Marko is searching for his gold mine, the entrance to which has been lost for nearly 20 years, at which time his partner died, a death for which some locals think he is to blame.\nTo share expenses for a prospecting expedition he teams up with bright young Ray Brighton. When they find the mine, Marko decides he doesn't want to share with his partner and plans to murder him. He proposes to Peggy, a young widow with a baby to whom he knows Ray is attracted, and who Marko and the local people prefer to label as a 'fallen woman'.  Marko tells her he is sorry he misjudged her, and she eventually accepts his proposal in order to obtain security for her child.\nIt beings to look as though Marko only wanted Peggy as an unpaid worker, but he also encourages her and Ray to be friendly, even to dance together, and some months later, at Christmas, Ray suggests that they split the gold three ways, since Peggy works just as hard as he and Marko do. Later, Marko says he forgot to get salt on the last trip into town, and that he will go for it the next day, returning the day after. While he is away, Ray and Peggy keep working, but also enjoy their evening together playing cards and talking. Ray tells Peggy he loves her but she says although she feels the same, she cannot betray Marko, to which Ray agrees. He goes to get some more tobacco, and finds a bag of salt where Marko hid it.  He then spots a slightly melted spot in the ice on the windows, and realises Marko had been spying on them. Marko then bursts into the cabin, but Ray has hidden behind the door and knocks a weapon from Marko's hand. Ray says he now understands that Marko had deliberately pushed them together, then pretended to go into town so that he could come back unexpectedly, hoping to catch them in adultery, so he can use the \"unwritten law\" to kill Brighton and thus escape punishment from the law.  Ray and Peggy pack up their things, and, leaving Marko his share of the gold, start off to walk to the highway and safety. As they leave, Marko lunges at Ray with a knife, but Ray pushes him away; Marko tries to get up, but realises he has broken his leg and that he will not survive the winter in the cabin on his own, an echo of the death of his previous partner.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nCleo Moore as Peggy\nHugo Haas as Marko\nJohn Agar as Ray Brighton\nEmmett Lynn as Foley\nBruno VeSota as Webb\nJan Englund as Waitress\nGeorge Keymas as Chuck\nCedric Hardwicke as Prologue Speaker Kovelamudi Surya Prakash Rao (1914–1996) was an Indian film director, producer, actor and cinematographer known for his works in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Hindi films.

She threatens her father to commit suicide in case Vasishta does not authorize the project and tell his story. After several comical pleadings of her father, the reluctant Vashshta budges and goes down the memory to narrate his story of how he won over his love interest Sahasra. In 1996, Vasishta and Sahasra met at a wedding, and it is love at first sight for both of them. The main obstacle to their union is Sahasra's father Pattabhi Ramayya, the strict family patriarch who is completely against love marriage. How Vasishta convinces the headstrong father and proves that he is a worthy match for his daughter forms the rest of the story.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was planned in October 2020 as sequel to 1996 film Pelli Sandadi that starred Srikanth, Ravali and Deepti Bhatnagar. K. Raghavendra Rao decided to supervise the direction of the sequel with  Gowri Ronanki making her directorial debut. Incidentally Srikanth's elder son, Roshan Meka, was selected to play the male lead in the sequel. \nInitially, it was reported that actor Sridevi's daughter Khushi Kapoor would be the female lead opposite Roshan, but it was not finalized. In October 2020, actress Malavika Nair was signed to pair opposite Meka, but she was later replaced by Sreeleela in January 2021. Filming was completed in July 2021, and post-production began in the same month.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was initially planned for release in September 2021, but was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic in India.

But don't expect anything fresh or remotely logical.\" Y Sunita Chowdhary of The Hindu felt that \"the film is a Manmohan Desai style of ending with a battle between the divine and the evil where a young, small-built Roshan has a showdown with big-bodied men amidst spears, colour and a Hanuman idol. The film can be touted as a costly showreel for Roshan and Sree Leela\". Eenadu stated that soundtrack and performance of lead actors are the positives, and, screenplay, story and first-half are the negatives of the film. A reviewer of NTV criticized film's screenplay and felt that it has an outdated story.

The inferior papal armies, commanded by Giovanni de' Medici, try to  chase them in the midst of a harsh winter. Nevertheless, the Imperial armies manage to cross the rivers along their march and get cannons thanks to the maneuvers of its Lords.\nIn a skirmish, Giovanni de' Medici is wounded in the leg by a falconet shot. The attempts to cure him fail and he dies. The Imperial armies assault Rome.\nThe film is beautifully but unassumingly set, and shows the hard conditions in which war is waged and its lack of glory.

He made his feature film debut with the critically acclaimed neo-noir gangster film Aaranya Kaandam (2011), which earned him the Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director at the 59th National Film Awards.\n\n\n== Career ==\nThiagarajan Kumararaja was born and raised in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. His parents thought he would pick up bad habits if he stepped out, so he stayed mostly at home. He likes books of Sujatha, Rajesh Kumar, Kovi Manisekaran & Sandilyan. But the real entertainment was the bus ride from his home in Porur to Santhome Higher Secondary School. He used to stand next to the driver, observing the driver. \"I wanted to be a PTC bus driver,\" he says. At the Class XII failed in Mathematics subject. On his words \"If I didn’t like the teacher, I wouldn’t study.\"\nHe enrolled for a Visual Communications course at the Loyola College, Chennai, but dropped out shortly after to make films. Kumararaja cited that it was composer Ilaiyaraaja's music that animated him to come to films and to study Visual Communications in the first place. However, he discontinued his studies in 1998 and started to work as a freelance copywriter and photographer for a while. He went on to shoot advertisement films and also directed a five-part documentary on South Indian Temples, Sthala Puranam for Vijay TV. In 2005, he participated at the one-minute film competition 60 Seconds to Fame by Ability Foundation, aiming for the prize money. His short film Becky was awarded the first prize at the Ability Fest 2005. Kumararaja then collaborated with Pushkar-Gayathri, writing the dialogue of their directorial debut Oram Po (2007). He also wrote song lyrics for their second project Va (2010) as well. Through Pushkar-Gayathri, Kumararaja met S. P. B. Charan, who agreed to produce his first feature film Aaranya Kaandam.\nKumararaja began writing his maiden film in December 2006. Although he had wanted to make a \"racy film\" – he wrote the climax part first, before going on to add multiple storylines – he said that the film had eventually turned out to be a \"leisurely paced film, taking its own time to unfold\". Kumararaja met Charan in January 2007 and narrated him the script for two hours. Filming was supposed to commence by late 2007, but Charan opted to produce another film first. Aaranya Kaandam was launched in December 2008, starring Ravi Krishna and Sampath Raj, with Bollywood actor Jackie Shroff, who was being introduced to Tamil films. Kumararaja took more than one and a half years to complete the film, which was entirely shot in and around Chennai. Upon completion, the film ran into trouble when the regional censor board in Chennai refused to clear it, demanding 52 cuts due to profanity and excessive violence. Kumararaja expressed that he made the film for a matured audience and not for children, while adding that he expected difficulties in the censorship. Since he wanted to present the film uncompromisingly to the audiences, he and Charan approached the Central Tribunal at Delhi, that cleared the film. Dubbed as the first neo-noir film in Tamil cinema, Aaranya Kaandam opened to strong critical acclaim, winning the Grand Jury Award for Best Film at the 2010 South Asian International Film Festival, and two prizes at the 59th National Film Awards, including the Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director for Kumararaja.\nIn 2015, he was involved as a script consultant for the Tamil film Yennai Arindhaal, which was co-written and directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\nAs Other \n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThiagarajan Kumararaja at IMDb Dhruvasangamam (transl. Poles adjoin) is a 1981 Indian Malayalam-language drama film directed by J.

The film was shown as a Special Screening at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. It received the Critics Award at the 2007 David di Donatello Awards and was nominated in eight more categories, including Best Film. == Reception ==\nVariety's Jay Weissberg called the film \"disappointing\" and wrote: \"In many ways, One Hundred Nails harks back to Olmi's earliest films, with a touch of Pasolini, evident not only in the locations but also the largely nonpro cast. Fabio Olmi's lensing repeatedly returns to the river's calm, presenting a timeless land of purer values than those of the city, though lacking the richness of his last two pics with father Ermanno.\" Geoff Andrew of Time Out London described it as \"a bizarre, elegant gem\", and wrote: \"Not unlike a latterday, more effective Miracle in Milan, this profoundly Catholic, profoundly personal fable veers, like many Olmi films, between the seemingly inept and the spellbindingly innocent, magical in its tenderness, its striking visuals and its unpredictability.

Aaranya Kaandam (transl. Jungle Chapter; English title: Anima and Persona) is a 2010 Indian Tamil-language gangster film written and directed by Thiagarajan Kumararaja in his directorial debut. It is supposedly the first neo-noir film in Tamil cinema. The plot takes place in a day in the lives of the six protagonists, played by Jackie Shroff, Ravi Krishna, Sampath Raj and debutants Yasmin Ponnappa, Guru Somasundaram and Master Vasanth. Produced by S. P. B. Charan's Capital Film Works, the musical score of the film was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, cinematography by P. S. Vinod and editing handled by the duo Praveen K. L.-N. B. Srikanth. The film was launched on 18 December 2008, with its principal photography being completed by late 2009, which was followed by a lengthy post-production phase. It ran into difficulties as the regional censor board in Chennai raised objection against the film, giving it an adult rating besides demanding 52 cuts. After screening and becoming approved by the Tribunal in Delhi, the film was released worldwide on 10 June 2011, where it received critical acclaim from critics, but underperformed at box-office. Despite its failure, it gained recognition over the years, and is now regarded as a cult film in Tamil and Indian cinema. Aaranya Kaandam had its world premiere on 30 October 2010 at the South Asian International Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury Award for Best Film. Subsequently, the film was honoured with two National Film Awards for Best Editing and Best First Film of a Director category respectively.    Plot  Singaperumal is an aged gangster, who forces himself on a girl named Subbu, but is unable to perform and vents his frustration by slapping her. Later, his right hand man Pasupathy tells him that a large stash of cocaine worth ₹20,000,000 (US$240,000), has entered the city. The man bringing the stash wants to sell it for ₹5,000,000 (US$60,000). Pasupathy sees the profit, the long-term benefit (to control the cocaine market with such an ample supply), and the recognition if they are able to pull off such a deal. The drawback is that the stash belongs to their arch-rival Gajendran. Singaperumal knows that Gajendran is a vicious and unpredictable adversary and that the venture is risky, so he decides to pass. Pasupathy suggests that Singaperumal is getting old and asks him to loan him ₹5,000,000 (US$60,000) so he can do the job himself. Pasupathy is prepared to face the risks, and in return for the loan, he offers Singaperumal a cut of the profits. Singaperumal agrees to the loan, but instead asks Pasupathy to first get the stash and then think of the profit distribution. Kaalayan is a destitute farmer, living with his young, street-smart son Kodukapuli in the slums and earns a meagre living staging cockfights; coincidentally, Singaperumal loves to watch these cockfights. One evening, a man arrives in a bunk with Kaalayan for the night. The man is actually the cocaine courier, who routinely transports various stashes of drugs in and out of the city and collects a relatively small fee ₹10,000 (US$120) for each trip. That evening, after a long bout of drinking, he reveals that he has learnt the actual value of the stash and now intends to sell it himself. Seeing Subbu in tears, Singaperumal asks one of his men Sappai to take her out and comfort her so she is prepared to perform for him at night. Sappai takes her to the beach and tries to console her. Pasupathy and the men meet with the tipster and drive off to retrieve the stash. En route in the car, one of the men receives a call from Singaperumal, who orders him to bump off Pasupathy as soon as the stash is acquired. Pasupathy overhears this and gets into a Mexican stand-off with others. In a desperate ploy, he deliberately provokes a cop at a checkpoint, getting arrested and then later making an escape. The men kidnap his wife Kasthuri and use her as bait to lure Pasupathy. Singaperumal orders them to bring Kasthuri to him. Meanwhile, Subbu hates being a plaything for Singaperumal and wants to live life on her own terms. She tries to persuade Sappai to think for himself and realise that Singaperumal is using them.

After disagreeing with TVT about how to promote the album, the band signed with Interscope Records and released the EP Broken (1992). The following albums, The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Following a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album With Teeth (2005). Following the release of the next album Year Zero (2007), the band left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released Ghosts I–IV (2008) and The Slip (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, Hesitation Marks (2013), was followed by a trilogy which consisted of the EPs Not the Actual Events (2016) and Add Violence (2017) and their ninth album Bad Witch (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails simultaneously released two further installments in the Ghosts series: Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts. When touring, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him under the Nine Inch Nails name. This live band has varied over the decades, with various members leaving and returning; the most recent lineup consists of Robin Finck (who initially joined in 1994), Alessandro Cortini (who initially joined in 2005), and Ilan Rubin (who initially joined in 2008) alongside Reznor and Ross. The band's concerts are noted for their extensive use of thematic visual elements, complex special effects, and elaborate lighting. Songs are often rearranged to fit any given performance, and melodies or lyrics of songs that are not scheduled to be performed are sometimes assimilated into other songs. Nine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning for the songs \"Wish\" in 1992 and \"Happiness in Slavery\" in 1996. Time magazine named Reznor one of its most influential people in 1997, while Spin magazine has described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, Rolling Stone placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Nine Inch Nails were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020, after being nominated in 2014 (their first year of eligibility) and again in 2015.    History     Formation (1987–1988)   While living in Cleveland in 1987, Trent Reznor played keyboards in the Exotic Birds, a synthpop band managed by John Malm Jr.: 38  Reznor became friends with Malm, who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music. At the time, Reznor was employed as an assistant engineer and janitor at Right Track Studios. Studio owner Bart Koster granted Reznor free access to the studio between bookings to record demos, commenting that it cost him nothing more than \"a little wear on [his] tape heads\". Unable to find a band that could articulate the material as he desired, Reznor was inspired by Prince to play all instruments himself except drums, which he programmed electronically. He has continued to play most parts on Nine Inch Nails recordings ever since. The first Nine Inch Nails performance took place at the Phantasy Theater in Lakewood, Ohio, on October 21, 1988. Soon after, following their live support of Skinny Puppy, Reznor aimed to release one 12-inch single on a small European label. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine demos, recorded live in November 1988 and collectively known as Purest Feeling, were released in revised form on the first studio album, Pretty Hate Machine (1989).: 41  The overall sound on Purest Feeling is lighter than that of Pretty Hate Machine; several songs contain more live drumming and guitar, as well as a heavier use of film samples. Reznor chose the name \"Nine Inch Nails\" because it \"abbreviated easily\" rather than for \"any literal meaning\". Other rumored explanations have circulated, alleging that Reznor chose to refer to Jesus's crucifixion with nine-inch spikes,: 57  or Freddy Krueger's nine-inch fingernails. G.

He has won Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut – South for his performance in that movie.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAfter his schooling, Ravi Krishna went to London where he pursued a BA degree in Multimedia. He completed his diploma in Interactive communication at Pentamedia, while also concentrating on his career in multimedia with non-linear film editing at Sam Media. He disclosed that he never intended to become an actor, but was \"roped in\" when he visited India for Easter.\n\n\n== Career ==\nRavi Krishna's debut film 7G Rainbow Colony, directed by Selvaraghavan and produced by his father, fetched him the South Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut, amongst other minor awards. Before starting to shoot for the film, he took a one-month training in acting at the Film Institute in King's College London. Following that, he acted in S. A. Chandrasekhar's Sukran, sharing screen space with Vijay, the Radha Mohan-directed family drama Ponniyin Selvan, and the action-masala flick Kedi, under his brother Jyothi Krishna's direction. The films, all produced by his father, received poor reviews and did not do good business at the box office. His first Telugu venture, Brahmanandam Drama Company, was also a box office bomb, with Ravi Krishna lamenting that the film failed to succeed due to poor budgeting and publicity. His next release was the bilingual Netru Indru Naalai / Ninna Nedu Repu and in 2009, he starred in Kadhalna Summa Illai, a partial reshoot of the Telugu film Gamyam. Aaranya Kaandam, termed as the first neo-noir film in Tamil cinema was his last film, before he took a 13-year hiatus from acting. He is currently filming for 7G Rainbow Colony 2, a sequel to his debut film, 7G Rainbow Colony (2004).\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRavi Krishna at IMDb Ermanno Olmi( 24 July 1931 – 7 May 2018) was an Italian film director and screenwriter. Ermanno Olmi (24 July 1931 – 7 May 2018) was an Italian film director and screenwriter best known for directing Il Posto (1961) and The Tree of Wooden Clogs (1977), which won the Palme d'Or. Throughout his career Olmi blended Italian neorealism with Christian humanism, with many of his films following humble characters through the spiritual trials of harsh conditions.    Early life  Olmi was born to a working-class Catholic family in Bergamo, in the Lombardy region in northern Italy, and raised in nearby Treviglio. When Olmi was three years old, his family moved to Milan, where his parents found work with the utility company Edison-Volta. At age 16, Olmi began working there as a messenger. Olmi was initially interested in architecture, but was inspired to pursue cinema by the works of Roberto Rossellini. He began taking art classes and convinced Edison-Volta to start a documentary division. As head of the new division, Olmi made as many as 40 corporate documentaries. Olmi's first feature film, Time Stood Still began as a corporate documentary about a hydroelectric dam.    Career  Olmi's first scripted film was the acclaimed Il Posto, which follows a young man entering corporate life. Parts of the story were drawn from Olmi's experiences working in Milan. The film starred non-professional actor Loredana Detto, who Olmi would later marry. Following from his humble start in corporate documentaries, Olmi typically helmed minimal productions, often writing, directing, filming, and editing the films himself. Perhaps his best known film is The Tree of Wooden Clogs (L'Albero degli zoccoli), which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival. The film drew heavily on Olmi's grandmother's stories about peasant life in agricultural regions of Italy. In 1983 his film Walking, Walking was screened out of competition at Cannes. In 1988, his La leggenda del santo bevitore (The Legend of the Holy Drinker), based on the novella by Joseph Roth and starring Rutger Hauer, won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival as well as a David di Donatello award. In 1982, Olmi founded Ipotesi Cinema, a film school in the village of Bassano del Grappa. His The Profession of Arms (Il mestiere delle armi) also won a David di Donatello award.

In 2019, the Austrian Film Museum conducted a complete retrospective of Olmi's work (excluding only his short films) – together with the films of Federico Fellini – in collaboration with the Cineteca Nazionale and the \"Istituto Italiano di Cultura di Vienna\". Also in 2019, Film at Lincoln Center honored Olmi with a two-week retrospective. The series was co-produced by Istituto Luce Cinecittà and presented in association with the Ministry of Culture of Italy. The films then traveled to Cleveland, where the Cleveland Institute of Art Cinematheque hosted a seven-part retrospective. In 2008 he received the Honorary Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. He had turned down the same award in 2004, feeling that it would have signified a premature end to his career.    Personal life  In 1959, Olmi moved to the Asiago plateau, where he would live for the rest of his life.

The formula has been revised repeatedly to enhance its decorative properties, to be safer for the consumer to use, and to suppress cracking or peeling. Nail polish consists of a mix of an organic polymer and several other components that give it colors and textures. Nail polishes come in all color shades and play a significant part in manicures and pedicures.    History  Nail polish originated in China and dates back to 3000 BCE. Around 600 BCE, during the Zhou dynasty, the royal house preferred the colors gold and silver. However, red and black eventually replaced these metallic colors as royal favorites. During the Ming dynasty, nail polish was often made from a mixture that included beeswax, egg whites, gelatin, vegetable dyes, and gum arabic. In Egypt, the lower classes wore pale colors of nail polish, whereas high society painted their nails a reddish brown with henna. Mummified pharaohs also had their nails painted with henna. In Europe, Frederick S. N. Douglas, while traveling in Greece in 1810–1812, noticed that the Greek women used to paint their nails \"dingy pink\", which he understood as an ancient custom.  Early nail polish formulas were created using basic ingredients such as lavender oil, carmine, oxide tin, and bergamot oil. It was more common to polish nails with tinted powders and creams, finishing off by buffing the nail until left shiny. One type of polishing product sold around this time was Graf's Hyglo nail polish paste. In Victorian era culture it was generally considered improper for women to adorn themselves with either makeup or nail coloring, since natural appearances were considered more chaste and pure. In the 1920s, however, women began to wear color in new makeups and nail products, partly in rebellion to such prim customs of their recent past. In 1920s France, a big pioneer of nail polish was the hairstylist Antoine de Paris, whose cosmetic company produced some of the first modern polishes, and he himself shocked the newspapers by wearing each nail painted a different color. Since the 1920s, nail colors progressed from French manicures and standard reds to various palettes of color choices, usually coordinated with the fashion industry's clothing colors for the season. By the 1940s the whole nail was painted; before that, it was fashionable to leave the tips and a half-moon on the nail bed bare.    Ingredients   Modern nail polish consists predominately of a film-forming polymer dissolved in a volatile organic solvent. The most common polymer is nitrocellulose, although the more expensive cellulose acetates such as CAB are claimed to give better performance. In gel nail varnish, the polymer is usually some sort of acrylate copolymer. The solvents are commonly butyl acetate or ethyl acetate. Low levels of various additives are included to give the desired finish:  Plasticizers to yield non-brittle films. diethylphthalate, dibutylphthalate and camphor are typical. Dyes and pigments. Representative compounds include chromium oxide greens, chromium hydroxide, ferric ferrocyanide, stannic oxide, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, carmine, ultramarine, and manganese violet. Opalescent pigments. The glittery/shimmer look in the color can be conferred by mica, bismuth oxychloride, natural pearls, and aluminum powder. Adhesive polymers ensure that the nitrocellulose adheres to the nail's surface. One modifier used is tosylamide-formaldehyde resin. Thickening agents are added to maintain the sparkling particles in suspension while in the bottle. A typical thickener is stearalkonium hectorite. Thickening agents exhibit thixotropy, their solutions are viscous when still but free-flowing when agitated. This duality is convenient for easily applying the freshly shaken mixture to give a film that quickly rigidifies. Ultraviolet stabilizers resist color changes when the dry film is exposed to sunlight. A typical stabilizer is benzophenone-1.    Types     Base coat   This type of nail polish is a clear, milky-colored, or opaque pink polish formula that is used specifically before applying nail polish to the nail. Its function is to strengthen nails, restore moisture to the nail, and help polish adhere to the nail. It prevents staining and extends the lifespan of the manicure. Some base coats are marketed as \"ridge fillers\", and can create a smooth surface, de-emphasizing the ridges that can appear on unbuffed nails.

Generally, nails have a sharp point on one end and a flattened head on the other, but headless nails are available. Nails are made in a great variety of forms for specialized purposes. The most common is a wire nail. Other types of nails include pins, tacks, brads, spikes, and cleats. Nails are typically driven into the workpiece by a hammer or nail gun. A nail holds materials together by friction in the axial direction and shear strength laterally. The point of the nail is also sometimes bent over or clinched after driving to prevent pulling out.    History   The history of the nail is divided roughly into three distinct periods:   Hand-wrought (forged) nail (pre-history until 19th century) Cut nail (roughly 1800 to 1914) Wire nail (roughly 1860 to the present) From the late 1700s to the mid-1900s, nail prices fell by a factor of 10; since then nail prices have increased slightly, reflecting in part an upturn in materials prices and a shift toward specialty nails.    Hand wrought   In hand-working of nails, a smith works an approximately conical iron pin tapering to a point. This is then inserted into a nail-header (also known as a nail-plate), essentially a plate of iron with a small hole in it. The broad end of the pin is slightly wider than the hole of the nail-header: the smith fits the pin into the hole of the nail-header and then hammers the broad end of the pin. Unable to advance through the hole, the broad end is flattened against the nail-header to create a nail-head. In at least some metalworking traditions, nail-headers might have been identical to draw-plates (a plate bored with tapering holes of different sizes through which wire can be drawn to extrude it to increasingly fine proportions). The Bible provides a number of references to nails, including the story in Judges of Jael the wife of Heber, who drives a nail (or tent-peg) into the temple of a sleeping Canaanite commander; the provision of iron for nails by King David for what would become Solomon's Temple; and in connection with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. The Romans made extensive use of nails. The Roman army, for example, left behind seven tons of nails when it evacuated the fortress of Inchtuthil in Perthshire in Scotland in 86 to 87 CE. The term \"penny\", as it refers to nails, probably originated in medieval England to describe the price of a hundred nails. Nails themselves were sufficiently valuable and standardized to be used as an informal medium of exchange. Until around 1800 artisans known as nailers or nailors made nails by hand – note the surname Naylor. (Workmen called slitters cut up iron bars to a suitable size for nailers to work on. From the late 16th century, manual slitters disappeared with the rise of the slitting mill, which cut bars of iron into rods with an even cross-section, saving much manual effort.) At the time of the American Revolution, England was the largest manufacturer of nails in the world. Nails were expensive and difficult to obtain in the American colonies, so that abandoned houses were sometimes deliberately burned down to allow recovery of used nails from the ashes. This became such a problem in Virginia that a law was created to stop people from burning their houses when they moved. Families often had small nail-manufacturing setups in their homes; during bad weather and at night, the entire family might work at making nails for their own use and for barter. Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter: \"In our private pursuits it is a great advantage that every honest employment is deemed honorable. I am myself a nail maker.\" The growth of the trade in the American colonies was theoretically held back by the prohibition of new slitting mills in America by the Iron Act of 1750, though there is no evidence that the Act was actually enforced. The production of wrought-iron nails continued well into the 19th century, but ultimately was reduced to nails for purposes for which the softer cut nails were unsuitable, including horseshoe nails.    Cut  The slitting mill, introduced to England in 1590, simplified the production of nail rods, but the real first efforts to mechanise the nail-making process itself occurred between 1790 and 1820, initially in England and the United States, when various machines were invented to automate and speed up the process of making nails from bars of wrought iron. Also in Sweden in the early 1700s Christopher Polhem produced a nail cutting machine as part of his automated factory. Nambiathusseril Varkey John( 14 October 1927 – 17 July 2014), better known by his screen name Sasikumar, was an Indian film director who worked in Malayalam cinema. One of the most prolific directors in world cinema, he has directed more than 141 films in his career which began in the mid-1960s. He is often referred to as Hitmaker Sasikumar due to the commercial success of his films. Sasikumar holds three world records: the records for most films( 141), most films having the same actor as hero( Prem Nazir in 84 films) and the most films directed in a year( 15 films in 1977). He died in 2014 at the age of 86. Nambiathusseril Varkey John (14 October 1927 – 17 July 2014), better known by his screen name Sasikumar, was an Indian film director who worked in Malayalam cinema. He has directed more than 141 films in his career which began in the mid-1960s. He is often referred to as Hitmaker Sasikumar due to the commercial success of his films. In 2012, he was awarded the J. C. Daniel Award, Kerala government's highest honour for contributions to Malayalam cinema Sasikumar holds record for directing most films (141) after Telugu film director Dasari Narayana Rao (151), most films having the same actor as hero Prem Nazir in 84 films and the most films directed in a year, 15 films in 1977. He died in 2014 at the age of 86.    Early life  He was born on 14 October 1927 to N L Varkey and Mariya in Allappuzha, Kerala. He had displayed a great flair for acting in dramas even when he was a boy of 10. He completed his school education from Leo Thirteenth High school, Alleppey and St. Ephrem's School, Mannanam. During his college life he had represented Kerala University football team. He passed out as a graduate in economics from Sacred Hearts College, Thevara.    Career     Early work  During his studies in the schools and colleges, he had acted in dramas of the Shakespearean genre. Later on, Kunchacko of Udaya Studios, Alleppey, identified his talent and gave him a role to act in his film Visappinte Vili in which he acted as villain against the Evergreen Hero, Prem Nazir. This happened to be the first film in Malayalam in which a villain fights with the hero without a dupe and that role was performed with aplomb by Sasikumar. Subsequently, in addition to acting in several films produced by Udaya Studios he worked as the assistant director of Kunchacko in those films. Later on, he joined Merryland Studios, owned by the veteran director-producer P. Subramaniam. It was under his tutelage that Sasikumar was transformed into a great director. While in Merryland he worked with many renowned actors of that time, including T. K. Balachandran, Prem Nazir and Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair. He worked as associate director to P. Subramaniam in addition to acting in some roles himself. Sasikumar still considers P.Subramanyam as a fatherly icon who had showered upon him fatherly affection and regards during his tenure at Merryland. The first independent film directed by Sasikumar was a documentary, namely ONAKKAZHCHA for Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Limited (FACT) regarding the use and effectiveness of fertilizers in agriculture.    Peak years  Following the advice of his friend Prem Nazir, Sasikumar went to Chennai in the 1960s. He directed Thommante Makkal and Porter Kunjali for Thomas Pictures in 1965. He also directed, along with P. A. Thomas, the movie Kudumbini (1964) for Thomas Pictures, which received a Certificate of Merit at the annual National Film Awards. Subsequently, he directed an art film,  Kavalam Chundan, which was a flop. As a result, a dejected Sasikumar decided to give up film direction and return to Kerala to join his father's oil mill business. It was Prem Nazir who encouraged him to return to Chennai where he directed the commercial film Jeevitha Yaathra which became a major hit. After this, Sasikumar understood that he could not make an art film like Kavalam Chundan with producers' money. But after his change of style from art to commercial films he never looked back. Along with Prem Nazir he helped many producers who had lost their land and jewellery through movie production. Sathyan, Prem Nazir, Adoor Bhasi, S. P. Pillai, Madhu, Jose Prakash, Sheela, Vijayasree, K.R.Vijaya, Sharada, Vidhubala, Lakshmi, Sreelatha, Jayabharathi, Sreevidya, Nanditha Bose, Unni Mary, Kamal Haasan, Mammootty, Sukumaran, Soman, Ravikumar, Jayan, Vincent, Sobhana, Shankar, Mohanlal and Suresh Gopi all acted in his films. Neranja Manasu (transl. Big heart) is a 2004 Indian Tamil-language action drama film written and directed by Samuthirakani. It stars Vijayakanth and newcomer Susan. The music is composed by Karthik Raja, while cinematography is by V. Prathap and editing by Anil Malnad. The film was released on 11 November 2004, and did not perform well at the box office.    Plot  In Suryakudi, a village in Madurai district, the people stole from neighbouring villages and made a living. The local administration had washed their hands off this hell hole. One day, the thief Irulaiah escaped from the police and left his pregnant wife. Many years later, Irulaiah returned to his village with his new wife and daughter Irulayi. His son Sivanandi killed him to steal his money and his wife died while trying to save him. His cousin Ayyanar, who witnessed it, informed the police and Sivanandi was arrested. 20 years later, Ayyanar is a good samaritan who tries his best to improve the living of the villagers and he is highly respected by his peers. After being released from jail, a vengeful Sivanandi returns to his village and wants to kill his cousin Ayyanar. Meanwhile, Irulayi who is in love with Ayyanar tries to woo him and the new village doctor also likes him. The village woman Thavamani finds out that the funds meant for the development of the village are being shared by the local bureaucracy led by revenue divisional officer Thirumalaisamy and informs Ayyanar. Thirumalaisamy then murders the innocent Thavamani and a vengeful Ayyanar kills him. Inspector Adithya inquiries the villagers about the murder at the police station and knows that Ayyanar is the culprit. A short-tempered Ayyanar slaps Adithya for threatening the village women and a villager sets the police station on fire and Adithya is disfigured. Later, Sivanandi asks his friend Masanam to marry his sister Irulayi but Ayyanar comes to her rescue and beats up Masanam. Sivanandi joins hands with Masanam and Adithya to kill Ayyanar. During a fight, Sivanandi is frustrated for not being able to kill Ayyanar and Ayyanar convinces him to become a good man thus Sivanandi has a change of heart. Ayyanar then beats up Masanam and Adithya. The film ends with the collector Venkatraman announcing that the funds will be given to the villagers.    Cast     Production  After securing Vijayakanth's dates, the producers at GJ Cinema first approached Ramana to direct the film. Ramana finalised a script titled Parthasarathy, but the makers opted to change their choice of director to N. Lingusamy, who also later opted out. Samuthirakani later took on the responsibility, using a different script. Sampath Raj appeared in his first acting role and portrayed two different characters. Meera Vasudevan had met Vijayakanth for a role in the film. The film was largely shot in a village near Pollachi, including at Mazhai Vendi Ayyanar temple. The film crew got the permission of villagers to repair a broken temple chariot and made the chariot ready to run for the shoot.    Soundtrack  Music was composed by Karthik Raja and released on Mass Audios. Halitha Shameem worked on some lyrics for the film but her contributions were later not included.    Release and reception  Neranja Manasu was released on 11 November 2004, during the week of Diwali. S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu opined that \"Though the storyline is run-of-the-mill, the treatment and screenplay are worth a mention\". A critic from Indiaglitz noted \"the movie could have been much better had the director tried to tell a story rather build a story around a character\". Malini Mannath of Chennai Online wrote \"Samudrakani who gave us a classy, slightly different film in his debut 'Unnai Saran Adainthen', prefers to tread the safe path here. It's an old storyline, an old style of presentation, too many loose ends, and unexplained scenes\". Visual Dasan of Kalki wrote Balasubramaniam's story that had potential to be realistic and documentary kind of village film has been changed colours for Vijayakanth and also felt the writer seems to have confused about the timeline however the screenplay without slackness can be forgiven for it and particularly praised Sampath's performance as antagonist.

The Satanic panic is a moral panic consisting of over 12,000 unsubstantiated cases of Satanic ritual abuse (SRA, sometimes known as ritual abuse, ritualistic abuse, organized abuse, or sadistic ritual abuse) starting in the United States in the 1980s, spreading throughout many parts of the world by the late 1990s, and persisting today. The panic originated in 1980 with the publication of Michelle Remembers, a book co-written by Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder and his patient (and future wife), Michelle Smith, which used the controversial and now discredited practice of recovered-memory therapy to make claims about satanic ritual abuse involving Smith. The allegations, which arose afterward throughout much of the United States, involved reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in the context of occult or Satanic rituals. Some allegations involve a conspiracy of a global Satanic cult that includes the wealthy and elite in which children are abducted or bred for human sacrifice, pornography, and prostitution. Nearly every aspect of the ritual abuse is controversial, including its definition, the source of the allegations and proof thereof, testimonies of alleged victims, and court cases involving the allegations and criminal investigations. The panic affected lawyers, therapists, and social workers who handled allegations of child sexual abuse. Allegations initially brought together widely dissimilar groups, including religious fundamentalists, police investigators, child advocates, therapists, and clients in psychotherapy. The term satanic abuse was more common early on; this later became satanic ritual abuse and further secularized into simply ritual abuse. Over time, the accusations became more closely associated with dissociative identity disorder (then called multiple personality disorder) and anti-government conspiracy theories. Initial interest arose via the publicity campaign for Pazder's 1980 book Michelle Remembers, and it was sustained and popularized throughout the decade by coverage of the McMartin preschool trial. Testimonials, symptom lists, rumors, and techniques to investigate or uncover memories of SRA were disseminated through professional, popular, and religious conferences as well as through talk shows, sustaining and further spreading the moral panic throughout the United States and beyond. In some cases, allegations resulted in criminal trials with varying results; after seven years in court, the McMartin trial resulted in no convictions for any of the accused, while other cases resulted in lengthy sentences, some of which were later reversed. Scholarly interest in the topic slowly built, eventually resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon was a moral panic, which, as one researcher put it in 2017, \"involved hundreds of accusations that devil-worshipping paedophiles were operating America's white middle-class suburban daycare centers.\" A 1994 article in the New York Times claims that: \"Of the more than 12,000 documented accusations nationwide, investigating police were not able to substantiate any allegations of organized cult abuse\".    History     Origins  Among the explanations of why the panic occurred when it did, or \"took the shape that it did\", include   Three films that opened and ran near the beginning of the panic having to do with Satanism, namely Rosemary’s Baby (1968), The Exorcist (1973), and The Omen (1976). According to scholar Joseph Laycock, patients hypnotized by therapists to recover memories of SRA, often \"seemed to be recalling scenes from these films\". The reaction against the surge of new religious movements (NRMs) in the 1960s due to both the immigration reform allowing missionaries for Asian religions, as well as new religions, (including the Church of Satan), arising from the counterculture of the baby boomer generation. Sometimes called the \"cult wars\" or \"cult scare\". The Tate–LaBianca murders committed by Charles Manson and his cult of \"mostly lonely teenagers from broken homes\" Mike Warnke's bestselling 1972 memoir The Satan Seller, in which he claimed to have led a group of 1,500 Satanists that engaged in rape and human sacrifice before he converted to evangelical Christianity. The book was praised by Moody Monthly and The Christian Century. Two decades later the book was debunked by an evangelical magazine, Cornerstone.    Early history   Allegations of horrific acts by outside groups, including cannibalism, child murder, torture, and incestuous orgies can place minorities in the role of the \"Other\", as well create a scapegoat for complex problems in times of social disruption.  The SRA panic repeated many of the features of historical moral panics and conspiracy theories, such as the blood libel against Jews by Apion in the 30s CE, the wild rumors that led to the persecutions of early Christians in the Roman Empire, later allegations of Jewish rituals involving the cannibalism of Christian babies and desecration of the Eucharist, and the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries. Dark Harvest is a 2006 horror novel by Norman Partridge. The book is set in a hamlet where its young men must confront a creature each year in the hopes that they will win a desirable prize.\nA film adaptation of the novel was released in 2023.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n\n=== Plot ===\nThe novel is set in an unnamed Midwestern hamlet, where each year, all of the young men take part in a yearly ritual in which they hunt a giant pumpkin-headed creature that arises from the corn, known as both \"Sawtooth Jack\" and the \"October Boy\". They are tasked with catching the creature before it makes it to the hamlet's church, which it must do before midnight, in order to win the ordeal. Girls are forbidden from participating or being outside during the hunt. The winner of the hunt receives the ability to leave the hamlet – something not otherwise possible – and his family is given a new home, car, and a year free from bills. Winners are frequently idolized, and last year's winner, Jim Shepard, is no exception.\nUnbeknownst to the participants, the truth behind the ritual is far darker than what they would expect. While the winner's family does receive their prizes, the winning boy is killed, so he may become the new creature, the following year, when he is resurrected, as a gnarled monster with a pumpkin head.  His father, this year Jim's father Dan, is forced to carve a face for the creature and then later, persuade the creature to let itself be caught, if it does happen to make it to the church by midnight. Many of the town's fathers are aware of the truth of the ritual but still allow their sons to take part. This year, the October Boy is determined that it will be the last year for the ritual.\nUltimately, the October Boy manages to make it to the church, with the help of some of the local teens, where he finds that his father has committed suicide.  He also comes face-to-face with the hamlet's lawman, Jerry Ricks, who is determined that the ritual continue. Ricks's attempts are for naught, as he is shot and killed. The church and surrounding buildings are then set ablaze by the October Boy as the townspeople flee, now able to freely leave the hamlet.\n\n\n== Release ==\nDark Harvest was first released in a limited edition, signed hardback in October 2006. The following year Tor Books issued the novel in e-book and paperback format.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPublishers Weekly named it one of the 100 best books of the year. A reviewer for Dread Central was critical, writing that \"the author forgot to tie up a lot of loose ends, for example why the entire town is in lock-down in the first place and dependent on the massacre of its perennial monster.\" The reviewer for the Austin Chronicle was more favorable, as they felt that \"The only weakness is Partridge's insistence at times to intentionally use a distracting second-person narrative. That is but a small complaint.\"\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nBram Stoker Award for Best Long Fiction (2006, won)\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\n\nNew Regency optioned the film rights, with Matt Tolmach to produce but was sold to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in April 2020 after New Regency dropped the film into turnaround. The film stars newcomers Casey Likes and E’myri Crutchfield in the lead roles, and was released by MGM in 2023, with a screenplay by Michael Gilio.\n\n\n== References == Caspar Babypants is the stage name of children's music artist Chris Ballew, who is also widely known as the singer of The Presidents of the United States of America.

Robinson( date of birth and death unknown) was a male wrestler who competed for England. Sir George Ivan \"Van\" Morrison (born 31 August 1945) is a Northern Irish singer- songwriter, instrumentalist and record producer. His professional career began as a teenager in the late 1950s playing a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands, covering the popular hits of that time. Van Morrison rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&B band Them, with whom he recorded the garage band classic \"Gloria\". His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in 1967. After Berns's death, Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him three sessions to record \"Astral Weeks\" (1968). Though this album gradually garnered high praise, it was initially a poor seller. Van Morrison has a reputation for being at once stubborn, idiosyncratic, and sublime. His live performances at their best are seen as transcendental and inspired; while many of his recordings, such as the studio albums \"Astral Weeks\" and \"Moondance\", and the live album \" It's Too Late to Stop Now\", are acclaimed. \"Moondance\" (1970) established Morrison as a major artist, and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances. He continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received, sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains. Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&B, such as the popular singles \" Brown Eyed GirlJackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)Domino\" and \"Wild Night\". An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as the album \"Astral Weeks\" and the lesser known \"Veedon Fleece\" and \"Common One\". The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic soul\". He has received two Grammy Awards, the 1994 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, the 2017 Americana Music Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting and has been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was knighted for services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland. He is known by the nickname Van the Man to his fans. Sir George Ivan Morrison OBE  (born 31 August 1945) is a singer-songwriter and musician from Northern Ireland whose recording career spans seven decades. Morrison began performing as a teenager in the late 1950s, playing a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands, covering the popular hits of that time. Known as \"Van the Man\" to his fans, Morrison rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Belfast R&B band Them, with whom he wrote and recorded \"Gloria\", which became a garage band staple. His solo career started under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single \"Brown Eyed Girl\" in 1967.  After Berns's death, Warner Bros. Records bought Morrison's contract and allowed him three sessions to record Astral Weeks (1968). While initially a poor seller, the album has come to be regarded as a classic. Moondance (1970) established Morrison as a major artist, and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances. Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and early rhythm and blues. An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz and stream of consciousness narrative, such as the album Astral Weeks. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as \"Celtic soul\", and his music has been described as attaining \"a kind of violent transcendence\". Morrison's albums have performed well in the UK and Ireland, with more than 40 reaching the UK top 40. He has scored top ten albums in the UK in four consecutive decades, following the success of 2021's Latest Record Project, Volume 1. Eighteen of his albums have reached the top 40 in the United States, twelve of them between 1997 and 2017. Since turning 70 in 2015, he has released – on average – more than an album a year. He has received two Grammy Awards, the 1994 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, the 2017 Americana Music Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting and has been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was knighted for services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland.    Life and career     Early life and musical roots: 1945–1964  George Ivan Morrison was born on 31 August 1945, at 125 Hyndford Street, Bloomfield, Belfast, Northern Ireland, as the only child of George Morrison, a shipyard electrician, and Violet Morrison (née Stitt), who had been a singer and tap dancer in her youth. The previous occupant of the house was the writer Lee Child's father. Morrison's family were working class Protestants descended from the Ulster Scots population that settled in Belfast. From 1950 to 1956, Morrison, who began to be known as \"Van\" during this time, attended Elmgrove Primary School. His father had what was at the time one of the largest record collections in Northern Ireland (acquired during his time in Detroit, Michigan, in the early 1950s) and the young Morrison grew up listening to artists such as Jelly Roll Morton, Ray Charles, Lead Belly, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and Solomon Burke; of whom he later said, \"If it weren't for guys like Ray and Solomon, I wouldn't be where I am today. Those guys were the inspiration that got me going. If it wasn't for that kind of music, I couldn't do what I'm doing now.\" His father's record collection exposed him to various musical genres, such as the blues of Muddy Waters; the gospel of Mahalia Jackson; the jazz of Charlie Parker; the folk music of Woody Guthrie; and country music from Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers, while the first record he ever bought was by blues musician Sonny Terry. When Lonnie Donegan had a hit with \"Rock Island Line\", written by Huddie Ledbetter (Lead Belly), Morrison felt he was familiar with and able to connect with skiffle music as he had been hearing Lead Belly before that. Morrison's father bought him his first acoustic guitar when he was 11, and he learned to play rudimentary chords from the song book The Carter Family Style, edited by Alan Lomax. In 1957, at the age of twelve, Morrison formed his first band, a skiffle group, \"The Sputniks\", named after the satellite, Sputnik 1, that had been launched in October of that year by the Soviet Union. The Best of Van Morrison is a compilation album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It compiles songs spanning 25 years of his recording career. Released in 1990 by Polydor Records, the album was a critical and commercial success, becoming one of the best-selling records of the 1990s and helping revive Morrison's mainstream popularity. Its success encouraged him to release a second and third greatest hits volume in 1993 and 2007, respectively. The album remains Morrison's best-seller.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\n\nThe Best of Van Morrison was Morrison's first greatest hits album and featured songs that were compiled from 25 years of material including \"Wonderful Remark\", a song which first appeared on the soundtrack to the 1983 film The King of Comedy. The album became one of the best-selling records of the 1990s, spending a year and a half on the UK charts, helping Morrison regain his commercial popularity during the decade. It also debuted at number one in Australia on the ARIA Albums Chart. In the United States, the album never reached the Top 40 of the Billboard 200 but remained on the chart for more than four-and-a-half years. In 2002, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having shipped four million copies in the US. Morrison was reluctant at first to have a greatest hits album released, although its success encouraged him to personally select tracks for the second and third volumes in 1993 and 2007, respectively. \"As the story goes, Van Morrison wanted nothing to do with his first greatest hits collection\", wrote Andrew Gilstrap from PopMatters. \"He probably warmed up to the idea, though, after the sales figures started pouring in—year after year after year.\"\nThe Best of Van Morrison was acclaimed by critics from Goldmine and Q magazine, who called it essential. In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said although the songs are not sequenced chronologically, the album flows as a unified and \"spiritually enlightened\" work that also reflects the compilers \"upbeat market savvy\". He took note of the seven songs from Morrison's music in the 1980s, particularly \"Wonderful Remark\", writing that they live up to the standards of his 1970s albums Moondance (1970) and Into the Music (1979). In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine viewed the record as an exceptional compilation and a perfect sampler of Morrison's music, which is made to \"seem a little more immediate and accessible than it usually is\" on his studio albums. The Best of Van Morrison remains his best-selling release.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\nNotes\nThe 1998 Australian/New Zealand re-release of the album also includes \"Days Like This\" (3:13) (from the 1995 album of the same name) as the seventh track, for a total of 21 tracks.\nIn 1998, the album was remastered and re-released, this time with the original stereo album version of \"Brown-Eyed Girl\".\nThe original LP omitted \"Wonderful Remark\", \"Full Force Gale\", \"Queen of the Slipstream\" and \"Dweller on the Threshold\".

He is also recognized nationally as an erudite speaker on\" The Teachings of the Buddha.\" \"Moondance\" is a song recorded by Northern Irish singer and songwriter Van Morrison and is the title song on his third studio album Moondance (1970). It was written by Morrison, and produced by Morrison and Lewis Merenstein. Morrison did not release the song as a single until September 1977, seven and a half years after the album was released. It debuted two months later where it reached #92, on the US Billboard Hot 100 and #91 on the US Cash Box Top 100 The single's B-side, \"Cold Wind in August\", had been released in the same year, on his latest album at the time, A Period of Transition. \"Moondance\" is the song that Van Morrison plays most frequently in concert.    Composition and recording  \"Moondance\" was recorded at the Mastertone Studio  in New York City in August 1969, with Lewis Merenstein as producer. The song is played mostly acoustic, anchored by a walking bass line (played on electric bass by John Klingberg), with accompaniment by piano, guitar, saxophones, and flute with the instruments played with a soft jazz swing. It's a song about autumn, the composer's  favourite season. Towards the end of the song, Morrison imitates a saxophone. The song also features a piano solo, played by Jef Labes, which is immediately followed by an alto saxophone solo by Jack Schroer. The song ends with a trill on the flute during the cadenza that fades out. Schroer's solo is often noted as one of the most influential saxophone solos in popular music. The scale used in Schroer's \"Moondance\" solo is A Aeolian (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) or could simply be considered as a C major scale and is played primarily over a D minor to A minor vamp that resolves via a lowered VI (♭6  F7) to natural V (5  E7♯9) dominant chord. Music journalist Erik Hage wrote that the significance of the song \"lies in its direct jazz approach\", expanding that observation with \"Astral Weeks had suggestions of jazz, but this song would take the genre head on. It would become Van Morrison's most successful and definitive jazz composition.\" Music critic Johnny Rogan described \"Moondance\" as a \"celebration of nature,\" \"expressed through a lovers' union in the night air.\" \"Moondance\" was written and developed while Morrison was living in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He has commented, \"With 'Moondance' I wrote the melody first. I played the melody on a soprano sax and I knew I had a song so I wrote lyrics to go with the melody. That's the way I wrote that one.  I don't really have any words to particularly describe the song, sophisticated is probably the word I'm looking for. For me, 'Moondance' is a sophisticated song.  Frank Sinatra wouldn't be out of place singing that.\" The guitar player in his band at that time, John Sheldon, remembers that during the summer of 1968, at a rehearsal, the band was fooling around with a Broadway tune called “Lazy Afternoon” released in 1967 in a jazz version by Grant Green. Morrison requested some changes and began singing a melody that would eventually become \"Moondance.\"    Other releases  \"Moondance\" as originally recorded on the album Moondance is one of the songs on the compilation album, The Best of Van Morrison, released in 1990 and also on the compilation album Still on Top – The Greatest Hits, released in 2007. Several live performances have been released by Morrison on albums over the years. A medley with \"My Funny Valentine\" appears on the 1994 live double album A Night in San Francisco, a live be-bop influenced version of the song is on the 1996 album How Long Has This Been Going On, and is performed with Georgie Fame at the Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. An edit of said version is also included on the 2007 compilation album The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3. Another live version appears on the  2006 limited edition CD Live at Austin City Limits Festival. A previously unreleased live recording of \"Moondance\", recorded at the Greek Theatre in 1986, with a recreation of The Caledonia Soul Orchestra is included on the 2007 compilation album, Van Morrison at the Movies - Soundtrack Hits. \"Moondance\" was one of the songs performed on Morrison's first video Van Morrison in Ireland, released in 1981, and it also was performed as a medley with \"Fever\" for Morrison's second video Van Morrison The Concert, released in 1990. Theodred II was a medieval Bishop of Elmham. The date of Theodred's consecration unknown, but the date of his death was sometime between 995 and 997. Accentuate the Positive is the 45th studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released on 3 November 2023 by Exile Productions and Virgin Records. It is a cover album of Morrison's favourite rock and roll, R&B and country songs. The album received positive reviews from critics.\nAccentuate the Positive marks Morrison's second consecutive album of covers and second album of 2023, following on from his album of skiffle covers from March, Moving On Skiffle.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\nAccentuate the Positive received a score of 72 out of 100 on review aggregator Metacritic based on seven critics' reviews, indicating \"generally favorable\" reception. Uncut stated that \"this rock'n'roll album falls far short of Little Richard's atomic excitement in a genre here showing its age, but 78-year-old Van sounds youthly eager, even sensual in between the hushed female harmonies and honky-tonk piano of 'You Are My Sunshine'\". David Quantick of Classic Rock called it \"something of a relief that Accentuate the Positive is, purely and simply, a covers album\" that is \"performed with the majestic casualness that only Van Morrison can bring to a song\".\nRecord Collector's Terry Staunton described the album as a \"lively mix of swing, jump jive, R&B and classic rock'n'roll [that] constantly plays to the singer's strengths as a thoughtful, inventive interpreter\". Mojo felt that \"the quieter moments work best, like the moody, organ-led reworking of 'Shakin' All Over', which lesser bands have thrashed into the ground over the years but really shines here\".

Four singles were released from the album—\"Evil Empowered\", title track \"Ritual\", \"Dead Behind the Eyes\", and \"Under Rapture\".\nThe album was produced by Josh Wilbur. Max Cavalera published the statement and said \"For this one, we really tried to retain the groove of early Soulfly as well as my love for the heavy, fast stuff I'm into: like death and black metal and some hardcore. Working with Josh Wilbur for Soulfly this time around has been amazing. He's a huge fan and added a lot to the record. I would fight for the fast songs and he would always push me to add more groove. I think in the end we created a really cool mix of songs that covers a lot of ground in my career.\"\nRitual sold 3,600 copies in its first week of release in the US\nand is the first Soulfly album to not debut on the Billboard 200. It is their first album since 2010's Omen to have its installment of their self-titled song series on the standard edition.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRitual received generally favorable reviews by critics, with the aggregate score of 75% on Metacritic. Prior to release, Wall of Sound writer Jim Birkin rated the album 9/10, stating: \"There is undoubtedly some old school Cavalera creeping into his music these days and that can only be a good thing. May all future Soulfly albums contain Josh Wilbur in its production.\" This album was awarded a 2018 Metal Storm Award for Best Thrash Metal Album.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References == \" O Valencia!\" is the fifth single by the indie rock band The Decemberists, and the first released from their fourth studio album,\" The Crane Wife\".

Chingola town was hit with deaths associated with ritual killings with the recent one happening on December 30, 2019, in which six members of the same family were attacked with machetes, and others died from this incident.\nZambia has been left wondering what is really happening to the nation, known to hold strong Christian morals from since the country was declared a Christian nation by the second republican president Fredrick Chiluba. The residents took matters into their own hands and broke into shops owned by businessmen alleged to have been behind the ritual killings in Chingola. The irate residents started the riots as early as 08:30 hours, blocking highway roads with burning tyres and trees to show frustration.\nFor weeks, serial killers penetrated copperbelt killing innocent people.

Police were on alert and quick to respond on each call received from the public, to control ground confusion.

Biography     1936–1950: Early life and career beginnings  Stockwell was born into a family of entertainers in the North Hollywood section of Los Angeles, and grew up between there and New York City. He was the younger son of Elizabeth \"Betty\" (Veronica) Stockwell, a vaudeville actress, and Harry Stockwell, an actor and lyric baritone singer. His father appeared in New York productions of Carousel and Oklahoma!, and was the voice of the Prince in Disney's 1937 animated feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. His elder brother was television and film actor Guy Stockwell. His stepmother, Nina Olivette, was an actress, comedian, singer, and toe dancer in burlesque and theater in New York and throughout North America. His mother's family was Italian. Stockwell's father was appearing on Broadway in Oklahoma! when he heard about a play, Innocent Voyage by Paul Osborne, that was looking for child actors. Stockwell's mother took their two sons down to audition, and both boys were successful. Stockwell's part was small and the play had only a short run, but it led to a contract with MGM. The studio cast him in a small role in The Valley of Decision (1945), a popular melodrama. Producer Joe Pasternak gave him a bigger part in Anchors Aweigh (1945) with Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, where he played the nephew of Kathryn Grayson. The film was popular, and MGM gave him a key role in The Green Years (1946) as Robert Shannon, an Irish Catholic orphan who grows up in a Scottish Presbyterian household. It was a huge hit. He also made a brief appearance in the MGM school room during the chase sequence of Abbott and Costello in Hollywood (1945). 20th Century Fox borrowed him for Home Sweet Homicide (1946) with Peggy Ann Garner where he was billed fourth. He co-starred with Wallace Beery in The Mighty McGurk (1947) at MGM, a remake of The Champ (1931) which Beery had made previously with Jackie Cooper. He also had the lead in the short A Really Important Person (1947). He had supporting roles in The Arnelo Affair (1947), The Romance of Rosy Ridge (1947) (as Janet Leigh's brother), and Song of the Thin Man (1947), billed fourth as the son of William Powell and Myrna Loy's characters. He later said, \"I have very positive feelings regarding both of them, they were very sweet people, especially Myrna Loy. And that cute little dog, Asta. I liked that little dog.\" Nevertheless, Stockwell found being a child actor difficult overall, stating, \"I didn't enjoy acting particularly, when I was young. I thought it was a lot of work. Cold Breath is a 2017 film by Abbas Raziji. Mabel's Latest Prank is a 1914 film both starring and co-directed by Mabel Normand and Mack Sennett. The Believer is a 2001 American drama film written and directed by Henry Bean in his feature directorial debut, based on a story by Bean and Mark Jacobson. Starring Ryan Gosling, Billy Zane, Theresa Russell, and Summer Phoenix, the film follows Daniel Balint, a Jew who becomes a neo-Nazi. The film is loosely based on the true story of Dan Burros, a member of the American Nazi Party and the New York branch of the United Klans of America who died by suicide after being revealed as Jewish by a reporter from The New York Times.  The Believer premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2001, where it won the Grand Jury Prize. It was theatrically released in the United States on May 17, 2002, to positive reviews, with particular praise for Gosling's performance. The film earned several accolades, including the Golden St. George at the 23rd Moscow International Film Festival. It received four nominations at the 17th Independent Spirit Awards, Best First Feature and Best Screenplay for Bean, Best Male Lead for Gosling, and Best Supporting Female for Summer Phoenix.    Plot  The film begins with a continuing series of flashbacks into the childhood of Daniel Balint, a young Jewish yeshiva student. Brilliant but troubled, he often challenged his teachers with unorthodox interpretations of scripture. During a debate about the Binding of Isaac, Daniel argues that the story was not about Abraham's faith but God's power: that God's purpose was not to have Abraham accomplish a particular task, but rather to demand unquestioning obedience; harshly depicting God as a bully. It is from these early experiences that Daniel begins to defect from his Jewish identity.  In the present day, Daniel is now a fanatically violent neo-Nazi in New York in his early twenties. Daniel and his group of skinhead friends find a meeting of fascists run by Curtis Zampf and Lina Moebius, where he also makes a connection with Lina's daughter Carla. Daniel advocates killing Jews, and a banker named Manzetti in particular, but Curtis and Lina oppose harming Jews on practical if not moral grounds. Impressed with Daniel's intelligence and oratory, Lina invites him to their camp retreat in the country. Afterward, Daniel and his neo-Nazi friends pick a fight with two African-American men, get arrested, and are bailed out by Carla. He spends the night with her but returns to his ailing father's home where he is harangued by his sister Linda for his Nazi beliefs, but she also urges him to stay and have Shabbat dinner. The men watch TV, which is forbidden on the Sabbath according to some Orthodox Jews, leading them to commiserate on the incomprehensibility of Jewish law. Guy Danielsen, a journalist writing an article on hate groups, meets Daniel for an interview. He listens to Daniel's antisemitic speech, but then reveals that he knows Daniel is Jewish from tracking down his old rabbi and bar mitzvah record. Enraged by this, Daniel pulls out a pistol and threatens to commit suicide if Guy publishes the truth. Daniel goes to the fascist camp retreat, where he meets Drake, a skilled marksman, along with an explosives expert. Six of the retreat participants, including Daniel, go to a Jewish deli, where they torment the owner about Jewish dietary laws until a fight breaks out. Daniel and his friends are required by a court to take sensitivity training, where they listen to the experiences of Holocaust survivors. One talks about how his infant son was murdered by a Nazi. Daniel is enraged that the man did nothing to save his son, but all the survivors assert that Daniel would also have done nothing, and he walks out in anger. The story haunts him, and he imagines himself as the Nazi. Later that night, Daniel and the gang break into a synagogue, vandalize it, and plant a time bomb under the pulpit. They also tear, trample, and spit on a Torah scroll, though Daniel protests. After they leave, Daniel takes the scroll and a tallit katan with him. The next morning, the neo-Nazis hear on the news that the bomb failed to go off. Back in his cabin, Daniel puts on the tallit under his shirt and performs a combination of the Nazi salute and a Hagbaha. Drake approaches him with a plan to kill Manzetti. Outside a temple, Daniel fires at him but misses. Drake discovers the tallit and realizes that he is a Jew, so Daniel shoots him and escapes. He continues to meet with Lina and Curtis, who want to start an above-ground movement to bring fascism into the political mainstream, inviting Jews, blacks, and liberals. Daniel reluctantly agrees to help them raise funds. At the meetings that follow, Daniel first charms, then enrages, their potential donors with his intellectual games, leading to his expulsion.

Starring Thomas Jane, Neal McDonough, and Molly Parker, the film was released on Netflix on October 20, 2017.    Plot  In 1922, Wilfred \"Wilf\" James is a farmer living in Hemingford, Nebraska with his wife, Arlette James, and their 14-year-old son, Henry. Wilf is opposed to Arlette's plans to sell the farm and move to Omaha. He convinces Henry to help murder his mother, holding Henry's girlfriend, Shannon Cotterie, whose relationship Arlette opposes, at stake. Henry reluctantly agrees. Wilf gets Arlette drunk and Henry covers her face while Wilf cuts her throat with a butcher's knife. He dumps her body into a dry well, where her corpse is fed upon by rats. The next day, they drop a cow into the well to hide Arlette's body and provide a reason for filling in the well. Sheriff Jones is suspicious following her sudden disappearance but finds no proof of a crime. As time passes, Henry becomes brooding and isolated, regretting the crime that he and his father committed. Shannon discovers she is pregnant with Henry's child. Her parents decide to send her to a Catholic institution in Omaha. Henry steals Wilf's car and runs away with Shannon. As the winter passes, Wilf appears to be going insane, constantly harassed by rats. He takes out a mortgage on his house to fix it up, but is never actually able to begin the work, as a rat bites his hand. Owing to neglect, the roofs on his barn and his house cave in, but he is too consumed by guilt and alcohol to fix them, and in his isolation, his hand injury worsens. His house falls in to a state of disrepair and becomes completely infested by rats. In a climactic scene, Wilf is confronted by the ghost of his wife, surrounded by the rats that ate her corpse. She recounts the fate of Henry and Shannon. They became robbers, known as the \"Sweetheart Bandits\". During one of their heists, Shannon is shot, causing her to miscarry the baby and ultimately die. Henry lies down next to her and dies by suicide, shooting himself. In the hospital after his hand is amputated owing to the infection, Wilf is told by the sheriff that an unidentified woman's body has been found on the side of the road, which the sheriff assumes is Arlette. Henry's body is delivered to Wilf, which, like his mother's body, has been chewed through by rats. No one attends Henry's funeral except for Wilf. He attempts to sell his land to Shannon's father, who bluntly tells Wilf to never come back. After selling the land to the livestock company at a low price, Wilf moves to Omaha and finds a job but cannot escape being followed by rats. Eight years later, in 1930, Wilf writes his confession, concluding, \"In the end, we all get caught.\" By the time he finishes, dozens of rats have swarmed his room. Arlette, Henry, and Shannon's corpses have appeared in front of Wilf. Brandishing the same butcher's knife used to kill his mother, Henry tells Wilf that his death will be quick.

After These Final Hours was completed, Hilditch decided to adapt 1922 into a motion picture, as he had found the story to have been \"cinematic\" on its own. Writing a speculative screenplay before finding out if he would be able to obtain the rights to the project, Hilditch was given six months to finish writing his script. After meeting producer Ross M. Dinerstein in Los Angeles, who sent his screenplay to Netflix, Hilditch was quickly told that his idea would become a film under the platform. Principal photography for 1922 began in Vancouver with cinematographer Ben Richardson to take advantage of the tax credit given to films shot in Canada. The Academy Award for Best International Feature Film (formerly known as Best Foreign Language Film prior to 2020) is handed out annually by the U.S.-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States of America with a predominantly non-English dialogue track. When the first Academy Awards ceremony was held on May 16, 1929, to honor films released in 1927–28, there was no separate category for foreign language films. Between 1947 and 1955, the Academy presented Special/Honorary Awards to the best foreign language films released in the United States. These awards, however, were not handed out on a regular basis (no award was given in 1953), and were not competitive since there were no nominees but simply one winning film per year. For the 1956 Academy Awards, a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since then. Unlike other Academy Awards, the Best International Feature Film Award is not presented to a specific individual. It is accepted by the winning film's director, but is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. As of 2014, the Academy changed its rules so that the name of the director is etched onto the Oscar statuette, in addition to the film's country. The director also gets to keep the statuette. Over the years, the Best International Feature Film and its predecessors have been given almost exclusively to European films: out of the 74 awards handed out by the Academy since 1947 to foreign language films, fifty-seven have gone to European films,[A] nine to Asian films,[B] five to films from the Americas and three to African films. The late Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini directed four winning motion pictures during his lifetime, more than any other director. If Special Awards are taken into account, then Fellini's record is tied by his countryman Vittorio De Sica. The Soviet epic War and Peace (1966–67), for its part, is the longest motion picture to have won the Best Foreign Language Film Award. Filmed from 1962 to 1966, it ran for more than seven hours.    Winners and nominees  In the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release; the ceremonies are always held the following year. Films in bold and dark blue background have received an Academy Award; winning films from 1947 to 1955 won a Special/Honorary Award as denoted in the key, while all other winning films won a regular Academy Award of Merit. Films that are neither highlighted nor in bold are the nominees. When sorted chronologically, the table always lists the winning film first and then the four other nominees. The Submitting country column indicates the country that officially submitted the film to the Academy, and is not necessarily indicative of the film's main country of production. The original titles of the films are also mentioned, as well as the names of the directors and the languages used in the dialogue track, even though none of these elements is officially included in the nomination. When several languages are used in a film, the predominant one is always listed first; the names of the other languages are written in smaller typesize and placed between brackets. When a film's original title is in a language that uses a non-Latin script, it is first transliterated into the Latin alphabet and then written in its original script. Films from the former Yugoslavia are written in both Latin and Cyrillic due to the fact that the previously official Serbo-Croatian language used both alphabets. Chinese film titles are romanized according to the pinyin system, and are written using the characters employed in their submitting country, i.e. traditional Chinese ones for films submitted by Hong Kong and Taiwan, and simplified Chinese ones for films submitted by the People's Republic of China.    1940s     1950s     1960s     1970s     1980s     1990s     2000s     2010s     2020s     Multiple wins and nominations     Multiple wins  Six directors have won the award more than once.    Multiple nominations     Shortlisted finalists (not nominated)  Since the 79th Academy Awards (2006), a nine-film shortlist has been announced before the nominations, which then has been reduced to the five official nominees. Six Days of the Condor is a thriller novel by American author James Grady, first published in 1974 by W.W. Norton. The story is a suspense drama set in contemporary Washington, D.C., and is considerably different from the 1975 film version,\" Three Days of the Condor\".

It is the first part of the \"Condor Trilogy\" and is followed by \"The Return of the Condor Heroes\" and \"The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\". It was first serialised between 1 January 1957 and 19 May 1959 in \"Hong Kong Commercial Daily\". Jin Yong revised the novel twice, first in the 1970s and later in the 2000s. The English title is imprecise since neither species of the condor, the Andean condor and Californian condor, is native to China. In February 2018, a translation of the first volume (out of four) was published with the title \"A Hero Born\". Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (German: Nosferatu – Eine Symphonie des Grauens) is a 1922 silent German Expressionist vampire film directed by F. W. Murnau and starring Max Schreck as Count Orlok, a vampire who preys on the wife (Greta Schröder) of his estate agent (Gustav von Wangenheim) and brings the plague to their town. Nosferatu was produced by Prana Film and is an unauthorized and unofficial adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. Various names and other details were changed from the novel, including Count Dracula being renamed Count Orlok then finally Nosferatu, an archaic Romanian word with a suggested etymology of Nesuferitu`, meaning \"the offensive one\" or \"the insufferable one\". Although those changes are often represented as a defense against copyright infringement, the original German intertitles acknowledged Dracula as the source. Film historian David Kalat states in his commentary track that since the film was \"a low-budget film made by Germans for German audiences... setting it in Germany with German-named characters makes the story more tangible and immediate for German-speaking viewers\". Even with several details altered, Stoker's heirs sued over the adaptation, and a court ruling ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed. However, several prints of Nosferatu survived, and the film came to be regarded as an influential masterpiece of cinema and the horror genre. Critic and historian Kim Newman declared it as a film that set the template for the genre of horror film.    Plot   In 1838, in the fictional German town of Wisborg, Thomas Hutter is sent to Transylvania by his employer, estate agent Herr Knock, to visit a new client, Count Orlok, who plans to buy a house across from Hutter's own home. While embarking on his journey, Hutter stops at an inn in which the locals are frightened by the mere mention of Orlok's name. Hutter rides on a coach to a castle, where he is welcomed by Count Orlok. When Hutter is eating dinner and accidentally cuts his thumb, Orlok tries to suck the blood out, but his repulsed guest pulls his hand away. Hutter wakes up the morning after to find fresh punctures on his neck, which he attributes to mosquitoes. That night, Orlok signs the documents to purchase the house and notices on the table a miniature portrait of Hutter's wife, Ellen, an image that the young man carries with him in a small circular frame. Admiring the portrait, the count remarks that she has a \"lovely neck.\" Later, Hutter continues to read a book about vampires that he took from the local inn. He now begins to suspect that Orlok is indeed a vampire. With no way to bar the door of his bedroom, Hutter desperately tries to hide as midnight approaches. Suddenly, the door begins to slowly open by itself; and, as Orlok enters, a terrified Hutter hides under the bed covers and falls unconscious. Meanwhile, at the same time back in Wisborg, Ellen arises from her own bed and sleepwalks to the railing of her bedroom's balcony. She then starts walking on top of the railing, which gets the attention of her friend Harding, who is in the adjacent room. When the doctor arrives, Ellen shouts Hutter's name and envisions Orlok in his castle threatening her unconscious husband. The next day, Hutter explores the castle, only to retreat back into his room after he finds the coffin in which Orlok is resting dormant in the crypt. Hours later, Orlok piles up coffins on a coach and climbs into the last one before the coach departs, and Hutter rushes home after learning that. The coffins are taken aboard a schooner, where the sailors discover rats in the coffins. All of the ship's crew later die, and Orlok takes control. When the ship arrives in Wisborg, Orlok leaves unobserved, carries one of his coffins and moves into the house that he purchased. Many deaths in the town follow after Orlok's arrival, which the town's doctors blame on an unspecified plague caused by the rats from the ship. Ellen reads the book that Hutter found; it claims that a vampire can be defeated if a pure-hearted woman distracts the vampire with her beauty and offers him her blood of her own free will. She decides to sacrifice herself. She opens her window to invite Orlok in and pretends to fall ill so that she can send Hutter to fetch Professor Bulwer, a physician. After he leaves, Orlok enters and drinks her blood, but the sun rises, which causes Orlok to vanish in a puff of smoke. 1922 is a year.\n1922 may also refer to:\n\n\n== Arts, entertainment, and media ==\n1922 (1978 film), a Greek drama film directed by Nikos Koundouros\n1922 (novella), a 2010 novella by Stephen King\n1922 (2017 film), an American horror film based on King's novella\n\n\n== Weapons ==\nFN Model 1922, a pistol\nFyodorov–Shpagin Model 1922, a machine gun\nSpringfield Model 1922, a bolt-action rifle\n\n\n== Other uses ==\n1922 Committee, the parliamentary group of the Conservative Party in the UK House of Commons\nSubmarine 1922, a submarine volcano The Boeing Condor is a high- tech test bed aerial reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle. It has a wingspan of over 200 feet. Carbon- fibre composite materials make up the bulk of the Condor's fuselage and wings. Although the Condor has a relatively low radar cross-section and infrared signature, it is not unobservable making it too vulnerable for use in military operations. The Condor is completely robotic, with an onboard computer to communicate with the computers on the ground via satellite to control all facets of the Condor's missions. The Condor's frame is made of mainly Carbon- fiber- reinforced polymer composite, as it gives off very low radar and heat signatures. In 1989, the Condor set the world piston- powered aircraft altitude record of and was the first aircraft to fly a fully automated flight from takeoff to landing and also setting an unofficial endurance world record in 1988 by flying continuously for more than 50 hours; the flight was not ratified by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale( FAI) and is therefore not considered an official record. During its evaluations, the Condor logged over 300 flight hours, flying over Moses Lake, Washington.

It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It won the Golden Prize at the 13th Moscow International Film Festival. The film was a co-production between Nicaragua, Mexico and Cuba. The film is loosely based on the novel\" Alsino\" by Chilean writer Pedro Prado. It was the comeback film of actor Dean Stockwell. Notable Cuban director of photography Jorge Herrera died during the production due to a brain hemorrhage. == Plot ==\nAlsino, a 10 or 12-year-old boy, lives with his grandmother in a remote area of Nicaragua. Trying to be like any other child, he climbs trees with a friend, dreaming of flying, jumping several times from the top of a huge tree believing that \"Amsterdam\" is the magical word that will make him fly.\nThe Central American country is engulfed in the final stages of a civil conflict, a war between rebels of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and government troops that is about to explode. An American military advisor, arriving in the community to establish a preparation camp, seeking to carry out prevention actions to avoid direct attacks in the \"red zones,\" meets Alsino, who had been brought to him by guards after trying to escape from a battalion patrolling the area. He invites Alsino to climb into his helicopter, \"El Cóndor,\" and takes him on a flight, although impressed, Alsino says, \"I want to fly but without help.\"\nIn one of his attempts to fly, Alsino jumps from the tall tree and falls abruptly to the ground; the impact dislocates his shoulder and neck, leaving him with a hunchback. While he heals, he hears \"noises\" inside him that foreshadow destruction in his home. At the request of his grandmother, he goes down to the nearby town to sell a saddle inherited from his disappeared grandfather, probably a member of the Dutch navy in 1942. There he has his first drink of rum and is taken to a brothel where he only talks with the girl, all this in wartime.\nAlsino witnesses the cruelties that the military forces inflict on those suspected of being insurgents, and in one of these raids, he meets several characters who awaken in him a longing for freedom, generating sympathy towards the Sandinista rebels. When they find him hiding in the mountains, the leader of the group offers to accompany and protect him on the journey.\nAfter learning of his grandmother's death, and following the failure of \"Operation Cóndor,\" whose helicopter is bayoneted and shot down, Alsino decides to join the guerrilla ranks where he becomes fully involved in the conflict.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nDean Stockwell as Frank\nAlan Esquivel as  Alsino\nCarmen Bunster as Alsino's Grandmother\nAlejandro Parodi as The Major\nDelia Casanova as Rosaria\nMarta Lorena Pérez as Lucia\nReynaldo Miravalles as Don Nazario, the Birdman\nMarcelo Gaete as Lucia's Grandfather\nJan Kees De Roy as Dutch Adviser\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n=== Wins ===\nMoscow International Film Festival - Golden Prize, Miguel Littin, 1983.\n\n\n=== Nominations ===\nAcademy Awards - Best Foreign Language Film, 1983.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of submissions to the 55th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of Nicaraguan submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film 2017 in film is an overview of events, including the highest-grossing films, award ceremonies, festivals, a list of films released, and notable deaths.    Evaluation of the year  Richard Brody of The New Yorker observed that for 2017, \"the most important event in the world of movies was the revelation, in The New York Times and The New Yorker, of sexual abuse by Harvey Weinstein, and the resulting liberation of the long-stifled voices of the people who had been abused by him or other powerful figures in the movie business, and, for that matter, in other arts and industries, too.\" He emphasizes that in effect, \"[w]hat's missing from the year-end list, and from the era in movies, isn't only the unmade work by these filmmakers but the artistry and the careers of cast and crew members who would have been in their unrealized films.\"    Highest-grossing films   The top films released in 2017 by worldwide gross are as follows:  Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, The Fate of the Furious, and Despicable Me 3 have each grossed over $1 billion, making them among the highest-grossing films of all time, with the latter being the fourth-highest-grossing animated film. Wolf Warrior 2, a Chinese film, became the first non-Hollywood film to be listed on the all-time worldwide top 100 box office. Split, by M. Night Shyamalan, was the year's most profitable film in terms of return on investment (ROI), having generated over 2,000% ROI. It is the 11th film to cross 2,000% ROI, and the first film to do so since 2015.    2017 box office records  In China, the country recorded a new single-day record as well as an all-time admission high on Saturday, January 28, with over ¥755 million (US$110 million) registering an admission of over 21 million moviegoers, beating the previous record of ¥647 million ($98.4 million) and 17 million admissions set the previous year. Both records were set on the first day of the Chinese New Year. In May, China had its first consecutive monthly gain in box office revenue in more than a year, led by Indian film Dangal, followed by Hollywood film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. 2017 has been a record year for non-Hollywood foreign films in the Chinese market, with the success of films such as India's Dangal, Thailand's Bad Genius and Spain's Contratiempo. As of November 5, 2017, non-Hollywood imports account for 72% ($519.7 million) of the year's foreign film box office revenue so far ($723 million), with Dangal alone accounting for 27% ($195.8 million). The Marvel Cinematic Universe became the first film franchise to gross more than $11 billion with the release of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. With the subsequent release of Spider-Man: Homecoming, it became the first film franchise to gross more than $12 billion, and with the release of Thor: Ragnarok, the MCU became the first film franchise to gross more than $13 billion. It also became the first film franchise to release three movies in one year that all made over $800 million worldwide and opened to over $100 million domestically (through the aforementioned entries). The Despicable Me franchise became the highest-grossing animated franchise ever ($3.6 billion), surpassing the Shrek franchise; it also became the first animated franchise to have two films hit over $1 billion. With Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, and Wonder Woman, 2017 was the first year since 1958 (South Pacific, Auntie Mame, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) in which the top 3 highest grossing domestic films were female-led. Wolf Warrior 2 was a massive commercial success and became the highest-grossing Chinese film ever released. The film broke numerous box office records, including the biggest single-day gross for a Chinese film as well as the fastest film to cross the RMB 2 billion, 3 billion, 4 billion and 5 billion box office marks. It also became the fastest film to surpass US$500 million and the first film to gross more than US$600 million at the Chinese box office. At a total domestic gross of CN¥5.68 billion (US$874 million), it is the second-highest-grossing film of all time in a single market behind only Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($936.7 million in North America), and having exceeded North America's totals from Avatar ($760 million), Titanic ($659 million) and Jurassic World ($652 million).\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Are the bands Cinematic Sunrise and Kingston Falls, from the same country?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nCraig Owens (born August 26, 1984) is an American musician best known as the former lead vocalist of Chiodos. He has also had an involvement in various projects such as Cinematic Sunrise, The Sound of Animals Fighting, Isles & Glaciers, and Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows. He has recorded as a solo artist, is an established music producer, has written and recorded with the likes of Dr. Dre, and has also acted in the 2012 film K-11. He currently performs under the stage name badXchannels.    Music career     Chiodos    In 2001, Owens joined Bradley Bell, Pat McManaman, Jason Hale, Matt Goddard and Derrick Frost to form a band in Davison, Michigan. Originally named \"Chiodos Bros.\" in tribute to special effects trio the Chiodo Brothers, the band recorded its first demo in June 2002. Following several years of national touring and independent recording, they were signed by Equal Vision Records in 2004 and, under the name Chiodos, released their first full-length album, All's Well That Ends Well in 2005. They continued thereafter, recording and touring. Even after his separation from his first band, Owens continued to have an interest in working with them and, after being asked by his management about what project he most wanted to pursue, he made overtures about a possible return to Chiodos. On April 26, 2012, Owens announced his return to Chiodos. Subsequently, on April 27, the remaining members of D.R.U.G.S. revealed their intention to disband. Chiodos' first live appearance after their reunion took place on August 9, 2012, in a sold-out performance at Flint Local 432 in Michigan. As of that date, the members had tentative plans for a new album, on which they have been working separately but not yet begun to coordinate. On November 1, 2016, in an interview with Billboard, vocalist Craig Owens stated in regards to Chiodos that, \"It's done, it just couldn't stay afloat. There were just kind of, not necessarily bad vibes, but we came to the realization that we can't do it full-time. I think it just stopped becoming a passion for most of us so we said, 'Alright, let's stop.\" Thus bringing an end to Chiodos' fifteen-year career. Owens is now performing under the stage moniker badXchannels and is touring in support of his new solo album \"WHYDFML\" (what have you done for me lately).    The Sound of Animals Fighting   Owens featured as vocalist in the supergroup, the Sound of Animals Fighting. Owens featured on the album Lover, the Lord Has Left Us.. released in 2006.

Owens appeared in the groups live line up We Must Become the Change We Want to See in 2006 along with 11 other members.    Cinematic Sunrise   During this work with Chiodos, Owens and Bell formed the side project Cinematic Sunrise as a place to perform music that didn't fit Chiodos' style. When the band signed with Equal Vision, in March 2008, its line-up had included Owens, Bell, Bryan Beeler, Marcus Vankirk and Dave Shapiro. Cinematic Sunrise released an EP later that Spring, A Coloring Storybook and Long Playing Record.    Isles & Glaciers   In September 2008, Owens revealed to fans on his journal that in addition to several guest vocalist appearances, he was working on another side project with Jonny Craig of Emarosa/Dance Gavin Dance, Vic Fuentes of Pierce the Veil and Nick Martin of Cinematic Sunrise. When the Isles & Glaciers supergroup was officially announced in December, it also included Owens' bandmate Matt Goddard, Fuentes' brother and bandmate Mike Fuentes and Brian Southall from the band TREOS. The supergroup premiered their first songs during a radio interview on January 18, 2009. Battle of the Bands is a contest in which two or more bands compete for the title of\" best band\".

Cinematic Sunrise was a pop punk American band signed to Equal Vision Records. It consisted of Craig Owens( vocals) and Bradley Bell( piano), along with Bryan Beeler( guitar), Marcus VanKirk( bass), Nick Martin( guitar), and Dave Shapiro( drums). == History ==\nOwens and Beeler have been members of Cinematic Sunrise since its formation in the Spring of 2005 when the band was founded with Ben Wixson, Tony Campbell, and Brandon Kubiak of Detroit-area band, Only in Movies. Beeler also played in the group Class of '83. \nThis lineup was short-lived, and the band regrouped with drummer Dave Shapiro of Count the Stars, Marcus Van Kirk of Radio Pirate DJ, Bradley Bell, and Nick Martin of both Underminded and Isles & Glaciers. Owens and Bell were both in Chiodos at the time Cinematic Sunrise was formed. As Cinematic Sunrise, they were in the middle of a deal with Chiodos's label, Equal Vision, in 2008.  The group's debut EP, the misleadingly titled A Coloring Storybook and Long Playing Record, was released on May 13, 2008. Beeler recorded, produced, and engineered the EP. The EP dented the Billboard charts at No. 196 and hit No. 8 on the Top Heatseekers chart, as well as No. 26 on the Top Independent Albums chart. The EP was re-released in late October 2008, with two new songs, due to selling out of the original pressing of 10,000.\nThe group announced six final shows in December 2009. Pete Wentz of Fall out Boy joined the band for a few songs each night. Wentz came onstage as the band jokingly kicked Marcus Van Kirk off stage so Wentz could play, Marcus is still a member of the band and Owens' best friend. Bradley Bell was absent from this tour, presumably because he and Owens were not on good terms regarding their Chiodos split, and all keyboard parts were looped live. Drummer Dave Shapiro was also unable to play the band's final dates due to his conflicting schedule with The Agency Group.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nA Coloring Storybook and Long Playing Record (Equal Vision Records, 2008) Clinton Bradley David Bell (born March 18, 1983, in Davison, Michigan), known professionally as Bradley Bell, is an American keyboardist, pianist, synthesist, and backing vocalist, best known for being the keyboardist of post-hardcore band Chiodos, and also for being the keyboardist of pop punk band Cinematic Sunrise until their demise, and the keyboardist of experimental band The Sound of Animals Fighting. He was also in a pop punk band called Still No Sign, where he was the lead vocalist. Chiodos guitarist Pat McManaman was also in this band.\n\n\n== Musical career ==\n\n\n=== Still No Sign and Cinematic Sunrise (2000–2009) ===\nBell was the lead vocalist, along with members Pat McManaman, and two other members named Matt and Chad, of a pop punk band called Still No Sign. The band released one EP, literally entitled The EP, but disbanded in 2001 so Bell and McManaman could move on to Chiodos.\nBell was the keyboardist of pop punk band Cinematic Sunrise, along with Craig Owens, Underminded frontman Nick Martin, and the Agency Group manager Dave Shapiro. He was featured on their first and only EP, A Coloring Storybook and Long Playing Record. During the band's last six shows, Bell was absent from all of them, presumably because of bad terms between him and Owens.\n\n\n=== Chiodos (2001–present) ===\nBell is the only keyboardist to ever be in post-hardcore band Chiodos, previously known as the Chiodos Bros. Bell has been featured on every release by the band so far, except for their debut EP, The Chiodos Bros. In an interview with Double Dance, Bell was asked about the origin of the title and the concept behind Chiodos' most recent release, Illuminaudio. In response, Bell stated that\n\n\"[t]here is no concept to the album but there are themes that seem reoccurring. A lot of the content has to do with stepping outside of your comforts and adapting to change, avoiding manipulation, and coming out of dark situations with a positive outlook. Illuminaudio is a play on words that, to me, means to shine or enlighten through music. We [Chiodos] came up with it one night and it stuck with us.\"\nBell was also asked about the chemistry of the band after the departure of vocalist Craig Owens and the arrival of Brandon Bolmer. He answered that\n\n\"[Chiodos'] chemistry now is great. Everybody gets along. It was funny in the studio when people on multiple occasions would come visit and say, 'This is the first time I have seen the whole band in one room together hanging out.' No bad feelings toward him, but it would have been a task to finish this record, and that's the main reason why we did what we did [firing Craig Owens]. Regardless, the writing and recording is an extremely stressful time when pressure definitely sets in, so it's hard for anyone to remain pleasant all the time.\nHe also said that he would like to keep touring and do overseas touring as well.\nIn another interview question about Owens with Review Rinse Repeat, Bell was asked about what exactly made Chiodos remove Owens. Bell answered with\n\n\"There are many reasons as to the relieving of Craig, most of which are personal and can not be released. We don't think it would be fair to provide information that would force anyone to attach themselves to one bias or another. Just know that this record would have been near impossible to create with the lineup the way that it was. The band was at an unhealthy state, that should be undeniable by both parties.\"\nLater in the interview, he was asked about the decision to attempt to keep Brandon Bolmer's position as lead vocalist a secret. He answered that Chiodos was\n\n\"scheming a plan to make a big announcement out of Brandon being the singer, which would allow critics and those interested to actually hear some music with him on it, instead of them feeling free to criticize off of presumptions based on his past and what people were expecting from us. Nevertheless, the information leaked right before we were about to do so. Even after months of not telling anyone, it seems you can't keep anything a secret these days.\"\n\n\n== Discography ==\nwith Still No Sign\nThe EP (Self-released, 2001)\nwith Chiodos\nThe Best Way to Ruin Your Life (Self-released, 2002)\nThe Heartless Control Everything (Self-released, 2003)\nAll's Well That Ends Well (Equal Vision Records, 2005)\nBone Palace Ballet (Equal Vision Records, 2007)\nIlluminaudio (Equal Vision Records, 2010)\nDevil (Razor & Tie, 2014) \nwith Cinematic Sunrise\nA Coloring Storybook and Long Playing Record (Equal Vision Records, 2008)\n\n\n== References == Kofi Nahaje Sarkodie-Mensah (born August 14, 1981) is a Ghanaian-born American professional wrestler. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Kofi Kingston and is part of The New Day. After graduating from Boston College, he decided to pursue a professional wrestling career, and began performing on the New England independent circuit as a Jamaican wrestler by the name of Kofi Nahaje Kingston. After signing a developmental deal with WWE in 2006, he shortened his ring name to Kofi Kingston. He debuted in WWE in 2008 using the same Jamaican character as he did on the independent circuit. In late 2009, he stopped being billed from Jamaica and dropped the accent, although he kept his ring name. He then started being billed from his home country of Ghana. From 2008 to 2013, Kingston became a four-time Intercontinental Champion, a three-time United States Champion, and a one-time World Tag Team Champion with CM Punk. In 2014, he formed The New Day with Big E and Xavier Woods. The trio went on to break the record for the longest tag team championship reign in WWE history when they held the WWE (Raw) Tag Team Championship from August 2015 to December 2016, defending the titles under the Freebird rule. All totaled, Kingston is a 15-time tag team champion in WWE. In April 2019, Kingston defeated Daniel Bryan at WrestleMania 35 to win the WWE Championship, giving him 23 total championships in WWE. He is the first, and currently only, African-born world champion in WWE history. His WWE Championship win also made him WWE's 30th Triple Crown Champion and 20th overall Grand Slam Champion (13th under the current format). With his NXT Tag Team Championship win in 2022, Kingston also became a Tag Team Triple Crown Champion, becoming the only wrestler to have won both the traditional and tag team version of the WWE Triple Crown, as well as having the most overall reigns with a WWE-branded tag team championship with 15. With the exception of a few months spent as a villain in 2015 with The New Day, Kingston has been a heroic character for almost the entirety of his WWE career. Kingston has also gotten some distinction through his numerous methods of avoiding elimination during the Royal Rumble.

He has a brother, Kwame (who is a Twitch streamer under the name Temp0), and a late sister, Nana Akua. He moved with his family to the United States and eventually settled in the greater Boston area, where he graduated from Winchester High School in Winchester, Massachusetts, and then Boston College, majoring in communications.    Professional wrestling career     Training and early career (2005–2006)  Sarkodie-Mensah started training in late 2005 and made his official wrestling debut in 2006 for Chaotic Wrestling, when he faced Evan Siks on June 4 for the PWF Mayhem Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort. He competed primarily in the New England area, including stints in National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) – New England (where he was briefly a member of Barry Ace's \"A-List\"), Millennium Wrestling Federation (MWF), New England Championship Wrestling (NECW), the Eastern Wrestling Alliance (EWA), and Chaotic Wrestling.    World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE     Developmental territories (2006–2007)  In September 2006, he signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was assigned to Deep South Wrestling (DSW), a Georgia-based developmental federation. He debuted in the new company, as Kofi Nahaje Kingston, in a dark match loss to Montel Vontavious Porter on September 21. For the rest of 2006 and the beginning of 2007, he appeared in DSW, as well as its Kentucky-based sister promotion Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he was in a tag team dubbed the Commonwealth Connection with Harry Smith. In 2007, under the ring name Kofi Nahaje Kingston, he had his first exposure to the main WWE roster, when he worked dark matches on March 5 and 26 before episodes of Raw against Charlie Haas and Trevor Murdoch, respectively. When he returned to the developmental federations, he shortened his original ring name to Kofi Kingston and continued to alternate between both ring names throughout his duration there. He also worked live events, defeating Shelton Benjamin on May 5, and Val Venis on May 6. Kingston is the capital and largest city of Jamaica, located on the southeastern coast of the island. It faces a natural harbour protected by the Palisadoes, a long sand spit which connects the town of Port Royal and the Norman Manley International Airport to the rest of the island. Kingston is the largest English-speaking city south of the United States in the Western Hemisphere. The local government bodies of the parishes of Kingston and Saint Andrew were amalgamated by the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation Act of 1923, to form the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC). Greater Kingston, or the \"Corporate Area\" refers to those areas under the KSAC; however, it does not solely refer to Kingston Parish, which only consists of the old downtown and Port Royal. Kingston Parish had a population of 89,057, and St. Andrew Parish had a population of 573,369 in 2011 Kingston is only bordered by Saint Andrew to the east, west and north. The geographical border for the parish of Kingston encompasses the following communities: Tivoli Gardens, Denham Town, Rae Town, Kingston Gardens, National Heroes Park, Bournemouth Gardens, Norman Gardens, Rennock Lodge, Springfield and Port Royal, along with portions of Rollington Town, Franklyn Town, and Allman Town. The city proper is bounded by Six Miles to the west, Stony Hill to the north, Papine to the northeast, and Harbour View to the east, which are communities in urban and suburban Saint Andrew. Communities in rural St. Andrew such as Gordon Town, Mavis Bank, Lawrence Tavern, Mt. Airy, and Bull Bay would not be described as being in Kingston city. Two districts make up the central area of Kingston: the historic Downtown and New Kingston. Both are served by Norman Manley International Airport and also by the smaller and primarily domestic Tinson Pen Aerodrome.    History   Kingston was founded on 22 July 1692, shortly after the 1692 earthquake that devastated Port Royal in 1692; the original section of the city which was situated at the bottom of the Liguanea Plains was laid out to house survivors of that earthquake. Before the earthquake, Kingston's functions were purely agricultural. The earthquake survivors set up a camp on the sea front. Approximately two thousand people died due to mosquito-borne diseases. Initially the people lived in a tented camp on Colonel Barry's Hog Crawle. The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703. Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West, and Harbour Streets. The new grid system of the town was designed to facilitate commerce, particularly the system of main thoroughfares 66 feet (20 m) across, which allowed transportation between the port and plantations farther inland. By 1716, it had become the largest town and the centre of trade for Jamaica. The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in Port Royal, and only land on the sea front. Gradually, wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of Liguanea. The first free school, Wolmers's, was founded in 1729 and there was a theatre, first on Harbour Street and then moved in 1774 to North Parade. Both are still in existence. In 1755 the governor, Sir Charles Knowles, had decided to transfer the government offices from Spanish Town to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston. The Church of St. Thomas, on King Street, the chief thoroughfare, was first built before 1699 but was rebuilt after the earthquake in 1907. By the end of the 18th century, the city contained more than 3,000 brick buildings. The harbour fostered trade. It was involved in several naval wars of the 18th century. Kingston took over the functions of Spanish Town (the capital at the time). These functions included agriculture, commercial, processing and a main transport hub to and from Kingston and other sections of the island. In 1788, Kingston had a population of 25,000, which was about a tenth of the overall population of the island. One in every four people living in Kingston was white, but there was a large population of free people of color there too; two out of every five people living in Kingston were free.

The set is composed of several facades that form an archetypal American town square with a courthouse as its centerpiece. The set was built for the 1948 film An Act of Murder  and was featured as downtown Hill Valley in the Back to the Future trilogy, as well as Kingston Falls in the Gremlins series.\nPrior to the Back to the Future series, the area was known as Mockingbird Square owing to its role in the film To Kill a Mockingbird. It has been severely damaged by fire several times, including in 1957, 1990 and 2008. It was reconstructed after each incident.\n\n\n== Fires ==\n\nA three-alarm fire broke out at the Universal back lot in the early morning hours on June 1, 2008. It was reported that Courthouse Square was destroyed, though the Courthouse facade and town facade to the north are still standing. The King Kong attraction and New York Street were destroyed.

It draws on legends of folkloric mischievous creatures that cause malfunctions—\"gremlins\"—in the British Royal Air Force going back to World War II. The story follows young man Billy Peltzer, who receives a strange creature as a pet, which then spawns other creatures that transform into aggressive imp-like monsters that wreak havoc on Billy's town during Christmas Eve. The film was the center of large merchandising campaigns and opts for black comedy, balanced against a Christmastime setting. Steven Spielberg was the film's executive producer, with the film being produced by Michael Finnell. Gremlins was theatrically released on June 8, 1984 by Warner Bros. to critical and commercial success. However, it was heavily criticized for some of its more violent sequences.  In response to this and to similar complaints about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg suggested that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) alter its rating system, which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new PG-13 rating. It was followed by a sequel, Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990).    Plot  Struggling inventor Randall Peltzer visits a Chinatown antique store, hoping to find a Christmas present for his son Billy. In it, Randall finds a small and furry creature called a mogwai (Cantonese: 魔怪, 'devil'). The owner, Mr. Wing, refuses to sell it to Randall, but his grandson secretly does, warning Randall to remember three important rules concerning the mogwai – do not expose the creature to light, especially sunlight, which will kill it; do not let it come in contact with water; and above all, never feed it after midnight. In Randall’s hometown of Kingston Falls, Billy works at the local bank, but fears that his dog Barney will be put down by widowed miser Mrs. Deagle. His father returns and gives him the mogwai, now named “Gizmo\", as a pet, as well as explaining the three rules. Gizmo is friendly and docile, but when Billy's friend, Pete Fountaine, accidentally spills water on Gizmo, five more mogwai spawn from him, a more mischievous sort led by the aggressive Stripe, named after the white mohawk-like tuft of fur on his head. Billy shows one of the mogwai to his former elementary school science teacher, Mr. Hanson, spawning another mogwai, whom Hanson experiments on. Back at home, Stripe and his fellow mogwai trick Billy into feeding them after midnight by severing the power cord on his alarm clock. They form cocoons, as does Hanson's mogwai, which soon hatch, emerging as destructive monsters called \"gremlins\", who attack Billy's mother Lynn, while Hanson is murdered by his gremlin. Lynn and Billy are able to kill the gremlins, except for Stripe, who escapes to a local YMCA where he jumps into its swimming pool, spawning an army of gremlins that wreak havoc in Kingston Falls. Many people are injured or outright killed by the gremlins' rampage, including Mrs. Deagle. Billy rescues his girlfriend, Kate Beringer, and they hide in the bank where Kate reveals to Billy and Gizmo that when she was nine years old, her father went missing on Christmas Eve and did not come home on Christmas Day either; several days later, he was found dead in their chimney while dressed as Santa Claus. Planning to surprise her and her mother, he had accidentally slipped and broken his neck, killing him instantly, while climbing down the chimney. Still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, Kate confesses this is how she lost her Christmas spirit. Billy and Kate discover that the gremlins are watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in the local theater. They set off a natural gas explosion, killing all the gremlins except for Stripe, who flees to eat candy at a Montgomery Ward store across the street. As morning approaches, they follow Stripe into the department store, where he attempts to use a fountain to spawn more gremlins. Gizmo opens a nearby skylight, exposing Stripe to sunlight and killing him. As the local news reports on the day's mysterious tragedies, Mr. Wing reclaims Gizmo at the Peltzer home. He scolds the family for their negligence and criticizes Western society for its carelessness with nature. However, as he turns to leave, Gizmo, having bonded with Billy, bids him goodbye.

In 1998 he formed a band called Early Times with his younger brother Mike. After releasing three EPs the band was forced to rename due to copyright violation. The group changed their name to \"Before Today\". After signing a recording contract with Equal Vision Records the band released their only album, A Celebration of an Ending, in 2004 before breaking up two years later. In 2007 the duo released their debut record, A Flair for the Dramatic, with the newformed band called Pierce the Veil.

In November 2022, Fuentes was featured on Cavetown's album worm food on track 4, titled \"a kind thing to do\".    Songwriting  Fuentes has written songs with the likes of Tom Denney, Curtis Peoples and Dave Yaden. He doesn't have a concept for writing his songs but gains inspiration from familiar situations, personal experiences in relationships, touring and friends.  He has written songs inspired by fans, such as \"Bulls in the Bronx\", on the album Collide with the Sky. This was written for young Australian, Olivia Penpraze, who committed suicide in April 2012. Her friends wrote a letter to the band about what had happened. Penpraze had been a fan of Pierce the Veil.  \"I Don't Care If You Are Contagious\", from the second album, Selfish Machines, was also a fan-inspired song. The musicians said in an interview with music magazine Alternative Press that a young girl had contacted the band, writing that her boyfriend had died in a car accident, and that they had met for the first time during a Pierce the Veil concert. Fuentes wrote this song as a present for her. \"Million Dollar Houses (The Painter)\" from the same record is dedicated to his parents. The song is about their parents, who never separated even in a time when the family had almost nothing. Many fans thanked the band for the songs they wrote. They certify their lyrics would have a \"healing effect\". Kingston Falls were an American Christian hardcore band, and they primarily played hardcore punk and metalcore.

        "answer": "no",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Are both Lesser Slave Lake and Medeweger See located in the same country?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nLesser Slave Lake is a provincial electoral district for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, Canada.  It has existed since 1971 and is mandated to return a single member using the first past the post method of voting. The riding is named after the lake of the same name, which is located entirely within its borders.    Geography  Lesser Slave Lake is a predominantly rural riding located in Northern Alberta. There are no cities in the riding. It includes only two incorporated urban municipalities: the towns of High Prairie and Slave Lake. The riding also includes the entirety of one rural municipality (the Municipal District of Opportunity No. 17) and parts of three others (Big Lakes County, the Municipal District of Lesser Slave River No. 124, and Northern Sunrise County). Eleven First Nation bands are based in Lesser Slave Lake: Bigstone Cree Nation, Driftpile First Nation, Kapawe'no First Nation, Loon River Cree Nation, Lubicon Lake Indian Nation, Peerless Trout First Nation, Sawridge First Nation, Sucker Creek Cree First Nation, Swan River First Nation, Whitefish Lake First Nation, and Woodland Cree First Nation. Most of the region's Indigenous population is of Cree origin. The riding borders five other electoral districts: Peace River to the northwest, Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo to the northeast, Fort McMurray-Lac La Biche to the east, Athabasca-Barrhead-Westlock to the south, and Central Peace-Notley to the west.    History  The electoral district was created in the 1971 boundary re-distribution from the electoral districts of Grouard and Peace River. The district remained largely unchanged until the 1993 boundary re-distribution when the electoral district was extended north to the Northwest Territories, Alberta border. The 2003 boundary re-distribution saw the district revert to similar boundaries that existed prior to 1993. The 2010 boundary re-distribution saw the district re-aligned with current municipal boundaries with a portion of land on the south end moved into Barrhead-Morinville-Westlock. In the 2017 electoral boundary re-distribution only minor changes were made to the districts boundaries, which were enlarged to include the Calling Lake Reserve. Lesser Slave Lake is one of two electoral districts in the province that are afforded the exemption provided in the Electoral Boundaries Commission Act whereby only four electoral districts in Alberta may have a population which is as much as 50% below the average population of all the proposed electoral districts. The rationale for this exemption is the relatively low population in the region and large distances between population centers. The total population of the district in the 2017 re-distribution was 27,818 which is 41% below the provincial average for electoral districts.    Boundary history     Representation history   The electoral district was created in 1971. Prior to the districts creation the area had elected Social Credit MLA's. The first election saw a tight race between Social Credit candidate Dennis Barton and Progressive Conservative candidate Garth Roberts. Barton eked out a win with just 41% of the popular vote. Barton would be defeated in the 1975 election by Progressive Conservative candidate Larry Shaben who rolled up a landslide majority. Shaben would serve four terms in office and hold three different cabinet portfolios under the governments of Peter Lougheed and Don Getty before retiring from office in 1989. The third representative of the riding was Progressive Conservative candidate Pearl Calahasen who was elected to her first term in 1989 in a tight three-way race winning less than half the popular vote. She would also serve some ministerial portfolios from 1996 to 2006 in the government of Ralph Klein. She represented the district for seven terms, becoming the longest-serving female MLA in Alberta history, as well as the longest-serving Indigenous MLA. In the 2015 election, Calahasen placed third of three candidates and was defeated by the NDP's Danielle Larivee, who served in several ministerial portfolios during the 29th Assembly.

The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Lesser Slave Lake is located in central Alberta, Canada, northwest of Edmonton. It is the second largest lake entirely within Alberta boundaries( and the largest easily accessible by vehicle), covering and measuring over long and at its widest point. Lesser Slave Lake averages in depth and is at its deepest. It drains eastwards into the Athabasca River by way of the Lesser Slave River. The town of Slave Lake is located at the eastern tip of the lake, around the outflow of Lesser Slave River. == Conservation and development ==\n\nDue to its location on a major fly-way for migrating birds, Lesser Slave Lake is popular with birders. The nearby Lesser Slave Lake Provincial Park has lakeside camping facilities located along sand beaches, with some rocky beaches as well. Fishing is popular and legal. The entire north shore of the lake is protected, other reserves being Hilliard's Bay Provincial Park, Lesser Slave Lake Wildland and Grouard Trail Park Reserve.\nHighway 2 and the Canadian National Railway follow the southern shore of the lake, and the Bicentennial Highway has its southernmost point at eastern end of the lake.\nA number of Indian reserves are established at the shores of the lake:\n\nKapawe'no First Nations Lands 150, 230 and 231 of the Kapawe'no First Nation,\nSucker Creek 150a of the Sucker Creek Cree First Nation\nDrift Pile River 150 of the Driftpile First Nation\nSwan River 150e of the Swan River First Nation\nSawridge 150g and h Sawridge Band\n\n\n== Accidents ==\nFebruary 14, 1968\nOn February 14, 1968, a Cessna 182H CF-WUK plane crashed into the lake due to ice forming on the wings and causing the pilot to lose control.

Daisy Lake is a lake in the Arctic Ocean and Great Slave Lake drainage basins in South Slave Region, Northwest Territories, Canada. The lake is about long and wide, lies at an elevation of, and is located about southeast of the settlement of Fort Reliance on McLeod Bay, the large easternmost bay of Great Slave Lake. It is also just southeast of the McDonald Fault. The primary inflow is an unnamed creek at the northeast, and the primary outflow is an unnamed creek at the southeast that empties into Dion Lake, whose waters in turn flow via Robert Lake and the Snowdrift River to Great Slave Lake at the community of Lutselk'e. McArthur Lake, formerly Clowey Lake, is a lake in the Northwest Territories, Canada. It is on the Taltson River to the east of Great Slave Lake, and is just south of the tree line. In the past it may have been a center for canoe building. Slave Lake is a small town in northern Alberta, Canada about 255 km( 124.3 mi) northwest of Edmonton and a similar distance southwest of Fort McMurray. It is located on the southeast shore of Lesser Slave Lake, at the junction of Highway 2 and Highway 88, in the Municipal District of Lesser Slave River No. 124. Slave Lake serves as a local centre for the area. The administrative office for the Sawridge First Nation reserve is also located in the town. Slave Lake Airport,, is located adjacent to Slave Lake, Alberta, Canada. Marten Beach is a hamlet in northern Alberta, Canada within the Municipal District of Lesser Slave River No. 124. It is located on the northeast shore of Lesser Slave Lake, west of Highway 88. It is approximately north of the Town of Slave Lake and northwest of the City of Edmonton.

Schwerin (German: [ʃveˈʁiːn] ; Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch Low German: Swerin; Polabian: Zwierzyn; Latin: Suerina, Suerinum) is the capital and second-largest city of the northeastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern as well as of the region of Mecklenburg, after Rostock. It has around 96,000 inhabitants, and is thus the least populous of all German state capitals. Schwerin is located on the southwestern shore of Lake Schwerin (Schweriner See), the second-largest lake of the Mecklenburg Lake Plateau after the Müritz, and there are eleven other lakes within Schwerin's city limits. The city is surrounded by the district of Northwestern Mecklenburg to the north, and the district of Ludwigslust-Parchim to the south. Schwerin and the two surrounding districts form the eastern outskirts of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. The name of the city is of Slavic origin, deriving from the root \"zvěŕ\" (wild animal) or \"zvěŕin\" (game reserve, animal garden, stud farm). Schwerin was first mentioned in 1018 as Zuarina and was granted city rights in 1160 by Henry the Lion, thus it is the oldest city of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As main residence of the House of Mecklenburg, a dynasty with Slavic roots also known as the Obotrites or Niklotides, Schwerin was the capital of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1379 to 1815, of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (after the duke was elevated to the title of a grand duke) from 1815 to 1918, of the Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1918 to 1934, of the State of Mecklenburg (after it was merged with the Free State of Mecklenburg-Strelitz) from 1934 to 1952, and of the District of Schwerin from 1952 to 1990. The romantic Schwerin Palace, situated on Castle Island between Lake Schwerin and Castle Lake, known for its golden dome, the Castle Church, the throne room, and the Niklot statue, used to be the seat of the dukes and grand dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and since 1990, it is the seat of the state parliament of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Schwerin's silhouette is completed by the towers of Schwerin Cathedral, St Paul's Church and St Nicholas' Church. Because of only minor damage in World War II, the city has a largely intact building structure, both in the Altstadt (Old Town) and Schelfstadt (Reed City) quarters. Major industries and employers include high technology, machine building, healthcare, government agencies, railway supply, consumer goods and tourism. Schwerin has two academic colleges, the Schwerin campus of the \"Fachhochschule des Mittelstands\" (University of Applied Sciences of the Mittelstand), and the Schwerin campus of the \"Hochschule der Bundesagentur für Arbeit\" (University of the Federal Employment Agency). There is a regional airport in Parchim, southeast of the city, while Hamburg Airport serves as the city's main airport.    History     Early years  Schwerin is enclosed by lakes. The largest of these lakes, the Schweriner See, has an area of 60 km2. In the middle part of these lakes there was a settlement of the Slavic Obotrite (dated back to the 11th century). The area was called Zuarin (Polabian Zwierzyn), and the name Schwerin is derived from that designation. In 1160, Henry the Lion defeated the Obotrites and captured Schwerin. The town was later expanded into a powerful regional centre. A castle was built on this site, and expanded to become a ducal palace. It is supposedly haunted by the small, impious ghost, called Petermännchen (\"Peterman\"). In 1358, Schwerin became a part of the Duchy of Mecklenburg, making it the seat of the duchy from then on. About 1500, the construction of the Schwerin Palace began, as a residence for the dukes. After the division of Mecklenburg (1621), Schwerin became the capital of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

Following his brief visit, other British agents established several fur trading posts around Slave Lake, including a Hudson's Bay Company post at the mouth of the lake.\nA settlement developed around the post and became known as Sawridge. It was renamed as Slave Lake in 1923. After a flood in the 1930s destroyed much of the town, it was relocated and rebuilt at its current location on higher ground. It was incorporated as a town in 1965.\nThe Town of Slave Lake was inundated by a flood of Sawridge Creek in July 1988.\n\n\n=== 2011 wildfire ===\n\nOn May 15, 2011, large parts of the town were affected by wildfires in the area.

Highway 2 had been closed at the outset of the fire, but eventually re-opened for evacuation. Full evacuation of all residents was ordered for Slave Lake.\nOn May 16, 2011, provincial officials said that 40% of the town had been destroyed or damaged by the fires, including the town hall, the library, a radio station, a mall, and a significant number of homes and other buildings. No injuries or deaths were reported. On May 17, 2011, Mayor Karina Pillay-Kinnee indicated one-third of the town had been destroyed by the wildfire. On May 20, 2011, a firefighting helicopter crashed into the Lesser Slave Lake near Canyon Creek; its pilot died at the scene. It crashed about 30 m (98 ft) off shore into water that was 1.5 m (4.9 ft) deep.\nOn July 6, Prince William and Catherine, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, visited the town to offer encouragement to residents and support for rebuilding efforts.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSlave Lake experiences a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc) that borders on a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb).

Its municipal office is located in the Town of Slave Lake. Located in Census Division 17, the municipal district takes its name from Lesser Slave River, which drains Lesser Slave Lake into the Athabasca River. This is a list of lakes of Alberta, Canada.\nMost of Alberta's lakes were formed during the last glaciation, about 12,000 years ago. \nThere are many different types of lakes in Alberta, from glacial lakes in the Canadian Rockies to small shallow lakes in the prairies, brown water lakes in the northern boreal forest and muskeg, kettle holes and large lakes with sandy beaches and clear water in the central plains.\nDistribution of the lakes throughout the province of Alberta is irregular, with many water bodies in the wet boreal plains in the north, and very few in the semi-arid Palliser's Triangle in the southeast.\n\n\n== River basins ==\nMost of Alberta's waters are drained in a general north or northeastern direction, with six major rivers forming four major watersheds collecting the water and removing it from the province:\n\nThe Peace River and Athabasca River flow north and east, meeting in the massive Peace–Athabasca Delta, eventually feeding the Mackenzie River in south-central Northwest Territories and draining into the Arctic Ocean\nThe North and South Saskatchewan Rivers flow east and form the Saskatchewan River in central Saskatchewan, flowing into Lake Winnipeg, which drains into Hudson Bay on the Arctic/North Atlantic oceans\nThere is an endorheic area between the North and South Saskatchewan basins, the Sounding Creek system, where most of the water drains to Manitou Lake (not to be confused with the more famous Little Manitou Lake) and evaporates.\nThe smaller Beaver River in east-central Alberta flows east into the Churchill River  in north-central Saskatchewan and then drains into Hudson Bay\nThe smaller Milk River in southeast Alberta flows south into the Missouri River in northeastern Montana, which joins the Mississippi River and drains into the Gulf of Mexico\nAs with other basins on the planet, the topographical highlights in the drainage divides between these basins can be difficult to discern. For example, there is little elevation change in the short 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) of land between Lac la Biche and Beaver Lake, yet the former is in a watershed that drains north into the Arctic Ocean, while the latter is in a watershed that drains east into Hudson Bay.\n\n\n== Largest lakes ==\nLake Athabasca is the largest lake in both Alberta and Saskatchewan. This 7,850 km2 (3,030 sq mi) lake has 2,295 km2 (886 sq mi) of its surface area in Alberta and 5,555 km2 (2,145 sq mi) in Saskatchewan.\nThe largest lake completely within Alberta is Lake Claire, at 1,436 km2 (554 sq mi).  Lake Claire is just west of Lake Athabasca, with both located in the remote Peace-Athabasca Delta.\nThis section provides a list of lakes of Alberta with an area larger than 100 km2 (39 sq mi).\n\n\n== List of lakes ==\nThis section provides a list of numerous lakes of Alberta, including the \"large\" ones shown in the previous section.\nNote that the lakes are listed alphabetically by their main name, dropping any leading \"lake\", \"lac\", \"lac la\", \"upper/lower\", \"north/south\".

Mathur was the Director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau between September 1975 and February 1980. He was also the Director General of Police in Punjab. Harold Young (November 13, 1897 – March 3, 1972) was an American film director, editor, and occasional actor.\n\n\n== Career ==\nYoung was born in 1897 in Portland, Oregon, where he was raised and attended high school. \nAfter graduating from Columbia University, Young began his career as a film editor from 1923-1934, working first on a series of George O'Hara short subjects under the director Malcolm St. Clair.\nYoung's best-known early directorial assignment is probably The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), starring Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon, one example of his occasional work in Britain. \nHe died on March 3, 1972, in Beverly Hills, California.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nAs editor:\n\nAs director:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHarold Young at IMDb Rochelle Hudson (born Rachael Elizabeth Hudson; March 6, 1916 – January 17, 1972) was an American film actress from the 1930s through the 1960s. Hudson was a WAMPAS Baby Star in 1931.    Early years  Hudson was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the daughter of Ollie Lee Hudson and Lenora Mae Hudson. While in Oklahoma, she studied dancing, drama, piano, and voice. Hudson began her acting career as a teenager, and completed her high school education at a high school on the Fox studios lot.    Career   Hudson signed a contract with RKO Pictures on November 22, 1930, when she was 14 years old. She may be best remembered today for costarring in Wild Boys of the Road (1933), playing Cosette in Les Misérables (1935), playing Mary Blair, the older sister of Shirley Temple's character in Curly Top, and for playing Natalie Wood's mother in Rebel Without a Cause (1955). During her peak years in the 1930s, notable roles for Hudson included Richard Cromwell’s love interest in the Will Rogers showcase Life Begins at 40 (1935), the daughter of carnival barker W.C. Fields in Poppy (1936), and Claudette Colbert’s adult daughter in Imitation of Life (1934). In 1939 Rochelle Hudson was working on a movie titled Convicted Woman for Columbia Pictures that was released in 1940. Another player in the movie was an actress named June Lang. During production the two struck up conversation in a friendly manner because both had worked on Shirley Temple movies, inspiring a sort of special \"esprit de corps\" between them. Like Hudson's career would soon be, Lang's film career would be interrupted as well, albeit for totally different reasons. Hudson took way too much time away from her acting career with her husband for reasons explained in the next paragraph. Lang got mixed up with and married a suspected heavyweight mob figure said to be a film producer named Johnny Roselli which, as a mob figure, was viewed way to unfavorable by the studios as well. Neither Hudson's nor Lang's careers really got back on track after the war. For more about the collaboration on their movie Convicted Women. Because of the marked slowdown to an almost complete halt in Hudson's film career in the years just prior to the war and into its early years after having gone gangbusters for the whole decade before, people have long thought she had fallen into disfavor with the Hollywood powers that be or that her popularity had just waned to such a point she was simply just being passed over. However, on what some consider to be rather flimsy evidence, it has been reported, and what will be substantiated further down --- with only flimsy evidence found elsewhere notwithstanding --- that she had in fact been working as a spy during that period for the Naval Intelligence Service. She and her husband, posing as a civilian, were doing espionage work primarily in Mexico and together they posed as a vacationing couple to detect if there was any German or Japanese activity there. She played Sally Glynn, the fallen ingenue to whom Mae West imparts the immortal wisdom \"When women go wrong, men go right after them!\" in the 1933 Paramount film, She Done Him Wrong. In the 1954–1955 television season, Hudson co-starred with Gil Stratton and Eddie Mayehoff in the sitcom That's My Boy, based on a 1951 Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin film of the same name.    Personal life   Hudson was married four times. All the unions were childless. Her first marriage was to Harold Thompson, in 1939. He was the head of the Storyline Department at Disney Studios. After their divorce in 1947, (but the trade publication Billboard reported that they divorced on September 4, 1945) she married a second time the following year, to Los Angeles Times sportswriter Dick Irving Hyland. The marriage lasted two years before the couple divorced. Hudson married her third husband, Charles K. Brust, in Jackson, Missouri on September 28, 1956.  Little is known of the marriage other than they were divorced by June 1962 (he remarried). Hudson's final marriage was to Robert Mindell, a hotel executive. The two remained together for eight years before they divorced in 1971. Hudson actually was born in 1916, but the studio reportedly made her two years older for her to play a wider variety of roles, including romantic roles. In That's My Boy, she was cast as the mother of Gil Stratton, who was only six years her junior.    Death  In 1972, Hudson was found dead in her home at the Palm Desert Country Club. A business associate with whom she had been working in real estate discovered her body sprawled on the bathroom floor. There's One Born Every Minute, also known as Man or Mouse, is a 1942 American comedy film directed by Harold Young. It was Elizabeth Taylor's first film and one of her only films with Universal Pictures.\nThe film is a comedy about false advertising. The Twine family profits from marketing their puddings as containing the fantastic Vitamin Z, with the press failing to realize that this vitamin does not exist. A local scientist is persuaded to act as a shill for their product.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nWith a helpful push from his wife Minerva, Lemuel P. Twine, \"Lem\", decides to enter the scene of politics, by running a campaign as reform-mayor of his hometown Witumpka Falls. Normally he runs the Twine's Tasty Pudding Powder Company.\nLem is unaware that his financial backer, Lester Cadwalader Sr., wants him to run in order to secure that the current mayor, Moe Carson, is re-elected. When Lem's oldest daughter Helen Barbara is on her way to her date with Cadwalader's son Lester Jr., aka \"Les\", she accidentally bumps into her ex-boyfriend Jimmy Hanagan, who is just back from marketing studies at college.\nSince Jimmy hasn't found work within his field of advertising yet, he is currently working as a clerk at the Cadwalader's general store. When Les sees Helen and Jimmy together he is jealous and end up firing Jimmy from the store. Instead Jimmy gets a job as advertising director for Helen's father's company. At work, Jimmy comes up with the idea of telling the consumers that the puddings are full of Vitamin Z, a made-up healthy ingredient. He goes on to persuade a local scientist, Asa Quiesenberry, to work with him on the marketing of the product, claiming the discovery of the new fantastic vitamin. The product is tested in a faux laboratory and the media is informed of the vitamin's superior qualities. Among other effects, it is said to enhance the female sexual appetite.\nThe pudding business sky-rockets and the small town is famous nationwide for the new \"Zumf\" vitamin products. Lem is awarded Witumpka Falls Man of the Year\" by the town Chamber of Commerce, and in a newspaper interview with Minerva, she announces the engagement of Helen and Jimmy. These news all upset Les Jr. And Sr. greatly, and they start scheming a plan to ruin the Twine family and their business. \nThe Cadwaladers claim that the Vitamin Z disappears from the pudding powder after it has aged a while. After some intensive testing of old cases of powder, the Cadwaladers announce, at a dinner in Lem's honor, that they have found no trace of Zumf in the old pudding powder. They also claim Jimmy is a fraud and accuses him of bribing scientists to play along.\nHumiliated, Jimmy leaves the Twine family. Lem continues his campaign for mayor and tells the people to elect him as a man, not as the leader of a pudding company. Jimmy returns after a while, and when he does he sees Helen reunited with Les, and becomes very jealous.\nThat night, Lem meets the ghost of his grandfather Claudius, emerging from a painted portrait on the wall. Claudius warns Lem of the Cadwaladers, and the morning after he meets Jimmy and Quisenberry to tell them about his dream.\nWhen Lem tries to tell Moe Carson about Cadwalader's treacherous behavior, Les Sr arrives and a fistfight between him and Moe ensues. The Cadwaladers are exposed as traitors to the town, through flyers handed out by Jimmy and Helen, and Lem is elected mayor.\nLem urges Jimmy to reconcile with Helen, and he does, after giving her a lesson for getting back together with Les when he was gone. After they make up, Claudius watches them happily from his painting on the wall.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nHugh Herbert as Lemuel P.

His film acting roles include Egon Spengler in Ghostbusters (1984) and Ghostbusters II (1989), and as Russell Ziskey in Stripes (1981); he also co-wrote those films. As a director, his films include the comedies Caddyshack (1980), National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), Groundhog Day (1993), Analyze This (1999) and Analyze That (2002). Ramis was the original head writer of the television series SCTV, on which he also performed, as well as a co-writer of Groundhog Day and National Lampoon's Animal House (1978). The final film that he wrote, produced, directed, and acted in was Year One (2009). Ramis's films influenced subsequent generations of comedians, comedy writers and actors. Filmmakers and actors including Jay Roach, Jake Kasdan, Adam Sandler, Judd Apatow, and Peter and Bobby Farrelly have listed his films among their favorites. Along with Danny Rubin, he won the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay for Groundhog Day.    Early life  Ramis was born on November 21, 1944, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Ruth (née Cokee) (1919–2001) and Nathan Ramis (1915–2009), who owned the Ace Food & Liquor Mart on the city's West Side. Ramis had a Jewish upbringing. In his adult life, he did not practice any religion. He graduated from Stephen K. Hayt Elementary School in June 1958 and Nicholas Senn High School in 1962, both Chicago public schools, and in 1966 from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was a member of the Alpha Xi chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. Afterward, Ramis worked in a mental institution in St. Louis for seven months. He later said of his time working there that it:  …prepared me well for when I went out to Hollywood to work with actors. People laugh when I say that, but it was actually very good training. And not just with actors; it was good training for just living in the world. It's knowing how to deal with people who might be reacting in a way that's connected to anxiety or grief or fear or rage. As a director, you're dealing with that constantly with actors. But if I were a businessman, I'd probably be applying those same principles to that line of work.    Career     Early years  Ramis began writing parodic plays in college, saying years later, \"In my heart, I felt I was a combination of Groucho and Harpo Marx, of Groucho using his wit as a weapon against the upper classes, and of Harpo's antic charm and the fact that he was oddly sexy—he grabs women, pulls their skirts off, and gets away with it.\" He avoided the Vietnam War military draft by taking methamphetamine to fail his draft physical. Following his work in St. Louis, Ramis returned to Chicago, where by 1968, he was a substitute teacher at schools serving the inner-city Robert Taylor Homes public housing development. He also became associated with the guerrilla television collective TVTV, headed by his college friend Michael Shamberg, and wrote freelance for the Chicago Daily News. \"Michael Shamberg, right out of college, had started freelancing for newspapers and got on as a stringer for a local paper, and I thought, 'Well, if Michael can do that, I can do that.' I wrote a spec piece and submitted it to the Chicago Daily News, the Arts & Leisure section, and they started giving me assignments [for] entertainment features.\" Additionally, Ramis had begun studying and performing with Chicago's Second City improvisational comedy troupe. Ramis's newspaper writing led to him becoming joke editor at Playboy magazine. \"I called…just cold and said I had written several pieces freelance and did they have any openings. And they happened to have their entry-level job, party jokes editor, open. He liked my stuff and he gave me a stack of jokes that readers had sent in and asked me to rewrite them. I had been in Second City in the workshops already and Michael Shamberg and I had written comedy shows in college.\" Ramis was eventually promoted to associate editor.    National Lampoon, SCTV, and The Top  After leaving Second City for a time and returning in 1972, having been replaced in the main cast by John Belushi, Ramis worked his way back as Belushi's deadpan foil.

Hugh Milburn Stone (July 5, 1904 – June 12, 1980) was an American actor, best known for his role as \"Doc\" (Dr. Galen Adams) on the Western series Gunsmoke.    Early life  Stone was born in Burrton, Kansas, to Herbert Stone and the former Laura Belfield. There, he graduated from Burrton High School, where he was active in the drama club, played basketball, and sang in a barbershop quartet. Stone's brother, Joe Stone, says their uncle Fred Stone, was a versatile actor who appeared on Broadway and in circuses). Although Stone had a congressional appointment to the United States Naval Academy, he turned it down, choosing instead to become an actor with a stock theater company headed by Helen Ross.    Career   In 1919, Stone debuted on stage in a Kansas tent show. He ventured into vaudeville in the late 1920s, and in 1930, he was half of the Stone and Strain song-and-dance act. His Broadway credits include Around the Corner (1936) and Jayhawker (1934). In the 1930s, Stone came to Los Angeles, California, to launch his own screen career. He was featured in the Tailspin Tommy adventure serial for Monogram Pictures. In 1939 he played Stephen Douglass in the movie Young Mr. Lincoln with Henry Fonda and Ward Bond. In 1939 he appeared in When Tomorrow Comes as head busboy (uncredited). In 1940, he appeared with Marjorie Reynolds, Tristram Coffin, and I. Stanford Jolley in the comedy espionage film Chasing Trouble. That same year, he co-starred with Roy Rogers in the film Colorado in the role of Rogers' brother-gone-wrong. Stone appeared uncredited in the 1939 film Blackwell's Island. Stone played Dr. Blake in the 1943 film Gung Ho! and a liberal-minded warden in Monogram Pictures' Prison Mutiny also in 1943. Signed by Universal Pictures in 1943, in the films Captive Wild Woman (1943), Jungle Woman (1943), Sherlock Holmes Faces Death [Captain Pat Vickery], (1944), he became a familiar face in its features and serials, starring as  hero Jim Hudson in The Great Alaskan Mystery (1944). In 1944, he portrayed a Ration Board representative in the Universal-produced public service film Prices Unlimited for the U.S. Office of Price Administration and the Office of War Information. One of his film roles was a radio columnist in the Gloria Jean-Kirby Grant musical I'll Remember April. He made such an impression in this film that Universal Studios gave him a starring role (and a similar characterization) in the 1945 serial The Master Key.  The same year, he was featured in the Inner Sanctum murder mystery The Frozen Ghost.  In 1953, Stone appeared as Charlton Heston's sidekick in Arrowhead, a Western also featuring Brian Keith and Katy Jurado.  In 1955, one of CBS Radio's hit series, the Western Gunsmoke, was adapted for television and recast with different actors for various reasons (William Conrad was judged too obese to play Matt Dillon on camera, Georgia Ellis wasn't viewed as quite telegenic enough to portray Kitty on television, etc.). Howard McNear, the radio Doc Adams (who later played Floyd the barber on television's The Andy Griffith Show), was replaced by Stone, who gave the role a harder edge consistent with his screen portrayals. He stayed with Gunsmoke through its entire television run, with the exception of 7 episodes in 1971, when Stone required heart surgery and Pat Hingle replaced him as Dr. Chapman. Stone appeared in 604 episodes through 1975, often shown sparring in a friendly manner with co-stars Dennis Weaver and Ken Curtis, who played, respectively, Chester Goode and Festus Haggen.    Personal life  Stone's brother, Joe, was a writer who was the author of scripts for three episodes of Gunsmoke. Stone was a cousin of the character actress Madge Blake.  In March 1971, Stone had heart bypass surgery at UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. In June 1980, Stone died of a heart attack in La Jolla. He was buried at the El Camino Memorial Park in Sorrento Valley, San Diego.  Stone had a surviving daughter, Shirley Stone Gleason (born circa 1926) of Costa Mesa, California, from his first marriage of 12 years to Ellen Morrison, formerly of Delphos, Kansas, who died in 1937.  His second wife, the former Jane Garrison, a native of Hutchinson, Kansas, died in 2002. Jason Moore( born October 22, 1970) is an American director of film, theatre and television.

He was the son of actor Alan Hale Sr. His television career spanned four decades, but he was best known for his secondary lead role as Captain Jonas Grumby, better known as The Skipper, on the 1960s CBS comedy series Gilligan's Island (1964–1967), a role he reprised in three Gilligan's Island television films and two spin-off cartoon series. Hale appeared in more than 200 films and television roles from 1941. He appeared primarily in Westerns, portraying the Sundance Kid in The Three Outlaws (1956) opposite Neville Brand as Butch Cassidy, performing with Kirk Douglas in The Big Trees (1952), Audie Murphy in Destry (1954), Ray Milland in A Man Alone (1955), Robert Wagner in The True Story of Jesse James (1957), and Hugh Marlowe in The Long Rope (1961). He also appeared in musical comedies opposite Don DeFore in It Happened on Fifth Avenue (1947), James Cagney in The West Point Story (1950), and Judy Canova in Honeychile (1951). He also appeared on several talk and variety shows.    Early life  Alan Hale MacKahan was born in Los Angeles California. His father was character actor Rufus Edward MacKahan, who used the stage name of Alan Hale, and his mother was silent film actress Gretchen Hartman. His father appeared in more than 235 films and had a successful screen career, both as a leading man in silent films and as a supporting actor in sound movies. Hale Jr. was in the silent movies as a baby. Hale served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II. He dropped the \"Junior\" from his name after his father died in 1950.    Career   In 1931, Hale made his Broadway stage debut in Caught Wet. The play opened on November 4 and closed later that month. He made his screen debut in Wild Boys of the Road which was released in 1933. Although his role was deleted from that film's final release, he still received screen credit for his performance. He later appeared in roles in To the Shores of Tripoli (1942), Yanks Ahoy (1943), Sweetheart of Sigma Chi (1946), and When Willie Comes Marching Home (1950). During the late 1940s and early 1950s, he frequently appeared in Gene Autry films and also had a recurring role from 1950 to 1952 on The Gene Autry Show. By the early 1950s, Hale began to work in television. In 1952, he landed the starring role in CBS's Biff Baker, U.S.A.. The series was canceled in 1954. He continued his career on the small screen by appearing in guest spots on a variety of other series, such as The Range Rider (five times), Annie Oakley, Fireside Theater, Frontier, Matinee Theater, Fury, Northwest Passage, and The Man from Blackhawk. The year 1957 proved to be an especially busy one for Hale on television series. In addition to performing the role of Shawnee Bill on the Western Wanted Dead or Alive, he played a folksy rancher, Les Bridgeman, in \"Hired Gun\", an episode of the ABC/Warner Brothers series Cheyenne. Later that year Hale landed another starring role in the syndicated television series Casey Jones, which lasted for thirty-two half-hour episodes before its cancellation in 1958. Then, from 1958 to 1960, he was cast in a recurring role on Rory Calhoun's CBS Western The Texan. Hale also returned to the series Cheyenne in 1960 to portray the character Tuk in the episode \"Road to Three Graves\". Throughout the early 1960s, Hale continued in guest-starring roles on episodes of Gunsmoke, Bonanza, Rawhide, The Real McCoys, Mister Ed, Green Acres, Assignment: Underwater, Hawaiian Eye, Adventures in Paradise, Lock Up, The Andy Griffith Show, Lassie, Tales of Wells Fargo, Route 66 and 2 episodes of Hazel. He was featured in two episodes of Perry Mason, first as murderer Lon Snyder in the 1961 episode \"The Case of the Unwelcome Bride\", and then in 1963 as Nelson Barclift in \"The Case of the Bouncing Boomerang\". Despite his growing commitment to roles on television, Hale throughout the 1950s and into 1960s continued his work in supporting roles in feature films. Harold Young (November 13, 1897 – March 3, 1972) was an American film director, editor, and occasional actor. Born in Portland, Oregon, Young was active as a film editor from 1923-1934, working first on a series of George O'Hara short subjects under the director Malcolm St. Clair. Young's best-known early directorial assignment is probably \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" (1934), starring Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon, one example of his occasional work in Britain. He died on March 3, 1972, in Beverly Hills, California.  The Mummy's Tomb is a 1942 American horror film directed by Harold Young and starring Lon Chaney Jr. as Kharis the mummy. Taking place 30 years after the events of The Mummy's Hand, where Andoheb (George Zucco) has survived and plans revenge on Stephen Banning (Dick Foran) and his entire family in Mapleton, Massachusetts. With the help of the high priest Mehemet Bey (Turhan Bey), Andoheb and the mummy Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.) Bey takes up a job as a caretaker of a graveyard. At the first full moon, the mummy is fed tanna leaves which allow him to break into the Banning residence and kill the now elderly Stephen. Banning's son then seeks assistance from Babe Hanson (Wallace Ford), one of the members of the original Banning expedition to Egypt to stop Andoheb and Kharis. Lon Chaney Jr. had renewed his contract with Universal Pictures in 1942 and had his first role as the mummy Kharis in The Mummy's Tomb, a role he would reprise in the film's sequels The Mummy's Ghost and The Mummy's Curse. The film was shot between June 1 through mid-June 1942, not including footage taken from the previous film in the series The Mummy's Hand as well as Frankenstein.    Plot   Thirty years after discovering the tomb of Princess Ananka following a showdown with the living mummy of Ananka’s former lover Kharis, as well as his High Priest guardian Andoheb, Massachusetts archaeologist Steve Banning recounts the events to his family and evening guests in his home. As he concludes his narrative of the successful destruction of the creature, the scene switches back to the tombs of Egypt. Surviving their supposed demise, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to his follower, Mehemet Bey. After passing on the instructions for the use of the tana leaves, and assigning the task of terminating the remaining members of the Banning expedition and their descendants, Andoheb expires. Bey and Kharis leave Egypt for the journey to the United States. Bey takes the caretaker's job at the Mapleton cemetery, sets up shop, and administers the tana brew to Kharis. The monster sets out to avenge the desecration of Ananka's tomb. His first victim is Banning himself, whom the creature kills as the aging archaeologist prepares for bed. As the sheriff and coroner can't come up with a lead to the killer, newspapermen converge on Mapleton to learn more about the story. Babe Hanson arrives on the scene after learning of his friend's death. When Jane Banning, Steve's sister, is killed, Hanson is convinced it is the work of a mummy. Meeting with the sheriff and coroner, Hanson is unable to convince them of the identity of the culprit. He tells his story to a newspaperman at the local bar, but, after a chase and struggle, is himself dispatched by Kharis almost immediately afterwards.  Dr. John Banning, the son of Stephen Banning, enlists the help of Professor Norman to solve the puzzle of the \"grayish mark\" found on the victims' throats. Norman's test results prove that Hanson was right: the substance was indeed mold from a mummy. Meanwhile, Bey has plans of his own. Knowing that Banning and his girlfriend, Isobel Evans are planning to marry, he sets out to disrupt their nuptials. Bey himself has become smitten with Isobel, and sends Kharis on a mission to bring her to him. Kharis initially balks, but finally adheres to Bey's command. In the dark of the night, the monster stealthily enters the Evans's home and abducts the fainting girl to the cemetery caretaker's hut. Bey unveils his plan to the reluctant Isobel, that she is to become his bride, as a \"High Priest of Karnak\", and bear him an heir to the royal line. Banning and the rest of the townspeople have become convinced that their recent Egyptian immigrant may be involved in the crimes. Arriving in force, they confront Bey outside the hut. Kharis slips away with Isobel unbeknownst to the horde, and Bey attempts to shoot Banning, but is himself gunned down by the sheriff. The creature is observed heading toward the Banning estate, and the group begins pursuit, many bearing torches. Inside the home, Banning has a fight with Kharis and holds him at bay with a torch while he rescues Isobel from the mummy's grasp, but inadvertently sets fire to some curtains. With the aid of the sheriff and coroner, John and Isobel escape via a trellis as Kharis pursues them out onto the upstairs balcony. Rubber Racketeers is a 1942 American crime film directed by Harold Young and starring Ricardo Cortez and Rochelle Hudson.

In video games, artificial intelligence (AI) is used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent behaviors primarily in non-playable characters (NPCs) similar to human-like intelligence. Artificial intelligence has been an integral part of video games since their inception in the 1948, first seen in the game Nim. AI in video games is a distinct subfield and differs from academic AI. It serves to improve the game-player experience rather than machine learning or decision making. During the golden age of arcade video games the idea of AI opponents was largely popularized in the form of graduated difficulty levels, distinct movement patterns, and in-game events dependent on the player's input. Modern games often implement existing techniques such as pathfinding and decision trees to guide the actions of NPCs. AI is often used in mechanisms which are not immediately visible to the user, such as data mining and procedural-content generation. One of the most infamous examples of this NPC technology and gradual difficulty levels can be found in the game Punch-Out!!.    In general, game AI does not, as might be thought and sometimes is depicted to be the case, mean a realization of an artificial person corresponding to an NPC in the manner of the Turing test or an artificial general intelligence.    Overview  The term \"game AI\" is used to refer to a broad set of algorithms that also include techniques from control theory, robotics, computer graphics and computer science in general, and so video game AI may often not constitute \"true AI\" in that such techniques do not necessarily facilitate computer learning or other standard criteria, only constituting \"automated computation\" or a predetermined and limited set of responses to a predetermined and limited set of inputs. Many industries and corporate voices argue that game AI has come a long way in the sense that it has revolutionized the way humans interact with all forms of technology, although many expert researchers are skeptical of such claims, and particularly of the notion that such technologies fit the definition of \"intelligence\" standardly used in the cognitive sciences. Industry voices make the argument that AI has become more versatile in the way we use all technological devices for more than their intended purpose because the AI allows the technology to operate in multiple ways, allegedly developing their own personalities and carrying out complex instructions of the user. People in the field of AI have argued that video game AI is not true intelligence, but an advertising buzzword used to describe computer programs that use simple sorting and matching algorithms to create the illusion of intelligent behavior while bestowing software with a misleading aura of scientific or technological complexity and advancement. Since game AI for NPCs is centered on appearance of intelligence and good gameplay within environment restrictions, its approach is very different from that of traditional AI.    History  Game playing was an area of research in AI from its inception. One of the first examples of AI is the computerized game of Nim made in 1951 and published in 1952. Despite being advanced technology in the year it was made, 20 years before Pong, the game took the form of a relatively small box and was able to regularly win games even against highly skilled players of the game. In 1951, using the Ferranti Mark 1 machine of the University of Manchester, Christopher Strachey wrote a checkers program and Dietrich Prinz wrote one for chess. These were among the first computer programs ever written. Arthur Samuel's checkers program, developed in the middle 50s and early 60s, eventually achieved sufficient skill to challenge a respectable amateur. Work on checkers and chess would culminate in the defeat of Garry Kasparov by IBM's Deep Blue computer in 1997. The first video games developed in the 1960s and early 1970s, like Spacewar!, Pong, and Gotcha (1973), were games implemented on discrete logic and strictly based on the competition of two players, without AI. Games that featured a single player mode with enemies started appearing in the 1970s.  The first notable ones for the arcade appeared in 1974: the Taito game Speed Race (racing video game) and the Atari games Qwak (duck hunting light gun shooter) and Pursuit (fighter aircraft dogfighting simulator).  Two text-based computer games, Star Trek (1971) and Hunt the Wumpus (1973), also had enemies.  Enemy movement was based on stored patterns. The incorporation of microprocessors would allow more computation and random elements overlaid into movement patterns.  It was during the golden age of video arcade games that the idea of AI opponents was largely popularized, due to the success of Space Invaders (1978), which sported an increasing difficulty level, distinct movement patterns, and in-game events dependent on hash functions based on the player's input. Galaxian (1979) added more complex and varied enemy movements, including maneuvers by individual enemies who break out of formation. Pac-Man (1980) introduced AI patterns to maze games, with the added quirk of different personalities for each enemy.

Sylvia Alice Earle (born August 30, 1935) is an American marine biologist, oceanographer, explorer, author, and lecturer. She has been a National Geographic Explorer at Large (formerly Explorer in Residence) since 1998. Earle was the first female chief scientist of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and was named by Time Magazine as its first Hero for the Planet in 1998. Earle is part of the group Ocean Elders, which is dedicated to protecting the ocean and its wildlife. Earle gained a large amount of publicity when she was featured in Seaspiracy (2021), a Netflix Original documentary by British filmmaker Ali Tabrizi. Earle eats a vegetarian diet. She describes the chemical buildup in carnivorous fish, the 90% depletion of populations of large fish, and references the health of oceans in her dietary decision. Also, she describes the seafood industry as “factory ships vacuuming up fish and everything else in their path. That’s like using bulldozers to kill songbirds…”. In a discussion at the Good Food Conference in California, Earle warns of disappearing fish stocks, and that while coastal people's diets have included seafood for centuries, the commercial fishing industry no longer makes sense. She encourages transitions to plant-based diets as a solution.    Early life and education  Earle was born in 1935 in the Gibbstown section of Greenwich Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey, to Alice Freas (Richie) Earle and Lewis Reade Earle. Both her parents were enthusiastic about the outdoors and supportive of their daughter's early interests in the natural world. The family moved to Dunedin on the western coast of Florida during Earle's childhood. Earle received an associate degree from St. Petersburg Jr. College (1952), a Bachelor of Science degree from Florida State University (1955), a Master of Science (1956) and a Doctorate of Phycology (1966) from Duke University. Sylvia Earle life work has been shaped directly by Rachel Carson, whose talent she rhapsodizes about in the Introduction to the 2018 edition of Carson's 1951 best-seller, The Sea Around Us. “Most remarkable to me is what she did imagine. Her writings are so sensitive to the feelings of fish, birds and other animals that she could put herself in their place, buoyed by the air or by water, gliding over and under the ocean’s surface. She conveyed the sense that she was the living ocean…”    Career  Earle was a Radcliffe Institute Scholar (1967–1969). Earle was a research fellow at Harvard University (1967–1981). After receiving her Ph.D. in 1966, Earle spent a year as a research fellow at Harvard, then returned to Florida as the resident director of the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory. Earle was a research associate at the University of California, Berkeley (1969–1981). In 1969, she applied to join the Tektite Project, an installation fifty feet below the surface of the sea off the coast of the Virgin Islands which allowed scientists to live submersed in their area of study for up to several weeks. Although she had logged more than 1,000 research hours underwater, Earle was rejected from the program. The next year, she was selected to lead the first all-female team of aquanauts in Tektite II. Earle was the Curator of Phycology at the California Academy of Sciences (1979–1986). In 1979, she made an open-ocean JIM suit dive, untethered, to the sea ocean floor near Oahu. She set the women's depth record of 381 metres (1,250 ft) which still holds to date. In 1979 she also began her tenure as the Curator of Phycology at the California Academy of Sciences, where she served until 1986. From 1980 to 1984, she served on the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere.  In 1982 she and her later husband, Graham Hawkes, an engineer and submersible designer, founded Deep Ocean Engineering to design, operate, support and consult on piloted and robotic subsea systems. In 1985, the Deep Ocean Engineering team designed and built the Deep Rover research submarine, which operates down to 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). By 1986, Deep Rover had been tested and Earle joined the team conducting training off Lee Stocking Island in the Bahamas. Earle left the company in 1990 to accept an appointment as Chief Scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where she stayed until 1992. She was the first woman to hold that position.

SV Wehen Wiesbaden is a German association football club based in Wiesbaden, Hesse. The club was previously known as SV Wehen but added  Wiesbaden to its name during the summer of 2007. They left their previous ground, the Taunusstein, that same summer and have played at the BRITA-Arena ever since. Wehen will compete in the 2024-25 3. Liga season, having been relegated from the 2. Bundesliga in 2023-24.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Amateur Football (1926–1994) ===\n\nThe club was founded under the name of SV Wehen 1926 – Taunusstein in 1926 and disbanded by the Nazi government in 1933, although the football department was maintained by playing occasional friendly matches until 1939. The club re-established itself in 1946, following World War II. They operated both first and reserve teams from the beginning, with their first team competing in local amateur division, the B-Klasse Wiesbaden. The club's first youth team was established in 1955 and they subsequently started to use their own talented young players to strengthen the first team. By the mid-1970s, the youth department was split in ten teams with more than 150 players and a women's team was first established in 1984. Wehen won the Hessenpokal in 1988, 1996 and 2000, which gave them berths in the German Cup in those years.\n\n\n=== Third Tier and upwards (1994–) ===\n\nIn 1994, the third tier of German football underwent a reform which resulted in the elevation of the Regionalliga. Wehen had finished seventh in the Oberliga Hessen in the previous year and thus became a founding member of the Regionalliga Süd. In spite of its relegation in 1995, the club managed to establish itself in the newly founded league over the next ten years.\nAt the end of the 2006–07 season, Wehen finished first and earned promotion to the 2.Bundesliga. Its first second-tier season saw the club finish eighth and the inauguration of its current home, Brita-Arena. In spite of a berth in the DFB Pokal quarterfinals, Wehen was relegated to the 3. Liga in 2009, which would remain the club's division for the next ten seasons.\nWehen achieved a third-place finish at the end of the 2018–19 season and thereby qualified for the promotion playoffs to the 2.Bundesliga against FC Ingolstadt. After a 1–2 defeat in their home game, the team managed to carry a 3–2 victory on Ingolstadt's turf. Advancing on away goals, Wehen was promoted to the 2. Bundesliga for only the second time in club history. However, the club experienced a difficult 2019–20 season and finished in 17th place, fielding the league's worst defence with 65 goals conceded. Along with Dynamo Dresden, Wehen were relegated after just one season in the second tier.\nOn 6 June 2023, Wehen Wiesbaden secured promotion to 2. Bundesliga from 2023 to 2024 after defeating Arminia Bielefeld on aggregate 6–1 in the promotion/relegation play-off matches and returned to the second tier after three years absence.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== Current squad ===\nAs of 7 August 2024\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

        "answer": "29 January 1745",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When is George Lamb (Politician)'s father's birthday?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nElizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne (née Milbanke; 1751 – 1818) was one of the most influential of the political hostesses of the extended Regency period, and the wife of Whig politician Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne. She was the mother of William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and several other influential children. Lady Melbourne was known for her political influence and her friendships and romantic relationships with other members of the English aristocracy, including Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, and George, Prince of Wales. Because of her numerous love affairs, the paternity of several of her children is a matter of dispute.    Early life and marriage  Elizabeth Milbanke was baptised on 15 October 1751, in the village of Croft-on-Tees, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. She was the youngest child and only daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, 5th Baronet, and his wife, Elizabeth (née Hedworth). She had two brothers, with the eldest being Ralph Noel—future Foxite Whig politician and 6th Baronet. The family resided at Halnaby Hall, Yorkshire. Elizabeth's father was a politician and her maternal grandfather was John Hedworth, a Member of Parliament for County Durham. Elizabeth was privately educated and learned French and poetry composition. Her mother died in 1767. Two years later, Elizabeth met Sir Peniston Lamb, 2nd Baronet; they married in London on 13 April 1769. The couple lived at Melbourne House in Piccadilly and Elizabeth quickly became a well-known figure in London Whig society. She was apparently untroubled by her husband's infidelity early in their marriage with the actress and courtesan, Sophia Baddeley, just as he came to tolerate her numerous love affairs. Peniston was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Lord Melbourne, Baron of Kilmore, in 1770, and Viscount Melbourne, in 1781. As well as Melbourne House, the family had country residences at Brocket Hall, in Hertfordshire, and Melbourne Hall, in Derbyshire.    Personal relationships   From the start of her marriage, the shrewd and coldly pragmatic Lady Melbourne cultivated friendships that helped her position in society, and her husband's career. These relationships were frequently with men, some of whom became lovers. She was noted for discretion in her affairs: she famously remarked that no man was safe with another's secrets and no woman with her own. Unlike her daughter-in-law, Lady Caroline Lamb, who conducted a very public extramarital affair with Lord Byron, Lady Melbourne had a clear understanding of what society would and would not condone. She was highly intelligent, if not intellectual; it was said of her that, within the rather narrow limits of her experience, her knowledge of the world was remarkable. She was a devoted mother and worked tirelessly to advance the careers of all her children, especially William. Lord David Cecil remarked that few children have had a better mother, although her reputation for immorality caused them some distress: George once came to blows with a friend who said  \"your mother is a whore\". William, though admitting that his mother's private life was not blameless, called her \"the most sagacious woman [he] ever knew\" and remarked that \"she kept me straight as long as she lived\". After the marriage in 1774 of Lady Georgiana Spencer to William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, Lady Melbourne became a close friend of and personal advisor to the Duchess. Until this point, Lady Melbourne had enjoyed unrivalled success as a political hostess and quickly recognised that the young duchess, with a higher rank and better connections, would be a more valuable friend than a rival. The two women were painted, alongside their friend, sculptor Anne Damer, by Daniel Gardner as the Three Witches in his 1775 painting Witches Round the Cauldron. Lady Melbourne featured as the character of Lady Besford in the Duchess' novel The Sylph. By contrast, she and the Duchess' sister, Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough, disliked each other intensely, and Lady Melbourne's enmity later extended to Henrietta's daughter, Lady Caroline Lamb. True to her practical nature, she did not allow this dislike to interfere with her support for her son William's marriage to Caroline, which was a  social step up for the Lamb family, who were still, by the strict social standards of the age, considered to be newcomers to polite society. By the late 1770s, Lady Melbourne was romantically involved with George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont. Edmund George Lamb MA FCS FRGS( 8 July 1863 – 3 January 1925) was an English landowner, colliery proprietor, and radical Liberal Party politician.

George Lamb (born 1979) is an English radio and TV presenter.\nGeorge Lamb may also refer to:\n\nGeorge Lamb (politician) (1784–1834), British member of parliament and writer\nGeorge Hamilton Lamb (1900–1943), Australian politician and prisoner-of-war\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeorge Lam (born 1947), Hong Kong singer Henry William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne   (15 March 1779 – 24 November 1848) was a British Whig politician who served as the Home Secretary and twice as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. His first premiership ended when he was dismissed by King William IV in 1834, the last British prime minister to be dismissed by a monarch. Five months later, he was re-appointed and served for six more years, into the reign of Queen Victoria. He is best known for coaching the Queen in the ways of politics, acting almost as her private secretary, and the political scandals that resulted from it. His legacy as prime minister was not favourable, as he had no great foreign wars or domestic issues to handle, and he was involved in several political scandals in the early years of Victoria's reign.    Early life  In 1779, William Lamb was born in London to an aristocratic Whig family, and was the son of Peniston and Elizabeth Lamb (1751–1818). However, his paternity was questioned, being attributed to George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, to whom it was considered he bore a considerable resemblance, and at whose residence he was a visitor until the Earl's death. Lamb was called to Egremont's bedside when Egremont was dying but, nevertheless, stated that Egremont being his father was \"all a lie\". Lamb was educated at Eton, then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in 1796 and graduated a Master of Arts in 1799, and finally at the University of Glasgow (1799–1801), where he was a resident pupil of Professor John Millar alongside his younger brother Frederick. Admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1797, Lamb was called to the bar in 1804. Against the background of the Napoleonic Wars, Lamb served at home as Captain (1803) and Major (1804) in the Hertfordshire Volunteer Infantry. Lamb succeeded his elder brother Peniston as heir to his father's title in 1805 (and as captain of the Midland Troop, Hertfordshire Yeomanry, when he resigned his commission in the Volunteer Infantry) and married Lady Caroline Ponsonby, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat. After two miscarriages and a stillbirth child, she gave birth to George Augustus Frederick in 1807 and was devoted to him. George was epileptic and mentally handicapped, requiring significant medical care. He died in 1836. In 1809, they had a daughter. She was born prematurely and lived only one day.    Early political career     Election to Parliament  The following year, Lamb was elected to the British House of Commons as the Whig MP for Leominster. For the election in 1806 he moved to the seat of Haddington Burghs, and for the 1807 election he successfully stood for Portarlington (a seat he held until 1812). Lamb first came to general notice for reasons he would rather have avoided: his wife had a public affair with Lord Byron – she coined the famous characterisation of Byron as \"mad, bad and dangerous to know\". The resulting scandal was the talk of Britain in 1812. Lady Caroline published a Gothic novel, Glenarvon, in 1816; this portrayed both the marriage and her affair with Byron in a lurid fashion, which caused William even greater embarrassment, while the spiteful caricatures of leading society figures made them several influential enemies. Eventually the two were reconciled, and, though they separated in 1825, her death in 1828 affected him considerably.    Member of Parliament   In 1816, Lamb was returned for Peterborough by Whig grandee Lord Fitzwilliam. He told Lord Holland that he was committed to the Whig principles of the Glorious Revolution but not to \"a heap of modern additions, interpolations, facts and fictions\". He, therefore, spoke against parliamentary reform, and voted for the suspension of habeas corpus in 1817 when sedition was rife. Lamb's hallmark was finding the middle ground. Though a Whig, he accepted the post of Chief Secretary for Ireland in the moderate Tory governments of George Canning and Lord Goderich on 29 April 1827. Upon the death of his father in 1828 and his becoming the 2nd Viscount Melbourne, of Kilmore in the County of Cavan, he moved to the House of Lords. He had spent 25 years in the Commons, largely as a backbencher, and was not politically well known.    Home Secretary  In November 1830, the Whigs came to power under Lord Grey. Melbourne was Home Secretary. During the disturbances of 1830–32 he \"acted both vigorously and sensitively, and it was for this function that his reforming brethren thanked him heartily\". Mark Lamb (born July 14, 1972) is an American law enforcement officer and politician who has served as sheriff of Pinal County, Arizona, since 2017. He is a member of the Republican Party.  Lamb previously served in the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community police department. \nHe ran unopposed for re-election as sheriff in 2020, and is a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2024 looking to replace incumbent independent Kyrsten Sinema, after Sinema declined to seek re-election.\n\n\n== Career ==\nLamb worked for the police department of the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community for six years. In 2012, he joined the Pinal County Sheriff's Office. In 2017, Lamb was elected to succeed Paul Babeu as Pinal County Sheriff.\nPrior to its cancellation in 2020, Lamb frequently appeared on the TV series Live PD. Lamb also hosted Live PD: Wanted, a spinoff show. In 2019, he also featured in Season 5 of 60 Days In, in which seven volunteers went undercover in the Pinal County Jail for 60 days to collect insight into jail operations. Lamb frequently appears on Fox News and Newsmax TV.\nIn November 2019, Lamb called for increased security along the Mexico–United States border to combat drug cartels from harming U.S. National Parks.\nIn May 2020, Lamb stated he would not enforce a stay-at-home order during the COVID-19 pandemic on the basis that he believed it was unconstitutional. In June 2020, he tested positive for COVID-19 a week before his scheduled appearance at the White House for Donald Trump's signing of executive order 13925.\nIn July 2020, in response to the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Lamb announced his intention to form a civilian posse of non-felon volunteers with four hours of training in legal guidelines and basic police tactics. No protests occurred in Pinal County in summer 2020.\nIn 2018, Lamb established the American Sheriff Foundation, a charity. In August 2020, The Arizona Republic reported that the charity had raised more than $50,000 but left at least $18,000 unaccounted for and filed largely blank tax filings.\nIn 2020, Lamb spoke at a convention of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, an organization that holds the fringe legal theory that sheriffs are the supreme legal authority in the United States and are not required to enforce laws they believe to be unconstitutional. He has also appeared alongside the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which is described as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nLamb ran unopposed for re-election in November 2020 after successfully suing to remove his competition from the ballot.\nLamb is a supporter of the Stop the Steal movement. Following the 2021 United States Capitol attack by supporters of Donald Trump, he spoke at a rally where he said the riot was not Trump's fault but rather caused by \"the other issues that have happened – the Hillary Clintons that have gone unpunished\". He later described the rioters as \"very loving, Christian people.\"\nIn February 2021, Lamb co-founded (with Republican strategist Nathan Sproul and others) Protect America Now, a coalition of 69 sheriffs with the stated purpose of \"educating Americans about how our Sheriffs and the law enforcement community are standing for our Constitution and law and order\". In May 2021, Lamb launched the American Sheriff Network, a subscription service providing videos showing sheriffs and their deputies carrying out their duties.\nLamb is the author of American Sheriff: Traditional Values in a Modern World, which was self-published.\nIn December 2022, a spokesperson for Lamb said he was considering running for the U.S. Senate in 2024. In April 2023 Lamb announced he would run for the seat currently held by incumbent Democrat-turned Independent Kyrsten Sinema. In July 2024, Lamb was defeated in the Republican primary by Kari Lake.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLamb spent much of his childhood in Hawaii and also lived in the Philippines, Panama and Argentina. He moved to Arizona in 2003, after his paintball business in Utah failed and he filed for bankruptcy. Before he began his career in law enforcement, he graduated from high school and worked in pest control. \nLamb's wife, Janel, is the author of a book titled The Sheriff's Wife, and frequently appears alongside him at public events. \nOn December 16, 2022, Lamb's son, Cooper, daughter-in-law, and infant granddaughter died in a traffic collision in Gilbert, Arizona.\nLamb is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nMark Lamb at IMDb The Hon. George Lamb( 11 July 1784 – 2 January 1834) was a British politician and writer. The youngest son of Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne, and his wife Elizabeth, and the brother of William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, Frederick Lamb, 3rd Viscount Melbourne, and Emily Lamb, Countess Cowper, he was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in 1805. On 17 May 1809, he married Caroline Rosalie Adelaide St. Jules, the illegitimate daughter of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, by his mistress( and eventual second wife) Lady Elizabeth Foster. In 1805 his brother William had married Caroline's cousin Lady Caroline Ponsonby, whose affair with the poet Lord Byron led her to describe him as\" mad, bad, and dangerous to know\". The Lambs had no children and it was speculated that the marriage was never consummated. He became a barrister at Lincoln's Inn, and was Member of Parliament for Westminster from March 1819 to March 1820, and for Dungarvan from 1822 until his death. He served in Earl Grey's administration as Under- Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1830 until his death. His comic opera\" Whistle for it\" was produced in 1807, and his adaptations of Timon of Athens in 1816. His most important work, a translation of the poems of Catullus, was published in 1821. The Hon. George Lamb  (11 July 1784 – 2 January 1834) was a British politician and writer.\nHe was the youngest son of Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne, and his wife Elizabeth. Also, brother of William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, Frederick Lamb, 3rd Viscount Melbourne, and Emily Lamb, Countess Cowper. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA in 1805.\nHowever, due to his mother's numerous love affairs, George's true paternity is a matter of debate. It is widely rumored that George's biological father was George IV (then the Prince of Wales), who acted as George Lamb's godfather.\nOn 17 May 1809, he married Caroline Rosalie Adelaide St. Jules, the illegitimate daughter of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, by his mistress (and eventual second wife) Lady Elizabeth Foster. In 1805 his brother William had married Caroline's cousin Lady Caroline Ponsonby, whose affair with the poet Lord Byron led her to describe him as \"mad, bad, and dangerous to know\".\nThe Lambs had no children and it was speculated that the marriage was never consummated. George would neglect Caroline St. Jules by retiring to bed early to avoid sleeping with his wife. George found his wife to be a distraction from his theatre/literary career. Their marriage was almost in shambles. In 1816, Caroline St. Jules had an affair with Henry Brougham. In addition, Caroline St. Jules felt trapped in a marriage where her husband was neglectful and a drunk.\nCaroline St. Jules would confess her marital problems to her mother, Lady Elizabeth Foster. Lady Elizabeth Foster could not see Caroline St. Jules’ and George Lamb's marital problems in any positive light. Lady Elizabeth Foster was disappointed in George's treatment of Caroline and believed him to be \"some kind of monster.\"\nYet, Caroline St. Jules and George Lamb's marriage seemed to work out as time went on. Eventually, Caroline St. Jules and Henry Brougham ended their affair. Caroline reconciled with her husband, and they stayed together until George Lamb's death in 1834. Even though Caroline St. Jules outlived George Lamb by almost 28 years, she never remarried. Caroline St. Jules died in 1862.\nGeorge Lamb became a barrister at Lincoln's Inn, and was Member of Parliament for Westminster from March 1819 to March 1820, and for Dungarvan from 1822 until his death. He served in Earl Grey's administration as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1830 until his death.\nGeorge Lamb's comic opera Whistle for it was produced in 1807, and his adaptations of Timon of Athens in 1816. His most important work, a translation of the poems of Catullus, was published in 1821. Pamela Jain is an Indian playback singer. Date of Birth:16th March. Terence D.

He was the father of Prime Minister William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne. == Early life ==\nLamb was the son of Sir Matthew Lamb, 1st Baronet, and his wife Charlotte (née Coke). He was educated at Eton College from 1755 to 1762 and entered Lincoln's Inn in 1769. He succeeded in the baronetcy on his father's death on 6 November 1768 and inherited Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire. He married Elizabeth Milbanke (1751–1818), daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, 5th Baronet, on 13 April 1769. She was a young woman of great beauty, intelligence and strong character, who quickly came to dominate her husband completely, and steered them into the centre of polite society. In 1770 he began, as Melbourne House, what is now The Albany in London.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nAt the 1768 general election Lamb was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Ludgershall. In 1770 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Lord Melbourne, Baron of Kilmore, in the County of Cavan, but as it was an Irish peerage he was allowed to remain in the House of Commons. He was returned unopposed again as MP for Ludgershall at the elections in 1774 and 1780. In 1781 he was created Viscount Melbourne, of Kilmore in the County of Cavan, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was appointed Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales in 1783 and held the position until 1796. At the 1784 general election he stood for Malmesbury and was again returned unopposed. He switched again in 1790 and was returned unopposed at Newport, Isle of Wight. He resigned his seat in 1793 for his son Peniston.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nLord Melbourne became Lord of the Bedchamber in 1812. In 1815 he was even further honoured when he was made Baron Melbourne, of Melbourne in the County of Derby, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He died on 22 July 1828, aged 83 and was succeeded in his titles by his son William.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nMelbourne and his wife had seven children.\n\nHon. Peniston Lamb (3 May 1770 – 24 January 1805)\nElizabeth Lamb (born 25 October 1777)\nWilliam Lamb (15 March 1779 – 24 November 1848), 2nd Viscount Melbourne\nFrederick James Lamb (17 April 1782 – 29 January 1853), 3rd Viscount Melbourne\nHon. George Lamb (11 July 1784 – 2 January 1834)\nEmily Lamb, Countess Cowper (1787–1869)\nHarriet Lamb (1789-1803)\nOnly the first-born son can be definitively attributed to Lord Melbourne due to his wife's many affairs. George is reputed to be the son of George IV, with William and Emily allegedly fathered by Lord Egremont.\nWhether Melbourne was made unhappy by his wife's affairs is unclear: he was a mild, easygoing and rather stupid man who avoided trouble, and invariably deferred to his wife, who was by far the stronger and more intelligent partner in the marriage. Their one serious quarrel was caused by the death of their eldest son Pen (who was undoubtedly Melbourne's child); he angrily refused to make the same allowance to William (who was almost certainly not Melbourne's child) as he had given Pen, suggesting that he felt some degree of resentment of his wife's conduct. Lady Melbourne, on her side, tolerated his affair with the courtesan Sophia Baddeley. Nathaniel Wraxall wrote of Melbourne that he was \"principally known by the distinguished place that he occupies in the annals of meretricious pleasure, the memoirs of Mrs. Bellamy or Mrs. Baddeley, the sirens and courtesans of a former age\".\nMelbourne's children regarded him with what has been described as \"kindly contempt\": his daughter Emily said that he was always going wrong and they were always having to put him right, and that although he was not a heavy drinker, he always seemed drunk. Brian Saunders( date of birth and death unknown) was a male weightlifter who competed for England. Viscount Melbourne, of Kilmore in the County of Cavan, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland held by the Lamb family.\nThis family descended from Matthew Lamb, who represented Stockbridge and Peterborough in the House of Commons. In 1755 he was created a baronet, of Brocket Hall in the County of Hertford, in the Baronetage of Great Britain. He married Charlotte, daughter of Thomas Coke, through which marriage Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire came into the Lamb family.\nHe was succeeded by his son, Peniston, the second Baronet, who sat as Member of Parliament for Ludgershall, Malmesbury and Newport, Isle of Wight, and who, in 1770, was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Lord Melbourne, Baron of Kilmore, in the County of Cavan. In 1781, he was created Viscount Melbourne, of Kilmore in the County of Cavan, also in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1815, he was made Baron Melbourne, of Melbourne in the County of Derby, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.\nHe was succeeded by his son, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who was a noted Whig politician and served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1834 and 1835–1841. He was Queen Victoria's first Prime Minister, and she greatly relied upon his wisdom and experience in her early days on the throne, to the point where Melbourne's political foes complained that he had enthralled her. Since Melbourne's mother had numerous lovers, it is very doubtful that he was in fact the first Viscount's son.\nOn his death, the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Viscount, who was a prominent diplomat. In 1839, nine years before he succeeded his brother, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Beauvale, of Beauvale in the County of Nottingham. All five titles became extinct on his death in 1853.\nThe Honourable George Lamb, fourth and youngest son of the first Viscount, was also a politician.\n\n\n== Viscounts Melbourne (1781) ==\nPeniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne (1748–1828)\nHon.

Frederick James Lamb, 3rd Viscount Melbourne,  (17 April 1782 – 29 January 1853), known as The Lord Beauvale from 1839 to 1848, was a British diplomat.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nLamb was a younger son of Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne, and his wife Elizabeth Milbanke, and the younger brother of Prime Minister William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne. Since his mother had numerous lovers, his real paternity is a matter of conjecture.\nLamb was educated at Eton College; the University of Glasgow (1799–1801, studying with Professor John Millar alongside his older brother William); and Trinity College, Cambridge (admitted 1801, graduated M.A. 1803).\nWilliam, Frederick and their sister Emily Lamb, Countess Cowper remained close all their lives, although Frederick and Emily disliked William's wife Lady Caroline Lamb, whom they called \"the little beast\".\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe served as British Ambassador to Vienna ending in 1841. He was invested as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath and admitted to the Privy Council in 1822. In 1839 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Beauvale, of Beauvale in the County of Nottingham. In 1848 he succeeded his elder brother as third Viscount Melbourne.\nDespite a certain personal distance between them, Lord Palmerston, as Foreign Secretary placed great confidence in Lamb, wrote to him in a courteous style very different from his usual brusque manner, and left the running of the Vienna Embassy almost entirely in his hands. The coolness was due to Palmerston's decades-long affair with Lamb's sister Emily, Lady Cowper; Lamb disapproved of the affair and disapproved equally of their eventual marriage, although this proved to be very happy. Palmerston's biographer notes that the marriage coincided with the early stages of the Oriental Crisis of 1840, and that the two men, although they were then personally barely on speaking terms, co-operated in an entirely professional way to resolve it. Palmerston, in addition to his real respect for Lamb, was anxious not to quarrel with him for Emily's sake: as Charles Greville remarked: \"the Chief (Palmerston) is devoted to the sister and the sister to the brother\". Relations between the two men became friendlier in later years, partly because both Palmerston and Emily were fond of Frederick's wife Alexandrina.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nIn 1841, Lord Beauvale married Alexandrina Julia Theresa Wilhelmina Sophia Gräfin von Maltzan (1818–1894), daughter of Joachim Charles Leslie Mortimer, Graf von Maltzan. It was generally considered to be a love marriage: even though Alexandrina was more than thirty years her husband's junior, he was described as being \"as handsome and debonair at sixty as he had been at twenty-five.\" \nLord Melbourne died childless in January 1853, aged 70, and all his titles became extinct. The family seat of Melbourne Hall passed to his sister Emily. His widow remarried in 1856 to John Weld-Forester, 2nd Baron Forester, was widowed again in 1873, and died in 1894. There is a memorial to him in St Paul's Cathedral.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nLeigh Rayment's Peerage Pages   \n\n\n== External links ==\nPortrait (1846)\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Two of them had a very short accidental acquaintance earlier which makes them easier to be friends. One day a young girl comes to the place and asks to meet Sukumaran. Anirudhan and one of his friends assume that she might be the girlfriend of Sukumaran. Later they make fun of Sukumaran and thinks that he hides something from them. Some days later the same girl arrives there again. From the appearance of Anirudhan the girl mistakes him for a servant. To their surprise Sukumaran announces that she is her only sister not any girlfriend the way they think. They go with their daily routines when a telegraph arrives with the news that Anirudhan’s grandmother is ill. Anirudhan decides to leave for home at the earliest. Sukumaran also joins him. At home he finds his grandmother got injured from a small fall but nothing to worry. He introduces his friend Sukumaran to the family. Sukumaran behaves easily like one of their family members. Anirudhan’s sister Sujatha gradually likes his character and she is drawn to him. After Sukumaran’s return from Anirudhan’s home he tells he is in love with Sujatha to their roommate Ravi. Ravi arranges a meeting with Anirudhan and it becomes a marriage proposal. Anirudhan, finding no problem with the alliance agrees to the same and his sister Sujatha also. In between this Sukumaran comes with a proposal of his sister for Anirudhan. Marriages of the two friends with their sisters take place soon. In the initial time after marriage Anirudhan experiences small amounts of classism & cultural shock from Neelima in terms of usage of contraceptive pills and her discomfort to be in a typical village house. His sister Sujatha also experiences similar experiences from Sukumaran from his urban model lifestyle. To Sukumaran and Neelima the new environment and their partners’ styles are not that challenging, at least for the time being. The family situations becomes even more tensed when further cultural clashes come between the two couples. One day Anirudhan’s and Sukumaran’s mutual friend Ravi comes to Anirudhan’s home. In order to rekindle their friendship Ravi introduces the idea to consume alcohol at the home. To this Anirudhan opposes but with this Neelima finds no problem. Ravi feeling insulted reaches Sukumaran’s home but here he is encouraged to go with the earlier idea although Sukumaran’s wife Sujatha has a slightly different opinion regarding the matter. Some days later Sukumaran finds his wife conceived but feels shame for the early pregnancy and also thinks that it will curtail their freedom. Meanwhile, at Anirudhan’s family Neelima is very conscious about not getting pregnant because of her city life style which might be tarnished if she got pregnant thus fast. Anirudhan finds this difficult but somehow tries to be supportive with Neelima’s decisions. Neelima then tells Anirudhan that she has gotten a job opportunity in an institution where she studied as a tutor. But Anirudhan because of his conservative and complex nature turns down her plan to join the post. Another day her parents come to their home and tells him about a job opportunity that might fetch him good fortune abroad. They also tell him that when he is abroad Neelima can continue here by joining for the job opportunity she has gotten. This infuriates Anirudhan and he thinks that he is being set-upped by her parents. He make her know that he has gotten a comparatively good job with which he can manage the family. Rajagopala Kulashekharan or R. K. Shekhar (21 June 1933 – 09 September 1976) was an Indian music composer who worked mainly for Malayalam movies. He composed music for 52 films (23 in Malayalam with 127 songs), and was the music conductor for more than 100 films. He is the father of music composers and singers A. R. Rahman and A. R. Reihana. His grandsons G. V. Prakash Kumar and A. R. Ameen are also involved in music production. His debut song as a music director was \"Chotta Muthal Chudala Vare\" (\"from cradle to grave\"), which was a big hit in Kerala. This was composed for the film Pazhassi Raja (1964).    Early life  He was born to a Tamil Thuluva velala Mudaliar family in Gudiyatham to K. Rajagopalan also known as Rajagopalan Bhagavathar, a harikathai exponent. His entry into film music was opened through his extraordinary performances on harmonium for theatre plays. He started his career in the film industry as an assistant to music director M. B. Sreenivasan. Later on he conducted and arranged music for famous Malayalam music directors M. K. Arjunan and V. Dakshinamoorthy. He was so fascinated by the tunes created by these legends, that he would work very hard single-handedly to create the BGM of the songs they tuned to match their purity and standard, thus making the songs evergreen and on par. Their association lasted till his death.    Career  His career as an independent music composer started with the 1964 film Pazhassi Raja, of which the philosophical song \"Chotta Muthal Chudala Vare\" became a big hit. After his next work in Aisha, he turned back to arranging and conducting for other composers. After a gap of 7 years, he returned to music composing through the film Anaathashilpangal in 1971. Apart from arranging the hits like Ninmaniarayile and Neela Nishidhini C.I.D. Nazir 1971 for director P. Venu, he composed music for his next film Taxi Car in 1972. Then he went on to compose music for about 20 films. Due to the failure of these films in the box office, his songs went unnoticed and he lacked to get more opportunities for composing. His close friend in the industry was composer M. K. Arjunan. Starting from Arjunan master's first film, Shekhar assisted him in all his films till his death. Continuous hard work made Shekhar's health condition worse. In all these days, Arjunan master was the caretaker of him and his family. He composed tunes for his last film  Chottanikkara Amma when he was in bed for treatment and he died leaving the project incomplete. Later on, M.K. Arjunan completed the project by arranging and recording the songs that Shekhar composed.    Family  R. K. Shekhar was married to Kasthuri Shekhar (later Kareema Begum; d. 2020). Their marriage took place in the most prominent Hindu shrine in India, the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple located in Tirupati. Shekhar and Kasthuri had four children, A. R. Reihana, Allah Rakha Rahman (born A. S. Dileep Kumar), Fathima Rafiq and Ishrath Qadri. Shekhar died on 9th September 1976 at the young age of 43. His grandchildren include Reihana's son G.V. Prakash Kumar and Rahman's son A. R. Raju Mathew (c. 1937 – 12 November 2019) was an Indian film producer from Kerala. He produced 45 films. He was the owner of Century Films.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMathew worked in an insurance company before coming to the film arena. Later he gave up the job and established Century Films in 1979.

        "answer": "no",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Are director of film The Actors and director of film Liar Liar from the same country?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nI Am is a 2010 American documentary film written, directed, and narrated by Tom Shadyac. The film asks the question: \"What is wrong with the world, and what can we do about it?\", and explores Shadyac's personal journey after a bicycling accident in 2007 which led him to the answers \"the nature of humanity\", \"the world's ever-growing addiction to materialism\", and \"human connections\". Shot with Shadyac and a team of four, the film contrasts sharply with the director's most notable comedic works, such as Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Liar Liar, and Bruce Almighty, all of which he collaborated with Canadian comic actor Jim Carrey.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTom Shadyac suffered post-concussion syndrome after a bicycle accident in Virginia in 2007, experiencing months of acute headaches and hyper-sensitivity to light and noise. He slept in a closet due to chronic tinnitus that lasted more than six months. It was this constant ringing that the doctors could not treat that led him to suicidal thoughts. The injury followed the cumulative effects of previous mild head injuries Shadyac had suffered surfing, mountain biking and playing basketball.\nIn 2011, a New York Times article stated that \"the symptoms of a concussion [didn't] go away. Something as simple as a trip to the grocery store was painful for Shadyac, whose brain was unable to filter various stimuli. Shadyac subsequently gave away his excess fortune, opening a homeless shelter in Charlottesville, Virginia and making a key donation to Telluride, Colorado's effort to set aside a natural area at the town's entrance.  He reoriented and simplified his life, sold his 17,000-square-foot (1,600 m2) Los Angeles mansion and moved into a trailer park – albeit the exclusive Paradise Cove park in Malibu. As medical treatments failed to help, he isolated himself completely, sleeping in his closet and walling the windows of his mobile home with black-out curtains. Later, as his symptoms finally began to subside, the director wanted to share his inner quest in the way he knew best: through film.\" Shadyac linked the experience to Dante's Seventh Circle of Hell.\n\n\n== Film context ==\nIn the film, Shadyac conducts interviews with scientists, religious leaders, environmentalists and philosophers including Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Lynne McTaggart, Elisabet Sahtouris, David Suzuki, Howard Zinn, and Thom Hartmann. The film asks two central questions: What’s Wrong With the World? and What Can We Do About it?. It is about \"human connectedness, happiness, and the human spirit\", and explores themes including Darwinism, Western mores, loneliness, the economy, and the drive to war. The documentary includes animated scenes explaining scientific concepts, as well as clips from the films Wall Street and It's a Wonderful Life.\nProceeds from the documentary went to the Foundation for I Am, which supports various charities.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 47 reviews, with an average rating of 5.16/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"I Am is undeniably well-meaning - and unfortunately proof that a filmmaker's best intentions aren't enough to guarantee a worthwhile viewing experience.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\nThe Los Angeles Times said the film was \"a collection of sound bites that validate the filmmaker's point of view. What lifts the film above its dubious boilerplate assemblage of talking heads and archival images is Shadyac himself. With his gentle, self-mocking humor, he comes across as an exceptionally mellow, earnest and likable guy.\" Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a mixed review, awarding the film two stars out of four and stating that \"the film is often absurd and never less than giddy with uplift, but that's not to say it's bad. I watched with an incredulous delight, and at the end, I liked Tom Shadyac quite a lot...he offers us this hopeful if somewhat undigested cut of his findings, in a film as watchable as a really good TV commercial, and just as deep.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nMaterialism (economic)\nMaterialism (physical)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nI Am at IMDb\nI Am at Rotten Tomatoes Liar, Liar is a 1993 Canadian drama television film starring Vanessa King as a girl who accuses her father (Art Hindle) of molestation, only to have no one in her family believe her. The film originally aired on January 24, 1993 on CBC Television in Canada.\nIt aired under the title Liar, Liar: Between Father and Daughter on CBS on June 22, 1993 in the United States. It was also released under the title Daddy's Little Secret in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n11-year-old Kelly Farrow (Vanessa King) is a girl with a history of telling tall tales and bullying her younger siblings.  One night, she locks her younger brother Patrick (Joel Palmer) in the bathroom, which terrifies him greatly, and is punished by her father Gil (Art Hindle), who supposedly \"spanks\" her.  Afterwards, Kelly vows that he will never hurt her again.  At school the next day, she hears a classmate tell a story about a relative who accused her father of molestation and had him sent to jail; this gives her an idea.  Kelly tells her teacher Mrs. Hildebrant (Wendy Van Riesen) that her father has been sexually abusing her. Kelly speaks with the authorities, and they arrange to have her father arrested.\nThe accusation and subsequent trial creates distance between Kelly and her family; mother Mary (Rosemary Dunsmore) and sisters Jean \"Nini\" (Ashleigh Aston Moore) and Christina \"Chrissy\" (Janne Mortil) doubt Kelly, given her history of lying and bullying.  The only family member who believes her is Patrick.  Gil's attorney Helen Browne (Susan Hogan) picks her case apart in court by confirming that Kelly is technically still a virgin (as her hymen has not been broken), and by casting doubt on the medical evidence of abuse.  People come to believe that Kelly is lying because her father is known to be strict in his punishments, including prosecutor Susan Miori (Kate Nelligan), and she struggles to get people to believe her.\nWhen older sister Chrissy tries to talk Kelly into dropping the case, Kelly confronts her with her knowledge of a secret that Chrissy herself has completely repressed her memories. Throughout her childhood and adolescence, Gil abused her, and switched his incestuous attentions to Kelly after Chrissy left home.  As they are talking, Patrick becomes hysterically frightened after being left alone in the bathroom with Chrissy's husband Keith (Roman Podhora).  Shell-shocked, Chrissy realizes that not only was Kelly telling the truth, but that Patrick has also suffered at the hands of their father, which is where his fear of being locked in the bathroom stems from.\nAfter confronting her father, Chrissy defends her sister by telling the court of her own abuse, which parallels Kelly's account.  The next day, Gil is convicted and sentenced to prison for 10 months and probation for 2 years.  The judge apologizes to Kelly, stating that age is not a factor in determining honesty.  He goes on to state that he wants a full investigation into Chrissy's allegations, and into Gil's relations with Nini and Patrick.  While Mary and Nini are shocked and devastated at the situation, Kelly walks out with Chrissy and Patrick, relieved that she was finally believed.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nArt Hindle as Gil Farrow\nVanessa King as Kelly Farrow\nJanne Mortil as Christina \"Chrissy\" Farrow-Berezuk\nRosemary Dunsmore as Mary Farrow\nAshleigh Aston Moore as Jean \"Nini\" Farrow\nJoel Palmer as Patrick Farrow\nKate Nelligan as Susan Miori\nRoman Podhora as Keith Berezuk\nMichelle St. John as Janice\nWendy Van Reisen as Mrs. Hildebrandt\nKaj-Erik Eriksen as Jonah\nSusan Hogan as Helen Browne\nSelina Hanuse as Female student\n\n\n== Reception ==\nLiar, Liar is known for its numerous Gemini Award nominations. The Los Angeles Times praised the film, with critic Ray Loynd noting that the film's candid flashbacks to traumatic childhood sexual abuse might be \"unnerving\", while also stating, \"a Canadian production (which premiered in Canada on the CBC last January), the movie is perhaps the most candid and most suspenseful parent/child molestation story aired to date on U.S. television.\" Tony Scott of Daily Variety was slightly more critical but still generally positive, stating, \"if the outcome's not entirely satisfactory, the telefilm has much to say about truth and buried anger.\"\n\n\n== Award nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLiar, Liar at IMDb\nLiar, Liar at the TCM Movie Database\nLiar, Liar at AllMovie\nReview by Ken Tucker at EW.com The Actors Studio is a membership organization for professional actors, theatre directors and playwrights located on West 44th Street in Hell's Kitchen, New York City. The studio is best known for its work refining and teaching method acting. It was founded in 1947 by Elia Kazan, Cheryl Crawford, and Robert Lewis, and later directed by Lee Strasberg, all former members of the Group Theatre, an early pioneer of the acting techniques of Constantin Stanislavsky that would become known as method acting. Notable actors and playwrights who have shared their work at the studio include Marilyn Monroe, Marlon Brando (who joined the studio in its first year), Lorraine Hansberry and James Baldwin. While at the Studio, actors work together to develop their skills in a private environment where they can take risks as performers without the pressure of commercial roles. As of July 2024, the studio's co-presidents are Ellen Burstyn, Alec Baldwin and Al Pacino. The co-artistic directors in New York are Martha Gehman and Javier Molina, and the associate artistic director in New York is Estelle Parsons. The co-artistic directors in Los Angeles are Katherine Cortez and Salome Jens.    History  After an initial meeting held on October 5, 1947, at the Labor Stage, located at 106 W. 39th Street (formerly the Princess Theatre), in which goals and ground rules of the new organization were discussed, the studio officially opened for business the following day. Elia Kazan, Cheryl Crawford, and Robert Lewis who founded the studio, had all been members of the Group Theatre, which had been an early adopter of method acting in the 1930s. Based on acting techniques first taught by Constantin Stanislavsky at the Moscow Art Theatre, Method acting or the “Method” was further refined at the Actor's Studio, including by Lee Strasberg, who had closely studied Stanislavski's theories at the Group Theater and who became director of the studio from 1952 until his death on February 17, 1982. Around 700 actors auditioned in the studio's first year, with 50 actors selected to become its first group of members, including Marlon Brando. Once actors pass the studio's audition process they become life-members who can attend sessions where members present work to each other. Some non-members are also invited to observe sessions, and on rare occasions non-members such as Marilyn Monroe have been invited to present. The studio has also provided opportunities for playwrights including Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Edward Albee and Tennessee Williams to develop new works.    Location  Before settling in its current location in 1955, the Studio moved regularly over an eight-year period. It first opened in October 1947 at the Union Methodist Episcopal Church, located at 229 West 48th Street, previously home to the Actors Kitchen and Lounge (maintained to assist actors and others unable to afford meals), and long a source of rental rehearsal space for local theatrical producers. In January 1948, it was a dance studio on East 59th Street. In April of that year, a move to the CBS Building at 1697 Broadway, near 53rd Street, established some semblance of stability; the Studio would not move again until the summer of 1952. From that point, the old Theatre Guild rehearsal rooms on the top floor of the ANTA Theatre became home, as they would remain until October 1954, when theatre renovations reduced the Studio to renting space twice a week. This it did at the Malin Studios at 1545 Broadway, Room 610. This arrangement continued throughout the 1954–1955 theatrical season, even as the Studio was acquiring and renovating its current venue. In 1955, it moved to its current location at 432 West 44th Street, a Greek Revival structure which was built for the Seventh Associate Presbyterian Church, in 1858 or 1859. It was one of the last churches to be built in that style in New York City.    Graduate drama school   From September 1994 through May 2005, the Studio collaborated with The New School in the education of master's-level theatre students at the Actors Studio Drama School (ASDS). After ending its contract with The New School, the Actors Studio established The Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University in 2006.

The Actors is a 2003 film written and directed by Conor McPherson and starring Dylan Moran and Michael Caine. In supporting roles are Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson and Lena Headey. \" The Actors\" is a contemporary comedy set in Dublin. It follows the exploits of two mediocre stage actors as they devise a plan to con a retired gangster out of £ 50,000. The gangster owes the money to a third party, whom he has never met. The actors take advantage of this fact by impersonating this' unidentified' third party, and claiming the debt as their own. To pull it off they enlist Moran's eerily intelligent nine- year- old niece, who restructures the plan each time something goes wrong. The two protagonists are acting in a version of Shakespeare's\" Richard III\" in which everyone dresses in Nazi uniform, a sly nod to Ian McKellen's production. The film is centred on the Olympia Theatre, and it is noteworthy for featuring the famous glass awning over the entrance which has since been destroyed in a traffic accident. The glass awning has since been rebuilt to its full former glory. == Cast ==\nMichael Caine as Anthony O'Malley\nDylan Moran as Tom Quirk\nLena Headey as Dolores\nAbigail Iversen as Mary\nAisling O'Sullivan as Rita\nBen Miller as Clive\nMichael Gambon as Barreller\nSimon Delaney as Ronnie\nAlvaro Lucchesi as Lesley\nMichael McElhatton as Jock\nMiranda Richardson as Mrs. Magnani\nAlison Doody as herself\nMarty Whelan as himself\nDeirdre O'Kane as Stage Manager\n\n\n== Reception ==\nEmpire gives the film 2/5, describing it as \"Based on an idea by Neil Jordan, The Actors had the potential to be gut-achingly funny.

Liar Liar is a 1997 American comedy film directed by Tom Shadyac and written by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur. It stars Jim Carrey as a lawyer who built his entire career on lying but finds himself cursed to speak only the truth for a single day, during which he struggles to maintain his career and to reconcile with his ex-wife and son whom he alienated with his pathological lying. The film is the second of three collaborations between Carrey and Shadyac—the first being Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and the third being Bruce Almighty—the second of three collaborations between Guay and Mazur—the others being The Little Rascals and Heartbreakers—and the first of three collaborations between Carrey and producer Brian Grazer, the other two being How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) and Fun with Dick and Jane (2005). The film was released to critical and commercial success, grossing $302.7 million against a budget of $45 million and earning positive reviews from critics and audiences, who particularly praised Carrey's performance. At the 55th Golden Globe Awards, he was nominated for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.    Plot  Fletcher Reede is a divorced lawyer living in Los Angeles, who loves spending time with his young son, Max. However, Fletcher also has a habit of giving precedence to his career, breaking promises to Max and his ex-wife, Audrey, and then lying about the reasons, which has made him a successful defense lawyer at his firm. After Fletcher misses Max's birthday party when senior partner Miranda lures him to get promoted by having sex in the office, Max makes a birthday wish for Fletcher to be unable to lie for one day, which immediately comes true. Fletcher soon discovers, through a series of embarrassing incidents, that he is unable to lie, mislead, or withhold the truth in any way. Fletcher's inability to lie alienates him from both Miranda and his secretary Greta, gets his car impounded when he confesses all of his traffic infractions and unpaid tickets to a policeman, and causes him an inability to bend the truth in court. Fletcher's newest client is Samantha Cole, a gold digger who wants a net sum from her soon-to-be ex-husband, Richard Cole. The main witness, Kenneth Falk, with whom Samantha has been cheating, is eager to lie in court to win, but Fletcher cannot suborn perjury. Meanwhile, Audrey is planning to move to Boston with her fiancé, Jerry, and decides to take Max with them to protect him from any future disappointments that Fletcher may cause him. Fletcher tries desperately to delay the case, even beating himself up in the bathroom, but is unable to lie his way into a continuance. Knowing that he cannot deny the proof of Samantha's adultery, he successfully disputes the validity of her prenuptial agreement after overhearing her reveal her actual age, discovering that she signed it as a minor without parental consent. This entitles Samantha to 50% of Richard's marital assets, allowing Fletcher to win the case truthfully. However, Samantha also insists on contesting custody of their children for an extra $10,000 in monthly child support payments. A disheartened Fletcher, realizing that he corrupted Samantha with his lies, watches as she pulls her crying children out of Richard's arms. Horrified, Fletcher demands that the decision be reversed, but the judge holds him in contempt. Fletcher calls Audrey to bail him out, but she informs him that their plane leaves for Boston that night. Greta learns of this and, having realized that Fletcher turned over a new leaf, pays his bail. Recognizing Max as his highest priority, Fletcher rushes to the airport, but Audrey and Max's plane has already left the gate. In desperation, he hijacks a mobile stairway to pursue the plane onto the runway. After throwing one of his shoes at the plane's windshield, he is able to get the plane to stop, but is injured after he crashes the mobile stairway and gets thrown off. On a stretcher, Fletcher vows to Max that he will spend more time with him. He says that despite the fact he is free to lie now that the 24 hours have elapsed, it feels better to be honest. Max believes him, and Audrey, encouraged by Jerry, decides to remain in California. One year later, Fletcher  and Audrey are celebrating Max's birthday. Max makes a birthday wish, only to find that Fletcher and Audrey are kissing when the lights come back on. Fletcher asks Max if he wished for them to get back together, but Max says he only wished for rollerblades. Steven Brent Oedekerk is an American filmmaker, actor, and stand-up comedian. He is best known for his collaborations with actor and comedian Jim Carrey and director Tom Shadyac (particularly the Ace Ventura franchise), his series of \"Thumbmation\" shorts and his film Kung Pow! Enter the Fist (2002), along with his films Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, Santa vs. the Snowman 3D, Barnyard, and The Nutty Professor remake.    Early life  Oedekerk was born in Seattle, Washington; he was raised by his mother Rena Borlandeli and father Martin Oedekerk in Huntington Beach, California. He attended Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California and Golden West College in Huntington Beach. He is of Dutch Frisian, Irish, Hungarian and Italian (Lombard) descent. His mother is an emigrant from Magnago, Italy. His paternal grandfather was an Afrikaner born in South Africa to Dutch parents.    Career  Throughout his career, Oedekerk has appeared in and created several television specials for NBC, ABC, and UPN. He also contributed his writing talents to FOX during the late 1980s  and through the early 1990s. It was during this time that Oedekerk befriended fellow comic/actor Jim Carrey while working on the television series In Living Color during its 1990–1994 run; this was the first of numerous collaborations between the two. Prior to his successful contributions to several unknown episodes in the Color TV series, he wrote and starred in his first independent/directorial film, Smart Alex (1987). It wasn't until 1991 that Oedekerk was attached not only as a writer, but also as the protagonist, as Thane Furrows in the film High Strung. Jim Carrey also starred opposite him in the role of Death, although he went uncredited. They eventually developed a strong friendship, which still exists today. Shortly afterward, Oedekerk again worked alongside Carrey as the project consultant for Tom Shadyac's first film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994). The film became a break-out success and he was given the opportunity to both direct and write its sequel, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995). This time Oedekerk directed and wrote the movie after Shadyac left before filming. The sequel proved to be more successful, surpassing the box office gross of the original. Despite this, both Oedekerk and Carrey wanted to pursue other projects, but still remained friends. Following the Ace Ventura franchise, Oedekerk co-wrote The Nutty Professor (1996), which was also directed by Shadyac for Universal Pictures; it became one of the highest-grossing films of that year.  He soon wrote, directed and also had a cameo appearance in Nothing to Lose (1997), starring Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence. Oedekerk took a hiatus from directing major film productions for the rest of the 1990s, but continued to write screenplays, including Patch Adams (1998), Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (2000), Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (2001), Kung Pow! Enter the Fist (2002) (which he directed, wrote and starred in), Bruce Almighty (2003) and Barnyard (2006) (which he directed, wrote, produced, and voiced various characters). In 2003, he signed a first look deal with Universal. In 2007, Oedekerk produced the screenplay and story for the Bruce Almighty sequel, Evan Almighty; again, Shadyac directed both films. He has also been commissioned to write the screenplay for the Ripley's Believe It or Not! film adaptation; Jim Carrey has since been cast in the title role. No news involving the project has been reported since. In February 2009, Universal Pictures announced that Steve Oedekerk would be penning a film adaptation of the Stretch Armstrong superhero doll. As of 2016, the film is left in development hell with an animated series currently in the works. In 2015, it was announced that a sequel to Kung Pow is currently in the works with him returning to write and direct.    O Entertainment   O Entertainment was a production company founded by Steve Oedekerk in 1990. O Entertainment's productions include the Thumbmation series (Thumb Wars, Bat Thumb, Thumbtanic, etc.), Santa vs. the Snowman 3D, Jimmy Neutron: The Boy Genius, The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius, Back at the Barnyard, Planet Sheen, and the movie The Super Mouse. Bruce Almighty is a 2003 American fantasy comedy film directed by Tom Shadyac and written by Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk. The film stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck television reporter who complains to God (played by Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week. It co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Philip Baker Hall, and Tony Bennett. The film is Shadyac and Carrey's third collaboration, after Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994) and Liar Liar (1997).  When released in American theaters on May 23, 2003, Bruce Almighty received mixed reviews from critics, and was a box-office success and grossed $86.4 million in its opening weekend, a Memorial Day record at the time. The film surprised the industry's pundits when it beat The Matrix Reloaded the following weekend. It went on to gross $484 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2003. Evan Almighty—a spin-off sequel focusing on Steve Carell's character, with Shadyac and Oedekerk returning to direct and write, respectively, and Freeman also reprising his role—was released on June 22, 2007.    Plot  Bruce Nolan is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News on WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman. When Bruce is insulted by his rival, Evan Baxter, a vulgar on-camera outburst leads to his dismissal from the station. After a series of misfortunes, Bruce complains to God that \"He's the one that should be fired\". Bruce receives a message on his pager, which takes him to an empty warehouse where he meets God. God offers to give Bruce his powers to prove that he is doing the job correctly. God tells Bruce that he cannot tell others he has God's powers to avoid the media attention, nor can he use the powers to alter free will. Bruce is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gains, such as regaining his previous job and impressing his girlfriend, Grace Connelly. Bruce finds ways of using his powers around Buffalo to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body during a segment on police training, or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him the nickname \"Mr. Exclusive\". Bruce then causes Evan to embarrass himself on-air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor. Bruce continues to hear voices in his head and re-encounters God, who explains the voices are prayers that Bruce must deal with. Bruce creates a computerized email-like system to receive the prayers and respond but finds that the influx is far too many for him to handle (despite only receiving prayers from the Buffalo area) and sets the program to answer every prayer Yes automatically. Bruce attends a party celebrating his promotion. When Grace arrives, she finds Bruce kissing his co-anchor, Susan Ortega, after she forcefully comes on to him, and quickly leaves. Bruce follows her, trying to use his powers to convince her to stay but cannot influence her free will. As Bruce looks around, he realizes that Buffalo has fallen into chaos due to his actions: parts of the city believe the Apocalypse is nearly upon Earth due to the meteor strikes, while a large number of people, all having prayed to win the multi-million dollar lottery and received only seventeen dollars in return, have started rioting in the streets. Bruce returns to God, who explains that he cannot solve all the problems and Bruce must figure out a way himself. Bruce then starts to help others without using his powers, including giving Evan his job back. He returns to his computer at home and goes about answering prayers earnestly. As he reads through them, he finds a prayer from Grace, wishing for his success and well-being. As Bruce reads it, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with him anymore. Stunned by this development, Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back his powers and leaving his fate in His hands. Bruce is suddenly hit by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void. God appears, and He asks Bruce what he really wants; Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that would make her happy. God agrees, and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, where his doctors help him recover. Grace finally arrives at the hospital and reconciles with Bruce.

Early life  Shadyac was born in Falls Church, Virginia to Julie and Richard Shadyac, a lawyer. His mother was of Lebanese descent, while his father was of half-Irish and half-Lebanese ancestry. His mother, who died of cancer in 1998, had become semi-quadriplegic and spent much of Shadyac's adult life in a wheelchair. Shadyac attended J. E. B. Stuart High School in Falls Church, where he had played basketball, participated in the Key Club, and made the Junior National and National Honor Societies. In both 1975 and 1976, Shadyac was included in the now-defunct \"Who's Who Among High School Students\" book, prior to his graduation in 1976. As a pre-law student at the University of Virginia, Shadyac produced a poster entitled \"Are You a Preppie?\" Borrowing from the style of National Lampoon magazine, and based on the large number of preppies in Charlottesville and nearby Richmond, Virginia, the poster preceded the more well-known The Official Preppy Handbook. The poster went into multiple printings and served as a fundraiser for his fraternity, Sigma Chi. Shadyac graduated from UVA in 1981, and later received his master's degree in film from the UCLA Film School in 1989, after completing the critically acclaimed short film Tom, Dick and Harry.    Career     Filmmaking  Shadyac moved to Los Angeles in 1983 and, at age 24, was Bob Hope's staff joke writer.

Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was Shadyac's first major film and featured an up-and-coming Jim Carrey, described by Shadyac as \"the only white guy in Living Color.\" Following Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Shadyac attained a prominent status in Hollywood and received frequent offers from significant figures in the comedy industry, keen to collaborate with him. He frequently cast Carrey in lead roles and his hit films with Carrey include Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar. Examples of other Shadyac films include his collaboration with Eddie Murphy on The Nutty Professor movie series; Patch Adams, starring Robin Williams; Dragonfly with Kevin Costner; and Evan Almighty, the sequel to Bruce Almighty with Steve Carell.

In his 2011 documentary I Am, which follows Shadyac in the aftermath of a bicycle accident in which he suffered significant injuries, he interviews scientists, religious leaders, environmentalists and philosophers, including David Suzuki, Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Lynne McTaggart, Elisabet Sahtouris, Howard Zinn and Thom Hartmann. The film asks two central questions: What’s Wrong With the World? and What Can We Do About it? The film is about \"human connectedness, happiness, and the human spirit,\" and explores Shadyac's personal journey, \"the nature of humanity\" and the \"world's ever-growing addiction to materialism.\" The film received a 23-minute standing ovation at its premiere screening.    Author  In 2013 Shadyac published a book entitled Life's Operating Manual and appeared on HBO's live broadcast show Real Time with Bill Maher as part of the promotional campaign. The book was published by Hay House on April 30, 2013 and in his review for the New York Journal of Books, Martin A.

Evan Almighty is a 2007 American fantasy comedy film that is a spin-off and sequel of Bruce Almighty (2003). The film was directed by Tom Shadyac, written by Steve Oedekerk, based on the characters created by Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe from the original film. It stars Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman reprising their roles as Evan Baxter and God, respectively, with new cast members Lauren Graham and John Goodman. The film is a modern-day retelling of Noah's Ark, which Evan reluctantly re-enacts because God commands him to do so at the same time Evan pursues a new career in government. Production of the film began in January 2006. Several visual effect companies were used to provide CGI for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the most expensive comedy film ever, later being overtaken by Men in Black 3. The film opened on June 22, 2007, and was a box-office bomb, grossing $174.4 million worldwide, and received generally negative reviews from critics.    Plot  Newly elected to Congress, former local television news reporter Evan Baxter leaves his hometown of Buffalo, New York and moves with his family to the community of Prestige Crest, located in the fictional town of Huntsville, Virginia, where his congressional campaign officially declares that he will change the world. Evan prays to God to give him this opportunity. His wife, Joan, also prays that she, Evan, and their three sons will be closer together as a family. On his first day in Congress, Evan receives a letter from a greedy colleague, Congressman Chuck Long, who provides him with a prime office and gives him the opportunity to join him as the junior co-sponsor to his Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act (CINPLAN) bill. Over the next several days, strange events in Evan's life occur:  Eight vacant lots in Prestige Crest are purchased under his name and ancient tools and gopher wood are delivered there Pairs of animals start following him around everywhere he goes, with birds flying into his office through the window He begins to grow a beard, which grows back whenever he shaves it every morning His hair grows uncontrollably His clothes are replaced with robes The number 614 starts appearing in various forms throughout his daily routines Evan comes to realize that the number actually refers to verse 14 in chapter 6 of the Book of Genesis, where God instructed Noah to build an ark in preparation for a coming flood. Although Evan initially rejects this idea, God himself starts appearing to Evan and assures him that the flood will come and the only way he can change the world will be through recreating the ark instead. Evan finally decides to start building it using the tools and materials provided, giving him an opportunity to spend more time with his sons, but Joan sees this as a midlife crisis. While Evan still maintains his career in Congress, his appearance alienates his staffers and the animals that follow him everywhere become more disruptive. God reappears to Evan and provides him a robe, later warning him the flood will come mid-day on the 22nd of September. When God indefinitely exposes Evan's robe, Long gets him suspended from Congress and have him removed from the Public Land Act bill. Believing that Evan has gone insane, Joan leaves him behind, causing Evan himself to continue building the ark alone. Meanwhile, God disguises himself as a waiter in a restaurant and speaks with Joan. God assures Joan that she should see this as an opportunity for the entire family to get closer to each other. Joan is inspired and finally returns to help Evan finish building the ark together to prepare for the flood. On September 22, Evan's three staffers show him evidence that Long had planned to build Prestige Crest after damming off a nearby water source, but Long had cut many corners in building the dam. They suspect Long would do the same with the Public Land Act Bill. With the ark finally complete, the animals board two by two. However, the local police threaten to demolish it with a wrecking ball as the ark violates land codes and a small amount of rain falls. Evan realizes that the flood will not be due to the rain, but as a result of Long's dam failing. The dam eventually fails, destroying all the homes of Prestige Crest. The entire community manages to safely board the Ark, which rides the floodwaters to Washington, D.C.. The ark then comes to its final destination in front of the Capitol, interrupting the vote for Long's Public Land Act Bill. The flood results in Evan criticizing Long of being responsible for cost-cutting leading up to the dam's failure. The voting of the Public Land Act Bill is suspended due to an investigation on Long for profiteering. After the flood, Evan is reinstated to Congress and all the animals return to their natural habitats.

He is considered one of the best contemporary Irish playwrights; his plays have attracted good reviews, and have been performed internationally (notably in the West End and on Broadway).    Career  The Weir opened at the Royal Court before transferring to the West End and Broadway. It won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play for 1999. In the same year he was one of the recipients of the V Europe Prize Theatrical Realities awarded to the Royal Court Theatre (with Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Jez Butterworth, Martin McDonagh). His 2001 play, Port Authority tells of three interwoven lives. The play was first produced by the Gate Theatre of Dublin but premiered at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London in February 2001, before moving to the Gate Theatre in April of that year. The production was directed by McPherson himself. New York's Atlantic Theater Company staged a production of the play in spring of 2008, starring Brian d'Arcy James, and Tony Award winners John Gallagher Jr. and Jim Norton. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley said, \"I found myself holding on to what these actors had to say as if I were a five-year-old at bedtime being introduced to The Arabian Nights.\" McPherson also directed his play, Dublin Carol, at the Atlantic Theater Company, New York, in 2003. His 2004 play Shining City opened at the Royal Court and prompted The Daily Telegraph to describe him as \"the finest dramatist of his generation\". A meditation on regret, guilt and confusion, the play is set entirely within the Dublin offices of a psychiatrist who himself has psychological secrets. Whilst much of the play takes the form of monologues delivered by a patient, the everyday stories and subtle poignancy and humour make it a riveting experience. It subsequently opened on Broadway in 2006 and was nominated for two Tony Awards, including Best Play. In September 2006, to great critical acclaim, McPherson made his National Theatre debut as both author and director with The Seafarer at the Cottesloe auditorium, starring Karl Johnson and Jim Norton, with Ron Cook as their poker-playing, Mephistophelean guest. Norton won an Olivier Award for his performance while McPherson was nominated for both the Olivier and Evening Standard Awards for Best Play. In October 2007 The Seafarer opened on Broadway, keeping with it most of its creative team, including McPherson as director and both Jim Norton and Conleth Hill in their respective roles, with David Morse taking over as Sharky, and Ciarán Hinds portraying Mr. Lockhart. The production on Broadway received some positive reviews including such statements as \"McPherson is quite possibly the finest playwright of his generation\" from Ben Brantley at The New York Times and \"Succinct, startling and eerie, and the funniest McPherson play to date\" from The Observer. Norton's performance as Richard Harkin in The Seafarer at the National Theatre won the 2007 Best Supporting Actor Laurence Olivier Award, and he won a Tony Award in 2008 for Best Featured Actor in a play. McPherson wrote and directed a stage adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's story The Birds, which opened in September 2009 at the Gate Theatre in Dublin. In 2011 the National Theatre London premiered his play The Veil at the Lyttleton. Described by The Times as \"a cracking fireside tale of haunting and decay\" it is set in 1822 and marked McPherson's first foray into period drama. This vein continued with a striking new translation of August Strindberg's The Dance of Death premiered at the Trafalgar Studios in London at the end of 2012. His version was described as \"a profoundly seminal work\" by The Guardian which also managed, The Times said, to be \"Shockingly funny\". The Donmar Warehouse mounted a season of McPherson's work in 2013 with a revival of The Weir and the world premiere of The Night Alive. Jim Norton (born 4 January 1938) is an Irish stage, film and television character actor, known for his work in the theatre, most notably in Conor McPherson's The Seafarer, and on television as Bishop Brennan in the sitcom Father Ted.    Early life  Jim Norton was born on 4 January 1938 in Dublin, Ireland, and educated at Synge Street CBS. From an early age he wanted to be an actor, and regularly attended performances at the Abbey Theatre. His mother, Frances, played the violin and his father, Eugene, was a baritone singer. Eugene worked as a bakery manager. Jim had one sibling, the late acting teacher Betty Ann Norton.    Career  Norton has been acting for over forty years in theatre, television, and film, and frequently plays clergymen, most notably Bishop Brennan in the sitcom Father Ted, as well as roles in The Sweeney (1975), Peak Practice (1993), Sunset Heights (1997), A Love Divided (1999), Rebus: Black and Blue (2000), Mad About Mambo (2000), Boxed (2003) and Jimmy's Hall (2014). Norton starred as Finian McLonergan in the critically acclaimed New York City Center's 2009 production of Finian's Rainbow, and in October 2009 reprised the role in the Broadway revival at the St. James Theatre. His co-stars were Cheyenne Jackson (Woody) and Kate Baldwin (Sharon).    Television  As well as Bishop Brennan in Father Ted, Norton also played: Albert Einstein in two episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation (namely \"The Nth Degree\" and \"Descent\"); the librarian Lieutenant James Porteous in the highly acclaimed 1970s British television drama series Colditz; Phil Harrister, a criminal involved in an intricate bank robbery, in The Sweeney episode \"Contact Breaker\"; O'Brady in the Minder  episode \"National Pelmet\"; and Rory, a roguish but genteel Irishman who is diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, in The Royal episode \"Beggars and Choosers\". Norton has appeared in two episodes of Van der Valk.  On Babylon 5 he appeared in a number of roles, including that of Ombuds Wellington in the 1994 episodes \"Grail\" and \"The Quality of Mercy\"; a Narn in \"Dust to Dust\" (1996); and Dr. Lazarenn, a Markab doctor, in \"Confessions and Lamentations\" (1995). In Fall of Eagles he played Alexander Kerensky. Other television work includes: 1990, Agatha Christie's Poirot; Waking the Dead; Cheers; Frasier; Midsomer Murders; Maigret and Rumpole of the Bailey as Fig Newton, Stan Laurel in the BBC drama Stan (2006) and Larry Joyce in the 2013 television drama Deception, Silas Mitton, Brendan Robinson and Digger in the stop motion series The Treacle People (1996-1997) and as the timid Gardener in the first series of the long-running CITV children's series T-Bag: \"Wonders in Letterland\" (1985)    Films  1960s Norton made his film debut with a small role in the 1965 thriller The Face of Fu Manchu starring Christopher Lee, and later appeared in the 1969 epic film Alfred the Great as Thanet. 1970s Norton played the part of Pongo in the screen version of Spike Milligan's war-time memoir Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall. In 1971 he played Chris Cawsey (aka \"The Rat Man\"), one of several villains in the controversial Sam Peckinpah film Straw Dogs starring Dustin Hoffman. His character had a deviously infectious, deliberately irritating laugh that helped build tension throughout the film. 1990s Norton appeared in the movie Memoirs of an Invisible Man alongside Chevy Chase in 1992. In the same year he also appeared in the Irish-made film Into the West. 2000s Norton appeared in the comedy On the Nose as Patrick Cassidy, along with Dan Aykroyd and Robbie Coltrane, in 2001. He appeared in a cameo in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets in 2002 as Mr. Mason. He played an Irish immigrant in the 2005 Australian/UK co-production, The Oyster Farmer. He played title role of Stan Laurel in the 2006 TV movie Stan, based on Neil Brand's radio play of the same name.

Manga  A manga adaptation with art by Funa Yukina has been serialized in Media Factory's seinen manga magazine Monthly Comic Alive since August 2019. It has been collected in four tankōbon volumes.    Anime  An anime adaptation was announced on April 1, 2021, which is April Fool's Day. An actor or actress is a person who portrays a character in a production. The actor performs \"in the flesh\" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally \"one who answers\". The actor's interpretation of a role—the art of acting—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. This can also be considered an \"actor's role\", which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \"playing themselves\", as in some forms of experimental performance art. Formerly, in ancient Greece and the medieval world, and in England at the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys. While Ancient Rome did allow female stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking parts. The commedia dell'arte of Italy, however, allowed professional women to perform early on; Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first well-documented actresses in Italy (and in Europe). After the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear onstage in England. In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.    History  The first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC (though the changes in the calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the Greek performer Thespis stepped onto the stage at the Theatre Dionysus to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Before Thespis' act, Grecian stories were only expressed in song, dance, and in third person narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called Thespians. The exclusively male actors in the theatre of ancient Greece performed in three types of drama: tragedy, comedy, and the satyr play. This developed and expanded considerably under the Romans. The theatre of ancient Rome was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of situation comedies, to high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies. As the Western Roman Empire fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power was moved eastward to Constantinople. Records show that mime, pantomime, scenes or recitations from tragedies and comedies, dances, and other entertainments were very popular. From the 5th century, Western Europe was plunged into a period of general disorder. Small nomadic bands of actors traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience; there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes. Traditionally, actors were not of high status; therefore, in the Early Middle Ages, traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. Early Middle Ages actors were denounced by the Church during the Dark Ages, as they were viewed as dangerous, immoral, and pagan. In many parts of Europe, traditional beliefs of the region and time meant actors could not receive a Christian burial. In the Early Middle Ages, churches in Europe began staging dramatized versions of biblical events. By the middle of the 11th century, liturgical drama had spread from Russia to Scandinavia to Italy. The Feast of Fools encouraged the development of comedy. In the Late Middle Ages, plays were produced in 127 towns. These vernacular Mystery plays often contained comedy, with actors playing devils, villains, and clowns. The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. Amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers. There were several secular plays staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is The Play of the Greenwood by Adam de la Halle in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences. Farces also rose in popularity after the 13th century. At the end of the Late Middle Ages, professional actors began to appear in England and Europe. Richard III and Henry VII both maintained small companies of professional actors. Beginning in the mid-16th century, Commedia dell'arte troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. Commedia dell'arte was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays were loose frameworks that provided situations, complications, and the outcome of the action, around which the actors improvised. The plays used stock characters. A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

He was the third child of Henry\" Light Horse Harry\" Lee and Anne Hill Carter Lee, and the older brother of Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Lee and Herring were a British standup comedy double act consisting of the comedians Stewart Lee and Richard Herring. They were most famous for their work on television, most notably\" Fist of Fun\" and\" This Morning with Richard Not Judy\" but had been working together on stage and on radio since the late 1980s. As with many double acts, Lee and Herring performed as contrasting personalities: one mature and duplicitous( Lee) and the other puerile and cheeky( Herring). As with several other double acts, Lee and Herring had a certain irony to their style and constantly checked themselves and made reference to this. The characters of Lee and Herring were parodies and exaggerations of their real life selves. In 2011, Frank Skinner cited Lee and Herring as one of his favourite comedy double acts, alongside Laurel and Hardy, The Two Ronnies and Reeves and Mortimer. Lee J. Cobb (born Leo Jacoby; December 8, 1911 – February 11, 1976) was an American actor, known both for film roles and his work on the Broadway stage, as well as for his television role in the series, The Virginian. He often played arrogant, intimidating and abrasive characters, but he also acted as respectable figures such as judges and police officers. Cobb originated the role of Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's 1949 play Death of a Salesman under the direction of Elia Kazan, and was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for On the Waterfront (1954) and The Brothers Karamazov (1958).  His film performances included Juror #3 in 12 Angry Men (1957), Dock Tobin in Man of the West (1958), Barak Ben Canaan in Exodus (1960), Marshall Lou Ramsey in How the West Was Won (1962), Cramden in Our Man Flint (1966), and Lt. William Kinderman in The Exorcist (1973). On television, Cobb played a leading role in the first four seasons of the Western series, The Virginian as Judge Henry Garth and the ABC legal drama The Young Lawyers as David Barrett, and was nominated for an Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor Primetime Emmy Award three times. In 1981, Cobb was posthumously inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.    Early life and education  Cobb was born in New York City, to a Jewish family of Russian and Romanian origin. He grew up in The Bronx, New York, on Wilkins Avenue, near Crotona Park. His parents were Benjamin (Benzion) Jacob, a compositor for a foreign-language newspaper, and Kate (Neilecht). Interested in acting from a young age, Cobb ran away from home at 16 to try to make it in Hollywood. He joined Borrah Minevitch's Harmonica Rascals as a musician and had a bit part in a short film featuring the group, but failed to find steady work and eventually moved back to New York. Cobb studied accounting at New York University while working as a radio salesman. Still interested in show business, he went back to California and studied acting at the Pasadena Playhouse. He finally made his film debut at 23 in two episodes of the film serial The Vanishing Shadow (1934). He joined the Manhattan-based Group Theatre in 1935.    Career     Stage  Cobb performed summer stock with the Group Theatre in 1936, when it summered at Pine Brook Country Club in Nichols, Connecticut. He made his Broadway debut as a saloonkeeper in a dramatization of Crime and Punishment that closed after 15 nights. He starred opposite Elia Kazan in Group Theatre's productions of Clifford Odets' Waiting for Lefty and Golden Boy. He also acted in Ernest Hemingway's only ever full-length play, The Fifth Column, and Odets' Clash by Night. Cobb gained widespread recognition for his portrayal of Willy Loman in the original production of Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman under the direction of Elia Kazan. Miller praised Cobb as \"the greatest dramatic actor I ever saw\" and, upon his casting, changed a line referring to the physical appearance of the title character, whom the author had originally conceived of as a small man, from \"shrimp\" to \"walrus\". Cobb played through the play's entire initial run at the Morosco Theatre between February 1949 and November 1950. The play won the Tony Award for Best Play and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Miller later offered Cobb the part of Eddie Carbone in A View from the Bridge, but Cobb turned it down. During World War II, Cobb joined the US Army Air Forces in the hopes of becoming a pilot. Instead, he was assigned to a radio unit. He was later transferred to the First Motion Picture Unit, where he appeared in Moss Hart Army Emergency Relief fundraiser productions like This is the Army and Winged Victory. In 1968, his performance as King Lear with Stacy Keach as Edmund, René Auberjonois as the Fool, and Philip Bosco as Kent achieved the longest run (72 performances) for the play in Broadway history.    Film   Cobb entered films in the 1930s, successfully playing middle-aged and even older characters while he was still a youth. His first credited role was in the 1937 Hopalong Cassidy oater Rustlers' Valley, where he was billed using the stage name 'Lee Colt.' In all subsequent films, he used Lee Cobb and later Lee J. Bruce Lee (born Lee Jun-fan; November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong-American martial artist and actor. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines. Credited with helping popularize martial arts films in the 1970s, Lee is considered by some commentators and martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and West. He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to change the way Chinese people were presented in American films. Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor by his father. His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Ip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and frequent street fighting (neighborhood and rooftop fights). In 1959, Lee moved to Seattle, where he enrolled at the University of Washington in 1961. It was during this time in the United States that he began considering making money by teaching martial arts, even though he aspired to have a career in acting. He opened his first martial arts school, operated out of home in Seattle. After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, he once drew significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of California by making demonstrations and speaking. He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to teach, where his students included Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In the 1970s, his Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated Hong Kong martial arts films to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of Western interest in Chinese martial arts. The direction and tone of his films dramatically influenced and changed martial arts and martial arts films worldwide. With a career spanning Hong Kong and the United States, he is known for his roles in five feature-length Hong Kong martial arts films in the early 1970s: Lo Wei's The Big Boss (1971) and Fist of Fury (1972); Golden Harvest's The Way of the Dragon (1972), directed and written by Lee; and Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers' Enter the Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978), both directed by Robert Clouse. After Lee's death, his films gained a large cult following. He became an iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, based upon his portrayal of Cantonese culture in his films, and among Asian Americans for defying Asian stereotypes in the United States. Having initially learned Wing Chun, tai chi, boxing, and street fighting, he combined them with other influences from various sources into the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy, which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist). Lee died in July 1973, aged 32. Since his death, Lee has continued to be a prominent influence on modern combat sports, including judo, karate, mixed martial arts, and boxing, as well as modern popular culture, including film, television, comics, animation, and video games. Time named Lee one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century.    Early life   Bruce Lee's birth name was Lee Jun-fan. His father, Lee Hoi-chuen, was a Cantonese opera singer based in Hong Kong. His mother Grace Ho was born in Shanghai, and she was of Eurasian ancestry. In December 1939, his parents traveled to California for an international opera tour in Chinatown, San Francisco. He was born there on November 27, 1940, allowing him to claim U.S. citizenship due to the United States' jus soli citizenship laws. When he was four months old (April 1941), the Lee family returned to Hong Kong. Soon after, the Lee family experienced unexpected hardships over the next four years as Japan, amid World War II, launched a surprise attack on Hong Kong in December 1941 and ruled the city for the next four years. Lee's maternal grandfather was Cantonese, his maternal grandmother was English, and his maternal great-uncle, Robert Hotung, was a Hong Kong businessman of Dutch Jewish and Cantonese descent.    Career and education     1940–1958: Early roles, schooling and martial arts initiation  Lee's father Lee Hoi-chuen was a Cantonese opera star. As a result, Junior Lee was introduced to the world of cinema at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film Golden Gate Girl. He took his Chinese stage name as 李小龍, lit. The Sacramento Kings are an American professional basketball team based in Sacramento, California. The Kings compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Kings are the oldest team in the NBA, and the first team in the major professional North American sports leagues located in Sacramento. The team plays its home games at the Golden 1 Center. Their best seasons to date in the city were in the early 2000s, including a very successful 2001–02 season when they had the best record in the NBA at 61–21 (a winning percentage of .744). The franchise began with the Rochester Seagrams (a semi-professional team) from Rochester, New York, that formed in 1923 and hosted a number of teams there over the next 20 years. They joined the National Basketball League in 1945 as the renamed Rochester Royals, winning that league's championship in their first season, 1945–46. In 1948 they jumped with three other NBL teams to the Basketball Association of America, that later merged with the NBL to form the NBA. As the Royals, the team was often successful on the court, winning the NBA championship in 1951. The team, however, found it increasingly difficult to turn a profit in the comparatively small market of Rochester and relocated to Cincinnati in 1957, becoming the Cincinnati Royals. In 1972, the team relocated again, this time to Kansas City, Missouri, and renamed the Kansas City–Omaha Kings because it initially split its home games between Kansas City and Omaha, Nebraska; the nickname was changed to avoid confusion with the baseball team dubbed the Kansas City Royals. After three seasons, the team truncated to Kansas City Kings, but continued to play several home games per season in Omaha, through March 1978. The franchise again failed to find success in its market and moved after the 1984–85 season to Sacramento. Between 2006 and 2022, the Kings had 16 consecutive losing seasons, the most in NBA history. The Kings also had the longest active postseason drought in the four major North American sports, which started in 2006 and lasted until 2023.    Franchise history     1923–1944: Rochester Seagrams  The basis of a purely-professional team in Rochester, New York, which came into existence in 1945, was two decades of a sponsored semi-professional team, the Rochester Seagrams. Canadian distiller Seagram was the team's main sponsor and received the bulk of what monies were made. One of the team's early stars was Lester Harrison, a local high school star of some publicity before joining the team. Harrison later became the team's captain, coach, manager, and chief scout over the next two decades. Among visitors to Rochester to play the team were the Original Celtics, the New York Rens, and the Harlem Globetrotters.    1945–1957: Rochester Royals   With news that World War II was approaching its end, the National Basketball League (NBL) announced that it was expanding, and Harrison was approached for interest in a franchise. While the sponsored semi-professional team balked at additional expenses involved, Harrison and his brother Jack, a lawyer, jumped at the chance. They pooled money to meet the steep entry fee of $25,000 ($423,105 in 2023) and were granted an NBL franchise. Their team, the Rochester Royals, pushed the Seagrams out of their local facility, smallish Edgerton Park Arena. The best players were the returning Navy and Army players now being released from the war. There was no draft for the league in the selection of new players. So, Harrison was able to scoop up several name stars for his new team, among them Bob Davies, Red Holzman and William \"Fuzzy\" Levane, as well as NBL free agents like George Glamack and Al Cervi. The result was a strong league champion in their first season of existence as the Royals during the 1945–46 season. The team had two more seasons of success during their NBL years, which permitted the team to play non-league opponents. During all three years, 1945–1948, the team played over 300 total games, hosting most of them. The Royals defected to the NBL's rival, the Basketball Association of America (BAA), in 1948 along with the Fort Wayne Pistons, Minneapolis Lakers, and Indianapolis (Kautskys) Jets. A year later, the BAA and the NBL merged to become the National Basketball Association (NBA). The move to the BAA took away Rochester's profitable exhibition schedule and placed it in the same Western Division as the Minneapolis Lakers. Of the two best teams in professional basketball, only one of them could play in the league finals from 1949 to 1954. Phil Ryan( 21 October 1946 – 30 April 2016) was a Welsh keyboardist and composer, best known for his work with Man and Pete Brown. Euna Lee( Hangul: 리유나)( born 1972) is a Korean American journalist who has worked for Current TV since 2005. Lee and fellow journalist Laura Ling were detained in North Korea after they crossed into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the People's Republic of China without a visa. They were found guilty of illegal entry and sentenced to twelve years' hard labor in June 2009. The United States Government protested the sentences, and implemented diplomatic efforts in order to secure the release of both Lee and Ling. On 4 August 2009 Lee and Ling were pardoned by the North Korean government after a special humanitarian visit by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Lee was born and raised in South Korea, and moved to the United States in order to attend Academy of Art University, where she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Film and Broadcasting. She graduated from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 2012. She is married to actor Michael Saldate; they have a daughter, Hana. On 4 August 2009, former US President Bill Clinton visited North Korea in an attempt to free Lee and fellow journalist Laura Ling. The North Korean government pardoned both Lee and Ling after meeting with Clinton that day. Human rights activists in South Korea accused Lee and Ling of placing North Korean refugees in danger through their actions. In 2011, Lee and Ling received the McGill Medal for Journalistic Courage from the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. John Lee Thompson (1 August 1914 – 30 August 2002) was an English film director, screenwriter and producer. Initially an exponent of social realism, he became known as a versatile and prolific director of thrillers, action, and adventure films. His works included mainstream critical and commercial successes like Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957), Ice Cold in Alex (1958), Tiger Bay (1959), North West Frontier (also 1959), The Guns of Navarone (1961), the original Cape Fear (1962), and Mackenna's Gold (1969). He also directed cult classics like the Planet of the Apes sequels, The White Buffalo (1977), Happy Birthday to Me (1981), King Solomon's Mines (1985) and several Charles Bronson vehicles for Cannon Films in the 1980's.  Thompson received an Academy Award nomination for an Best Director for The Guns of Navarone. He was also a four-time BAFTA Award nominee (twice for Best Film and twice for Outstanding British Film). He also received accolades from the Berlin International Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival, and was both a Golden Globe and Directors Guild of America Award nominee.    Early life  Thompson was born in the Bristol suburb of Westbury on Trym on 1 August 1914.  His family had links to the theatre. Thompson studied at Dover College then went to work in the theatre, joining the Nottingham Repertory Company as an actor and stagehand. He later went to work for a repertory company in Croydon, Surrey. He wrote plays in his spare time, and had started when he was nine. One of them, Murder Happens? was performed at Croydon in 1934. His second staged play, Double Error, had a brief West End run at the Fortune Theatre in 1935. An article from this time about the play said he had written 40 plays already, including four in between his first two staged plays. A company worth £10,000 was formed to exploit Thompson's writings over the next seven years but this appears to have not had a long life. Thompson later said he had written a part for himself to perform, but when management asked him if he wanted to do so he said \"of course not,\" and \"the die was cast. Later I decided if I didn't have the guts to admit I wanted to play the role I should never act again and I never did.\"    Screenwriter  The film rights to Double Error were purchased for £100. Thompson was hired to work in the scriptwriting department at British International Pictures at Elstree Studios. While there he made his one appearance as an actor in films, playing a small role in Midshipman Easy (1935). His first credit was The Price of Folly (1937), based on his play. He also worked on the scripts for Glamorous Night (1937), and he worked as dialogue coach on Jamaica Inn (1939), directed by Alfred Hitchcock. He wrote the scripts for The Middle Watch (1940), made at Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) and East of Piccadilly (1941).    World War II  Thompson served in World War II as a tailgunner and wireless operator in the RAF. In 1942 a revised version of Double Error, titled Murder Without Crime, opened at the Comedy Theatre in London. The play had a run on Broadway in 1943.    Post War  After the war Thompson returned to his work as scriptwriter under contract at Associated British on such films as No Place for Jennifer (1949) and For Them That Trespass (1949), the latter starring Richard Todd in his debut. Thompson was dialogue director on The Hasty Heart (1949), which turned Todd into a star. He later said he gave up dialogue directing because he found the job \"impossible. My job was to take stars through their lines but I felt that I was also expected to be a spy for the front office. If a word was altered they wanted to know why. It was a way of keeping control.\" The same year his play The Human Touch, co-written with Dudley Leslie, ran for more than a hundred performances at the Savoy Theatre in a production starring Alec Guinness.    British film director     Early films  His first film as a director was Murder Without Crime (1950), made at ABPC, who put Thompson under contract. Thompson was offered £500 for the screen rights to the play and £500 to direct. He said \"it was not so much that I wanted to direct movies it was to get the money so I could continue writing plays. But while directing it I got the feeling that I wanted to be a movie director.\" Thompson said \"the fact is I found directing to be much easier than writing and I enjoyed it much more than writing as well.

Peter Joseph Carril( born July 10, 1930) is an American former basketball coach. He is best known for his time as head coach of Princeton University for 30 years and his use of the' Princeton offense'. He also coached at Lehigh University and in the NBA as an assistant with the Sacramento Kings. Peter Joseph Carril (; July 10, 1930 – August 15, 2022) was an American basketball coach. He is best known as head coach of Princeton University for 30 years and for his use of the \"Princeton offense\". He also coached at Lehigh University and as an assistant with the Sacramento Kings in the National Basketball Association (NBA).    Early life and education  Carril was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on July 10, 1930.  His father, an immigrant from Spain, was employed as a steelworker at Bethlehem Steel for four decades and brought up his son as a single father. Carril attended Liberty High School in his hometown, where he was an all-state selection for Pennsylvania. He then studied at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, playing college basketball for the Lafayette Leopards under Butch van Breda Kolff.  Carril was honored as a Little All-American during his senior year in 1952. While at Lafayette, he became a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. After graduating from college, he served briefly in the U.S. Army.  He later obtained a M.A. degree in educational administration from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1959.    Career     High school coaching  In 1954, Carril was hired as the junior varsity basketball coach and ninth grade Pennsylvania history teacher at Easton Area High School in Easton, Pennsylvania. Four years later, in 1958, Carril was named the varsity coach at Reading Senior High School in Reading, Pennsylvania, where Gary Walters, the former Princeton Tigers athletic director and earlier Princeton basketball point guard played basketball under him at Liberty High School.    Lehigh University  In the 1966-1967 season, Carril was head coach at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.    Princeton University   He then moved to Princeton University. In 29 years, he compiled a 514–261 (.663 winning percentage) record.  He is also the only men's coach to win 500 games without the benefit of athletic scholarships for his players.  He won or shared 13 Ivy League championships and received 11 NCAA tournament berths and 2 NIT bids.  The Tigers won the NIT championship in 1975. Carril's Tigers had the nation's best scoring defense in 14 out of 21 years from 1975 to 1996, including eight in a row from 1988 to 1996.  Games against Princeton were typically low-scoring affairs; for example, the 1990–91 and 1991–92 Tigers are the only teams to hold opponents below 50 points per game since the shot clock became mandatory for the 1985–86 season.  Partly due to these factors, while his Tigers only won three NCAA Tournament games, they were known as a very dangerous first-round opponent; seven of their first round losses were by fewer than ten points. In 1989, Princeton took first-ranked Georgetown down to the wire, leading by eight points at halftime before losing 50–49.  Had the Tigers won, they would have been the first #16 seed to defeat a #1 seed since the NCAA began seeding the tournament field in 1979.  Seven years later, Carril's final collegiate victory was an upset of defending national champions UCLA in the first round of the NCAA tournament in 1996 by a score of 43–41, in what is considered one of the greatest upsets of all time.    Collegiate record and accolades  Carill's career collegiate coaching record, including one season at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, was 525–273.  He was enshrined in both the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997, following his retirement from Princeton.    Sacramento Kings  Carril was an assistant coach for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association for 10 years until his retirement in 2006.  After Rick Adelman became Sacramento's head coach before the 1998–99 season, Carril helped Adelman install the Princeton offensive game plan and oversaw the Kings' development into one of the NBA's most potent offensive teams.  During his tenure, the Kings were noted for their quick-passing offense, as well as their ability to stymie double teaming attempts from their opponents.  In 2007, he volunteered as a coach with the Washington Wizards.  He subsequently rejoined the Kings as an assistant for the 2009 season.    Personal life  Carril was married to Dolores Halteman. They had two children: Peter and Lisa. Barbara Jean Lee (née Tutt; born July 16, 1946) is an American politician and social worker who has been serving as a U.S. representative from California since 1998. A member of the Democratic Party, Lee represents California's 12th congressional district (numbered as the 9th district from 1998 to 2013 and as the 13th district from 2013 to 2023), which is based in Oakland and covers most of the northern part of Alameda County. According to the Cook Partisan Voting Index, it is one of the nation's most Democratic districts, with a rating of D+40. Born and raised in Texas, Lee was educated at Mills College and the University of California, Berkeley. She started her career by working on the presidential campaign of Shirley Chisholm, and she later was involved with the Black Panther Party. After working as chief of staff for U.S. Representative Ron Dellums, Lee served in the California State Assembly from 1990 to 1996 and in the California State Senate from 1996 to 1998. Lee was elected to the House of Representatives in a 1998 special election to succeed Dellums. A noted progressive, she chaired the Congressional Progressive Caucus from 2005 to 2009 and the Congressional Black Caucus from 2009 to 2011. In addition, she is the vice chair and a founding member of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, a co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus, and a co-chair of the House Democratic Steering Committee. She has played a major role in the antiwar movement, notably in her vocal criticism of the Iraq War and for being the only member of Congress to vote against the authorization of use of force following the September 11 attacks. Lee was a candidate for the United States Senate in the 2024 election to succeed late senator Dianne Feinstein, a race that she would lose to Rep. Adam Schiff and former baseball player Steve Garvey. During this race, Lee would forgo re-election to the House of Representatives.    Early life and education  Lee was born Barbara Jean Tutt on July 16, 1946, in El Paso, Texas. She is the oldest of three daughters of Mildred Adaire (née Parish; 1924–2015) and Garvin Alexander Tutt (1924–2007), a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army. When she was born in a segregated hospital, her mother was left in the hallway, as the hospital refused to assist her. Lee is African American; according to a DNA analysis, she descends primarily from the people of Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone. She was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools, where she was taught by the Sisters of Loretto. She was the only African-American Girl Scout in El Paso, and she recalls having faced racial discrimination throughout her childhood. Lee's parents divorced in 1955. Five years later, she moved to California with her mother and two sisters. She attended San Fernando High School in the Pacoima neighborhood of Los Angeles, where she worked with the NAACP to become the school's first African-American cheerleader, and she graduated in 1964. When she was 15, Lee had a back-alley abortion in Ciudad Juárez. She married Carl Lee, a member of the United States Air Force, and moved with him to England after high school; they had two children, and then divorced when Lee was 20. Lee describes the marriage as abusive, and she became homeless following the divorce. She later moved to the Bay Area and attended Mills College, where she served as president of the college's Black Student Union, and she graduated in 1973 with a bachelor of arts in psychology. She later attended the University of California, Berkeley, from where she graduated in 1975 with a master of social work. Throughout college, Lee was a single mother of two on public assistance and food stamps, and she often took her children to class because she was unable to afford child care.    Early political career  Lee worked for the Glendale Welfare Council and later as a statistical clerk for the California Department of Labor Statistics. As president of the Mills College Black Student Union, Lee invited Representative Shirley Chisholm to speak on campus. She was inspired to register to vote by Chisholm's visit, and she went on to work on Chisholm's 1972 presidential campaign, serving as one of her delegates at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. Lee later said Chisholm was a mentor who inspired her to run for office. Also while a student, Lee volunteered at the Oakland chapter of the Black Panther Party's Community Learning Center and worked on Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale's 1973 campaign for mayor of Oakland. Craig Malcolm Robinson (born April 21, 1962) is an American college basketball coach, basketball executive, and broadcaster. He is a former head men's basketball coach at Oregon State University and Brown University. He was a star forward as a player at Princeton University in the early 1980s and a bond trader during the 1990s. He currently is the Executive Director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. He is the brother of former First Lady Michelle Obama and brother-in-law of 44th President of the United States Barack Obama.    Early years   Craig Malcolm Robinson was born on April 21, 1962, in Calumet Park, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson, a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Robinson (née Shields), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store. Robinson grew up in Chicago's South Shore with his younger sister, Michelle. He learned to read by the age of four at home and skipped the second grade in school. He attended the parochial Mount Carmel High School, graduating in 1979 as class valedictorian. When Robinson was considering what college to go to, his father insisted that he attend Princeton University for its Ivy League academics, rather than either the University of Washington or Purdue University, which offered scholarships and major basketball conference play.    Playing career  Robinson, who stands 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) and played forward, was a two-time Ivy League Player of the Year at Princeton University, in 1981–1982 and 1982–1983, leading the league in field goal percentage both years. He is the fourth highest scorer in school history. He graduated in 1983 with a B.A. in Sociology. His senior thesis was on social stratification in prisons. Robinson and former teammate John W. Rogers, Jr. were among those invited to practice with Michael Jordan as he prepared for his comeback. Robinson was drafted in the fourth round of the 1983 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers, but never played in the league. He played professionally for the Manchester Giants in the British Basketball League for two seasons and returned to the U.S. in 1988 to become an assistant coach at the Illinois Institute of Technology, a position he held until 1990.    Business career, marriages, and family   Robinson left basketball partly on the advice of his Princeton coach Pete Carril and pursued a business degree, earning an M.B.A. in Finance from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in 1992. Robinson worked in the 1990s as a bond trader. He became a vice president at Continental Illinois Bank and worked there from 1990 to 1992. He was then a vice president, from 1992 to 1999, at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Later, he was a managing director and partner at Loop Capital Markets, a minority-owned boutique investment banking firm. When Robinson's sister, Michelle, began dating her law firm colleague, Barack Obama, who played basketball recreationally, she asked her brother to play with Obama and give her a character assessment so that she would know whether she could become serious with him. He gave an encouraging report to her. As he later related, \"When I played basketball with Barack, he was quietly confident, which means he had good self-esteem without being cocky. He was certainly a team player – he wasn't a pig, he passed when he was supposed to pass, and he cut when he was supposed to cut. To me, that speaks to a lack of selfishness. He had natural leadership ability because he didn't just pass me the ball because he was dating my sister. Whenever a player gets tired, he reverts to the player he truly is. That's how you tell. And we played for hours. That's how I could tell.\" The story of this pick-up game and of a \"test\" being passed became a key part of the Obama narrative. While working in the business world, Robinson kept a hand in basketball by doing area scouting for Princeton and coaching one year at University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. He earned a high six-figure income in his business career, but he eventually decided the financial world had lost its appeal and found his luxury lifestyle was not enough to save his marriage to Janis Robinson. By 2000, Robinson was going through a divorce. Robinson has two children from his first marriage, a son Avery (born 1992) and a daughter Leslie (born 1996). Robinson remarried in June 2006 to his current wife Kelly. They became parents of sons Austin in 2010 and Aaron in 2012. His daughter Leslie played for the Princeton Tigers women's basketball team as a forward.    Basketball career  Robinson returned to coaching in 1999, making one-tenth his former salary. He was an assistant for six years to Bill Carmody at Northwestern University, where he was an effective recruiter. The Princeton offense is an offensive basketball strategy which emphasizes constant motion, back-door cuts, picks on and off the ball, and disciplined teamwork. It was used and perfected at Princeton University by Pete Carril, though its roots may be traced back to Franklin “Cappy” Cappon, who coached Princeton in the late 1930s, and Bernard \"Red\" Sarachek, who coached at Yeshiva University from 1938 to 1977.    Concept  The offense is designed for a unit of five players who can each pass, shoot, and dribble at an above-average level. These players hope to isolate and exploit a mismatch using these skills. Positions become less important and on offense there is no point guard, shooting guard, small forward or power forward. However, there are certain rules that players running this offense are expected to follow. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc with one player at the top of the key. The ball is kept in constant motion through passing until either a player without the ball cuts toward the unoccupied area under and around the basket, and passes the ball for a layup. The post player is a very important player in the offense. He or she sets up in the high post and draws attention to their positioning. When the ball is received in to the post the players main objective is to find back door cutters or defenders who have fallen asleep on the weak side.  The hallmark of the offense is the backdoor pass, where a player on the wing suddenly moves in towards the basket, receives a bounce pass from a guard on the perimeter, and (if done correctly) finds himself with no defenders between him and a layup.  Alternatively, when the defensive team attempts to pack the paint to prevent backdoor cuts, the offense utilizes three point shots from the perimeter.  All five players in the offense—including the center—should be competent at making a three-point attempt, further spreading the floor, and not allowing the defense to leave any player unattended. The offense is often a very slowly developing one, relying on a high number of passes, and is often used in college basketball by teams facing opponents with superior athletic talent in order to maintain a low-scoring game (believing that a high-scoring game would favor the athletically superior opponent). As a result, Princeton has led the nation in scoring defense 19 times including in every year from 1989 to 2000.    Use at Princeton  During his tenure as head coach of Princeton (1967–1996), Pete Carril compiled a 514–261 record, a .658 winning percentage. His teams won 13 Ivy League championships during his 29-year tenure with the Tigers, and received 11 NCAA Tournament bids and two National Invitation Tournament berths. Princeton captured the NIT title in 1975. Perhaps Carril's greatest win was his final upset victory on a backdoor cut to give Princeton the win 43 - 41 over the 1995 defending NCAA champion UCLA. The win extended Coach Carril's retirement by one game and is ranked as one of the best NCAA upsets of all time. Former Princeton coach Sydney Johnson and his predecessors Bill Carmody, John Thompson III, and Joe Scott have all employed the Princeton offense.    Other examples of use     National Basketball Association  After his retirement from Princeton in 1996, Pete Carril served as an assistant coach for the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings until 2006. During his time with Sacramento, Carril helped Rick Adelman, who became the Kings' head coach in 1998, implement the Princeton offense. Carril returned to the Kings during the 2008–2009 season as a consultant. The Cleveland Cavaliers, Los Angeles Lakers, New Orleans Hornets, New Jersey Nets, and Washington Wizards also have run versions of the Princeton offense. Rick Adelman introduced a modified version of Pete Carril's system to the Houston Rockets during the 2007–2008 season. Coach Alvin Gentry also implemented an altered version of it that shows similarities to the triangle offense during the Phoenix Suns′s 2012–13 season.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "answer": "yes",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Are the directors of films Fire Down Below (1957 film) and Playing the Game both from the same country?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nAn action role-playing game (often abbreviated action RPG or ARPG) is a subgenre of video games that combines core elements from both the action game and role-playing genre.    Definition  Action role-playing games emphasize real-time combat where the player has direct control over the characters as opposed to turn or menu-based combat while still having a focus on character's stats in order to determine relative strength and abilities. These games often use action game combat systems similar to hack and slash or shooter games. The term \"action role-playing game\" may also describe action-adventure games, which include a mission system and role-playing game mechanics, as well as MMORPGs with real-time combat systems.    History     1970s and early 1980s  Allgame listed the following games released prior to 1984 as action RPGs: Temple of Apshai (1979) and its sequel Gateway to Apshai (1983), Beneath the Pyramids for the Apple II (1980), Bokosuka Wars (1983), and Sword of Fargoal (1983). Jeremy Parish of USgamer claimed that Adventure (1980) was an action RPG. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton claimed that the Intellivision games Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (1982) and Treasure of Tarmin (1983) were action RPGs. Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade notes that Adventure lacked RPG mechanics such as experience points and permanent character growth, and argues that Gateway to Apshai is \"the earliest game I'd feel comfortable calling an action-RPG\" but notes that \"it doesn't fit neatly into our modern genre classifications\", though came closer than Bokosuka Wars released the same year. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com argues that Japanese developers created a new brand of action role-playing game; these new Japanese games combined the role-playing genre with arcade-style action and action-adventure elements. Shaun Musgrave of TouchArcade also traces the genre's roots to Japan, noting that the \"Western game industry of the time had a tendency to treat action games and RPGs as separate things for separate demographics\". Jeremy Parish argues that action RPGs were popularized in Japan by The Tower of Druaga. It was released for arcades in June 1984, and was intended as a \"fantasy version of Pac-Man, with puzzles to solve, monsters to battle, and hidden treasure to find\". Its success in Japan inspired the development of Dragon Slayer (1984) and Hydlide (1984). Dragon Slayer, Hydlide and Courageous Perseus (1984) \"vie for position as genre precedent\" according to John Szczepaniak, and there was an ongoing rivalry developing between the Dragon Slayer and Hydlide series over the years. The Tower of Druaga, Dragon Slayer and Hydlide were influential in Japan, where they influenced later action RPGs such as Ys, as well as The Legend of Zelda.: 38  Falcom's Dragon Slayer, created by Yoshio Kiya, is \"the very first action-RPG ever made\" according to GameSetWatch. Originally released for the PC-8801 computer in September 1984, it abandoned the command-based battles of earlier role-playing games in favor of real-time hack-and-slash combat that required direct input from the player, alongside puzzle-solving elements. In contrast to earlier turn-based roguelikes, Dragon Slayer was a dungeon-crawl role-playing game using real-time, action-oriented combat, combined with traditional role-playing mechanics.  Dragon Slayer's overhead action role-playing formula was used in many later games. T&E Soft's Hydlide, released in December 1984, was created by Tokihiro Naito, who was influenced by The Tower of Druaga.: 42–49  It was the first action RPG with an overworld. The game was immensely popular in Japan, selling 2 million copies across all platforms. According to John Szczepaniak, it \"cannot be overstated how influential Hydlide was on the ARPGs which followed it\". The same year, Courageous Perseus was also one of the earliest action RPGs. Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu, released in 1985 (billed as a \"new type of real-time role-playing game\"), was an action role-playing game including many character stats and a large quest. It also incorporated a side-scrolling view during exploration and an overhead view during battle, and an early \"Karma\" morality system where the character's Karma meter will rise if he commits sin (killing \"good\" enemies), which in turn causes the temples to refuse to level him up. Xanadu Scenario II, released in 1986, was an expansion pack, created to expand the content of Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu. Hydlide II: Shine of Darkness (1985) also featured a morality system. The Living Idol is a 1957 film. Limbo is a popular game, based on traditions that originated on the island of Tobago.  The aim is to pass forwards under a low bar without falling or dislodging the bar. The dance originated as an event that took place at wakes in Tobago.  It was popularized in the 1950s by dance pioneer Julia Edwards (known as the First Lady of Limbo) and her company which appeared in several films, in particular Fire Down Below (1957), and toured widely in the Caribbean, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Africa in the 1960s and later.    Rules  A horizontal bar, known as the limbo bar, is supported by two vertical bars. All contestants must attempt to go under the bar with their backs facing toward the floor. When passing under the bar, players must bend backwards. No part of their body is allowed to touch the bar, and no part other than their feet may touch the ground. They must not turn their head or neck to the side. Whoever knocks the bar off or falls is eliminated. After everyone has passed under the bar in this manner, the bar is lowered slightly and the contest continues. The contest ends when only one person can pass under the bar.    History  The word 'limbo' dates back to the 1950s. It is conjectured that limbo is a West Indian English derivative of 'limber'.    Merriam–Webster lists the etymology as \"English of Tobago & Barbados; akin to Jamaican English limba to bend, from English limber\".     This game is also used as a funeral game and may be related to the African legba or legua game.Consistent with certain African beliefs, the game reflects the whole cycle of life....The players move under a pole that is gradually lowered from chest level and they emerge on the other side as their heads clear the pole as in the triumph of life over death. The limbo dates back to the mid to late 1800s in Tobago. It achieved mainstream popularity during the 1950s. An alternative explanation of the name is suggested; that the version of the limbo performed in nineteenth century Tobago was meant to symbolize slaves entering the galleys of a slave ship, or a spirit crossing over into the afterworld, or \"limbo\", but no literary reference is known to substantiate this postulated linkage. Dr Alan Rice elaborates on the supposed link the game has with the slave trade: \"Africans were forced to game on deck for exercise. Many took advantage of this to bond and communicate with their shipmates by dancing steps remembered from their past in Africa. This was to continue in the Americas in games, religious ceremonies and other musical forms that used cultural traditions from Africa. One such game was the limbo in the Caribbean. The limbo spoke directly of the limited space in the slaving ships and the African ability to escape it.\"    Popularization   Traditionally, the limbo game began at the lowest possible bar height and the bar was gradually raised, signifying an emergence from death into life.  In its adaptation to the world of entertainment, troupes began reversing the traditional order.   According to a 1956 newspaper report, the game was revived in 1944 by Edric Connor.  It became a popular entertainment in Trinidad and was adopted as a physical fitness exercise by American troops.    In the 1950s, choreographer and player Julia Edwards added a number of features that are now considered standard, such as human 'bars' formed by the limbs of other players and the use of fire in the performance of limbo.   A film, Julia and Joyce, by Trinidadian-American Sonja Dumas, was released in 2010. It traces the evolution of limbo dancing and the contribution of Edwards to its popularity. Limbo players generally move and respond to a number of specific Afro-Caribbean drum patterns. As Limbo gained popularity as a tourist activity and a form of entertainment, pop music began using Caribbean rhythms to respond to the emerging craze in the United States. One example is the song \"Limbo Rock\" (recorded by Chubby Checker), which became a number 2 charted hit on the Billboard Top 100, from which emerged the popular quote/chant that is associated with limbo which Checker also helped to popularize: \"How low can you go?\" Limbo was brought into the mainstream by Trinidadian Calypsonian Brigo (Samuel Abrahams) with his popular Soca song \"Limbo Break\". Limbo is considered the unofficial national game of Trinidad and Tobago,  which refers to itself as the land of limbo, steelpan (steel drums), and calypso. After a preparatory game, the player prepares and approaches the bar, lowering and leaning back their body while balancing on feet akimbo with knees extended backwards. Amabel Ethelreid Normand (November 9, 1893 – February 23, 1930), better known as Mabel Normand, was an American silent film actress, director and screenwriter. She was a popular star and collaborator of Mack Sennett in their Keystone Studios films, and at the height of her career in the late 1910s and early 1920s had her own film studio and production company, the Mabel Normand Feature Film Company. On screen, she appeared in twelve successful films with Charlie Chaplin and seventeen with Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle, sometimes writing and directing (or co-writing and directing) films featuring Chaplin as her leading man. Normand's name was repeatedly linked with gun violence, including the 1922 murder of her friend, director William Desmond Taylor, and the non-fatal 1924 shooting of Courtland S. Dines by Normand's chauffeur, Joe Kelly. After police interrogation, she was ruled out as a suspect in Taylor's murder. Normand was a very heavy smoker who may have suffered lung cancer, and/or a recurrence of tuberculosis in 1923, which led to a decline in her health, an early retirement from films in 1926 and her death in 1930 at age 36.    Early life and career   Amabel Ethelreid Normand was born in New Brighton, New York (before it was incorporated into New York City as part of Staten Island) on November 9, 1893. She took her name from her father's only sibling, who had died before her birth in 1892. Normand's mother, Mary \"Minnie\" Drury, of Providence, Rhode Island, was of Irish heritage; while her father, Clodman \"Claude\" George Normand, was French Canadian, with his ancestral lineage dating back to Normandy in France and their surname originally being LeNormand or Le Normand. For a short time at the start of her career, Normand worked for Vitagraph Studios in New York City for $25 per week, but Vitagraph founder Albert E. Smith admitted she was one of several actresses about whom he made a mistake in estimating their \"potential for future stardom.\" Normand's intensely beguiling lead performance in the 1911 dramatic short film Her Awakening, directed by D. W. Griffith, drew her attention and led to her meeting director Mack Sennett while at Griffith's Biograph Company. The two subsequently embarked on a chaotic relationship. Sennett later brought Normand to California when he founded Keystone Studios in 1912.  Normand appeared with Charlie Chaplin and Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle in many short films. She played a key role in starting Chaplin's film career and acted as his leading lady and mentor in a string of films in 1914, collaborating with him as a director, co-director or co-writer. Chaplin had considerable initial difficulty adjusting to the demands of film acting, and his performance suffered for it. After his first film appearance in Making a Living, Sennett felt he had made a costly mistake. However, Normand persuaded Sennett to give Chaplin another chance, and she and Chaplin appeared together in a dozen subsequent films, almost always as a couple in the lead roles. At the start of 1914, Chaplin first played his Tramp character in Mabel's Strange Predicament, although it wound up being the second Tramp film released; Normand directed Chaplin and herself in the film. Later that year, Normand starred with Chaplin and Marie Dressler in Tillie's Punctured Romance, the first feature-length comedy. Normand is credited as being the first film star to receive a pie thrown in the face.  Normand opened her own film company in partnership with Sennett in 1916, based in Culver City, California. She lost the company in 1918 when its parent company, Triangle Film Corporation, experienced a massive shakeup which also had Sennett lose Keystone Studios and establish his own independent company. In 1918, as her relationship with Sennett came to an end, Normand signed a $3,500-per-week contract with Samuel Goldwyn. Around that same time, Normand allegedly had a miscarriage (or stillbirth) with Goldwyn's child.    Scandals     Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle trials  Arbuckle, Normand's co-star in many films, was the defendant in three widely publicized trials for manslaughter in the 1921 death of actress Virginia Rappe. Although Arbuckle was acquitted, the scandal damaged his career and his films were banned from exhibition for a short time. Since she had made some of her most notable works with him, much of Normand's output was withheld from the public as a result. Fire Down Below is a 1957 Anglo- American adventure drama film with a screenplay written by novelist Irwin Shaw, starring Rita Hayworth, Robert Mitchum and Jack Lemmon, and directed by Robert Parrish. Based on Max Catto's 1954 novel with the same title, the picture was made by Warwick Films on location in Trinidad and Tobago, in Technicolor and CinemaScope, and released by Columbia Pictures. == Plot ==\nAfter the Korean War, Americans Tony and Felix own a tramp boat, the Ruby, which they use for small-scale smuggling around the Caribbean, along with a third crewman, Jimmy Jean. One day their bartender contact, Miguel, introduces them to an American businessman who has been enjoying the company of beautiful but passport-less European goddess Irena. He has to return to Detroit, but wants to arrange for her to get to another island. They are reluctant, but $1,200 proves very tempting.\nOn the voyage, Tony starts falling in love with her. Knowing the kind of woman she is, Felix does his best to protect his partner by warning Irena to stay away from Tony. However, Felix starts falling for her himself. When she disembarks, Tony goes with her, ending his partnership with Felix.\nTony visits a drunk Felix and offers a final job together, but Felix rejects the offer, feeling hurt by his friend's abandonment, and warns that Irena will leave him. Though Jimmy brushes it off.\nTony and Jimmy Jean take on a shady job, but are intercepted by the authorities. They have to abandon ship and swim to a nearby island to avoid arrest. Tony takes a job on a cargo ship to get back to Irena. He also plans to kill Felix, correctly suspecting that his former partner tipped off the customs agents to get rid of the competition for Irena. However, while Tony is away, she goes to Felix and confesses that she loves him.\nAfter a collision, Tony is trapped below deck under a girder, with time running out – the ship is aflame and carrying a highly explosive cargo. Doctor Sam Blake offers the only way out, by amputating Tony's trapped legs, but Tony would rather die. Felix goes aboard and stays with him. An explosion frees Tony from the wreckage, and Felix carries him to safety.\nAfter Tony has recovered, he confronts Felix and Irena in a bar. It is there Tony realises that Irena loves Felix and not him, leaving him to walk away and cut his losses by saying, \"Some days you win, some days you lose.\"\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was Rita Hayworth's return to motion pictures after a four-year absence. The producer and part-owner of the production company Warwick Films, Albert R. Broccoli, later to become famous as the producer of the first 16 Eon-made James Bond films, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a drug smuggler.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film had a gala premiere in the attendance of Princess Alexandra of Kent at the Odeon Marble Arch in London on 30 May 1957, and went on general release in Britain the next day. It premiered in the USA two months later, on 8 August 1957.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nThe film needed to make $5,500,000 to break even, and by October 1957 was going to come in $750,000 short. This financial failure caused Warwick Films to scale back its production.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe theme song, \"Fire Down Below\", was composed by Lester Lee, with lyrics by Ned Washington, and was sung by Jeri Southern.\nAll harmonica themes in this film were composed and played by Jack Lemmon.\nThe film's soundtrack score was conducted by Muir Mathieson with the Sinfonia of London.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1957 Robert R. Parrish( January 4, 1916 December 4, 1995) was an American film director, editor, writer, and child actor. He received an Academy Award for Film Editing for his contribution to\" Body and Soul\"( 1947). Robert Reese Parrish (January 4, 1916 – December 4, 1995) was an American film director, editor and former child actor. He won an Academy Award for Best Film Editing for his work on Body and Soul (1947).    Life and career   Born in Columbus, Georgia, Parrish was the son of Coca-Cola salesman Gordon R. Parrish  and actress Laura Virginia (née Reese) Parrish. The Parrish siblings, including Beverly and Helen, entered into acting in the 1920s when the family moved to Los Angeles.    Acting  Parrish made his debut film appearance in the Our Gang short Olympic Games (1927). He then appeared in the classic Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927); Yale vs. Harvard (1928), another Our Gang short; Mother Machree (1928) and Four Sons (1928) from John Ford; Speedy (1928) with Harold Lloyd; Riley the Cop (1928) for Ford; The Iron Mask (1929) with Douglas Fairbanks; The Divine Lady (1929); The Racketeer (1929); Anna Christie (1930) with Greta Garbo; the anti-war film All Quiet on the Western Front (1930); The Big Trail (1930) with John Wayne; Up the River (1930) for Ford; The Right to Love (1930) with Ruth Chatterton; Charles Chaplin's City Lights (1931); Scandal Sheet (1931); I Take This Woman (1931); Forbidden (1932) for Frank Capra; The Miracle Man (1932); and Scandal for Sale (1932). Parrish was in This Day and Age (1932) for Cecil B. de Mille; Doctor Bull (1933), Judge Priest (1934), The Whole Town's Talking (1935), and The Informer (1935) for Ford; The Crusades (1935) for de Mille; Steamboat Round the Bend (1935) and The Prisoner of Shark Island (1936) for Ford; Shipmates Forever (1936); One in a Million (1936) and Thin Ice (1937) with Sonia Henie; History Is Made at Night (1937) for Frank Borzage; Thrill of a Lifetime (1938); Having Wonderful Time (1938); Mr. Doodle Kicks Off (1938); and Dramatic School (1938).    Editor  John Ford encouraged Parrish to work behind the scenes and put him on as an editing apprentice on The Informer. He later hired Parrish as assistant editor for Mary of Scotland (1936). He worked on Ford films behind the scenes in editing and sound capacities, including Stagecoach (1939), Young Mr Lincoln (1939), Drums Along the Mohawk (1939), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), The Long Voyage Home (1940) and Tobacco Road (1941). Both Ford and Parrish served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, and together they also produced a number of documentary and training films, including The Battle of Midway (1942), How to Operate Behind Enemy Lines (1943), German Industrial Manpower, and December 7th: The Movie (1943). Parrish also worked as editor on George Stevens' That Justice Be Done (1945), and The Nazi Plan (1945). When Parrish got out of the navy, he helped edit Robert Rossen's boxing drama Body and Soul (1947). In 1947, Parrish shared the Academy Award, with co-nominee Francis Lyon, for his work on the film. Parrish went on to edit A Double Life (1947) for George Cukor, No Minor Vices (1948) for Lewis Milestone, and Caught (1949) for Max Ophüls. Parrish's second Academy Award nomination, shared with Al Clark, was for the political drama directed by Rossen, All the King's Men (1949). In the first versions done by Al Clark, the film was poorly received by preview audiences and studio executives. Parrish discovered that a \"montage approach\" was much more successful, with arbitrary cuts made a set time before and after each important action. In addition to the editing nomination for Clark and Parrish, the film won the Best Picture Award outright and was a popular success. He also edited No Sad Songs for Me (1950) and A Woman of Distinction (1950), as well as the documentary Of Men and Music (1951).    Directing  Parrish made his directorial debut with the revenge drama Cry Danger (1951). A massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) is a video game that combines aspects of a role-playing video game and a massively multiplayer online game. As in role-playing games (RPGs), the player assumes the role of a character (often in a fantasy world or science-fiction world) and takes control over many of that character's actions. MMORPGs are distinguished from single-player or small multi-player online RPGs by the number of players able to interact together, and by the game's persistent world (usually hosted by the game's publisher), which continues to exist and evolve while the player is offline and away from the game. MMORPGs are played throughout the world. Global revenues for MMORPGs exceeded half a billion dollars in 2005, and the western world's revenues exceeded a billion dollars in 2006. In 2008, the spending on subscription MMORPGs by consumers in North America and Europe grew to $1.4 billion. World of Warcraft, a popular MMORPG, had over 10 million subscribers as of November 2014. World of Warcraft's total revenue was $1.04 billion US dollars in 2014. Star Wars: The Old Republic, released in 2011, became the world's \"fastest-growing subscription MMO in history\" after gaining more than 1 million players within the first three days of its launch.    Common features  Although modern MMORPGs sometimes differ dramatically from their predecessors, many of them share the same basic characteristics. These include several common features:  persistent game environment some form of level progression social interaction within the game in-game culture membership in a group character customization.    Themes  The majority of popular MMORPGs are based on traditional fantasy themes, often occurring in an in-game universe comparable to that of Dungeons & Dragons. Some employ hybrid themes that either merge or replace fantasy elements with those of science fiction, sword and sorcery, or crime fiction. Others draw thematic material from American comic books, the occult, and other genres. These elements are often developed using similar tasks and scenarios involving quests, monsters, and loot.    Progression  In nearly all MMORPGs, the development of the player's character is the primary goal. Nearly all MMORPGs feature a character progression system, in which players earn experience points for their actions and use those points to reach character \"levels\", which makes them better at whatever they do. Traditionally, combat with monsters and completing quests for non-player characters, either alone or in groups, are the primary ways to earn experience points. The accumulation of wealth (including combat-useful items) is also a way to progress in many MMORPGs. This is traditionally best accomplished via combat. The cycle produced by these conditions, combat leading to new items allowing for more combat with no change in gameplay, is sometimes pejoratively referred to as the level treadmill, or \"grinding\". The role-playing game Progress Quest was created as a parody of this trend. Eve Online, a space-based MMORPG, uses an alternative method of progression where users train skills in real-time rather than using experience points as a measure of progression. In some MMORPGs, there is no limit to a player's level, allowing the grinding experience to continue indefinitely. MMORPGs that use this model often glorify top ranked players by displaying their avatars on the game's website or posting their stats on a high score screen. Another common practice is to enforce a maximum reachable level for all players, often referred to as a level cap. Once reached, the definition of a player's progression changes. Instead of being awarded primarily with experience for completing quests and dungeons, the player's motivation to continue playing will be replaced with collecting money and equipment. Often, the widened range of equipment available at the maximum level will have increased aesthetic value to distinguish high ranking players in game between lower ranked players. Colloquially known as endgame gear, this set of empowered weapons and armor adds a competitive edge to both scripted boss encounters as well as player vs player combat. Player motivation to outperform others is fueled by acquiring such items and is a significant determining factor in their success or failure in combat-related situations.    Social interaction   MMORPGs almost always have tools to facilitate communication between players. Many MMORPGs offer support for in-game guilds or clans, though these will usually form whether the game supports them or not. In addition, most MMOGs require some degree of teamwork in parts of the game. These tasks usually require players to take on roles in the group, such as protecting other players from damage (called tanking), \"healing\" damage done to other players or damaging enemies. MMORPGs generally have Game Moderators or Game Masters (frequently referred to as GMs or \"mods\"), who may be paid employees or unpaid volunteers who attempt to supervise the world. Fire Down Below may refer to: Ted Curson Plays Fire Down Below is an album by American trumpeter Ted Curson which was recorded in 1962 and released on the Prestige label. Casino Royale is a 1967 spy parody film originally distributed by Columbia Pictures featuring an ensemble cast. It is loosely based on the 1953 novel of the same name by Ian Fleming, the first novel to feature the character James Bond. The film stars David Niven as the \"original\" Bond, Sir James Bond 007. Forced out of retirement to investigate the deaths and disappearances of international spies, he soon battles the mysterious Dr. Noah and SMERSH. The film's tagline: \"Casino Royale is too much... for one James Bond!\" refers to Bond's ruse to mislead SMERSH in which six other agents are pretending to be \"James Bond\", namely, baccarat master Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers); millionaire spy Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress); Bond's secretary Miss Moneypenny (Barbara Bouchet); Bond's daughter with Mata Hari, Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet); and British agents Coop (Terence Cooper) and the Detainer (Daliah Lavi). Charles K. Feldman, the producer, had acquired the film rights in 1960 and had attempted to get Casino Royale made as an Eon Productions Bond film; however, Feldman and the producers of the Eon series, Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, failed to come to terms. Believing that he could not compete with the Eon series, Feldman resolved to produce the film as a satire. The budget escalated as various directors and writers became involved in the production, and actors expressed dissatisfaction with the project. Released on 13 April 1967, two months prior to Eon's fifth Bond film, You Only Live Twice, Casino Royale was a financial success, grossing over $41.7 million worldwide, and Burt Bacharach's musical score was praised, earning him an Academy Award nomination for the song \"The Look of Love\", performed on the film's soundtrack by Dusty Springfield. Critical reaction, however, was generally negative, with many reviewers regarding it as a baffling, disorganised affair. Since 1999, rights have been held by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, distributors of the Bond films by Eon Productions.    Plot  Sir James Bond 007, a legendary British spy who retired 20 years earlier, is visited by M, the head of British MI6, CIA representative Ransome, KGB representative Smernov, and Deuxième Bureau representative Le Grand. All implore Bond to come out of retirement to deal with SMERSH, who have been eliminating agents, but Bond spurns their pleas. His mansion is destroyed by a mortar at the orders of M, who is killed in the explosion. Bond returns M's remains (a toupée) to his widow, Lady Fiona McTarry, at M's Scottish estate. However, the real Lady Fiona has been replaced by SMERSH's Agent Mimi. The household has been replaced with beautiful women. SMERSH aims to destroy Bond's \"celibate image\". The bevy of beauties fail to seduce Bond, and Mimi/Lady Fiona is so impressed that she helps Bond foil the plot against him and joins a convent. On his way back to London, Bond survives another attempt on his life and is named head of MI6. He learns that many British agents around the world have been eliminated by enemy spies because of their inability to resist sex. Bond also learns that the \"sex maniac\" who was given the name \"James Bond\" when he retired has gone to work in television. To confuse SMERSH and expose their masterplan, Bond orders that all remaining MI6 agents be named \"James Bond 007\". He creates a rigorous programme to train male agents to ignore the female charm. Moneypenny recruits Coop, a karate expert, and meets an exotic agent known as the Detainer. Bond hires Vesper Lynd, a retired agent turned millionaire, to recruit baccarat expert Evelyn Tremble, whom he intends to use to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre has embezzled SMERSH's money and is desperate to cover up his theft before he is executed. Following a clue from Agent Mimi, Bond instructs his estranged daughter, Mata Bond, to travel to West Berlin and infiltrate International Mothers' Help, an au pair service that is actually a SMERSH training centre. Mata uncovers a plan to sell compromising photographs of military leaders from the US, USSR, China, and Great Britain at an \"art auction\", another money-raising scheme from Le Chiffre. Mata destroys the photos, leaving baccarat as Le Chiffre's only remaining option. Evelyn arrives at the Casino Royale accompanied by Vesper, who foils an attempt by seductive SMERSH agent Miss Goodthighs to disable him. Victor L. Schertzinger( April 8, 1888- October 26, 1941) was an American composer, film director, film producer, and screenwriter. His films include\" Paramount on Parade\"( co-director, 1930),\" Something to Sing About\"( 1937) with James Cagney, and the first two\" Road\" pictures\" Road to Singapore\"( 1940) and\" Road to Zanzibar\"( 1941). His two best- known songs are\" I Remember You\" and\" Tangerine\", both with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and both featured in Schertzinger's final film,\" The Fleet's In\"( 1942). == Life and career ==\nSchertzinger was born in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, the child of musical parents of Pennsylvania Dutch descent, and attracted attention as a violin prodigy at the age of four.\nAs a child of eight, he appeared as a violinist with several orchestras, including the Victor Herbert Orchestra and the John Philip Sousa band. In his teens, he attended the Brown Preparatory School in Philadelphia, and gave violin performances while touring America and Europe.\nSchertzinger studied music at the University of Brussels. He continued to distinguish himself as a concert violinist, and then as a symphony conductor. He also worked as a songwriter, adding three songs with lyrics by producer Oliver Morosco to L. Frank Baum and Louis F. Gottschalk's musical, The Tik-Tok Man of Oz (1914).\n\nHis first brush with the film industry came in 1916, when Thomas Ince commissioned him to compose the orchestral accompaniment for his great silent film Civilization. Remaining under Ince's employment, Schertzinger became principal director of the popular Charles Ray films, establishing a rapport with the mercurial Ray that few of the star's other collaborators would ever achieve.\nAfter the introduction of sound, Schertzinger continued to direct films but also began to compose songs for them, and in some instances writing scripts or producing as well. Although closely associated with Paramount Pictures, Schertzinger actually spent the 1930s as a freelancer.\nSome of his best films, such as One Night of Love (1934) and The Mikado (1939) exploited his vast knowledge of the world of music. His songwriting collaborators during this period also included Gus Kahn, Johnny Burke and Frank Loesser.\nSchertzinger married Julia E. Nicklin, to whom he remained married until his death. They had two daughters, Patricia and Paula.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSchertzinger died unexpectedly from a heart attack in Hollywood at the age of 53, having just finished work on The Fleet's In (1942). He had directed 89 films, and had composed music for more than 50 films.\nThe Hollywood Walk of Fame contains a star for Schertzinger at 1611 Vine Street.\nIn his home town of Mahanoy City, an official marker from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission indicates the location of the Schertzinger homestead and jewelry store where Schertzinger grew up. The marker reads:\n\nViolin prodigy who performed with John Philip Sousa and later became a film director and composer. He pioneered the use of original film music for films, and his film 'One Night of Love' won best musical score and sound recording Oscars in 1934. He composed the pop standard 'Tangerine.' Among many films he directed were two of the Hope and Crosby 'Road' movies. He was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His childhood home was here.\nSchertzinger's two best-known songs, \"I Remember You\" and \"Tangerine\", continue to appear in the soundtracks of new films.\nSchertzinger also appears as a recurring character in the Epic Short Story The Organ of Love.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nThe following information comes from the Internet Movie Database.

Albert Romolo Broccoli ( BROK-ə-lee; April 5, 1909 – June 27, 1996), nicknamed \"Cubby\", was an American film producer who made more than 40 motion pictures throughout his career. Most of the films were made in the United Kingdom and  often filmed at Pinewood Studios. Co-founder of Danjaq, LLC and Eon Productions, Broccoli is most notable as the producer of many of the James Bond films. He and Harry Saltzman saw the films develop from relatively low-budget origins to large-budget, high-grossing extravaganzas, and Broccoli's heirs continue to produce new Bond films.    Early life and career  Broccoli was born in the borough of Queens, New York City, the younger of two children of immigrants from the Calabria region of Italy, Giovanni Broccoli and Kristina Vence. He had an older brother. He acquired his nickname after his cousin, mobster Pat DiCicco, began calling him \"Kabibble\", after a similarly named cartoon character. This was eventually shortened to \"Kubbie\" and adopted by Broccoli as \"Cubby\". The family later bought a farm in Smithtown, New York, on Long Island, near their relatives the DiCiccos. The family moved to Florida, and on the death of his father Giovanni, Broccoli moved to live with his grandmother in Astoria, Queens, in New York City. Having worked many jobs, including casket maker, Broccoli then became involved in the film industry. He started at the bottom, working as a gofer on Howard Hughes' The Outlaw (1941), which starred Jane Russell. Here he met his lifelong friend Howard Hughes for the first time, while Hughes was overseeing the movie's production after director Howard Hawks was fired. Broccoli rose quickly to the level of assistant director by the time the U.S. entered World War II. In 1951, he and Irving Allen created Warwick Films in order to take advantage of tax incentives available to them by producing films in the United Kingdom with British crews, while often using American stars. Among the films they produced are The Red Beret (1953), Hell Below Zero (1954), The Black Knight (1954), The Gamma People (1956), Safari (1956),  Fire Down Below (1957), and The Trials of Oscar Wilde (1960), among others. The Allen-Broccoli partnership ended in part due to a disagreement over acquiring film rights to the James Bond novels as Allen felt they were of poor quality. Broccoli partnered instead with Harry Saltzman in 1961 to form Eon Productions, which would produce the Bond series. (See Production of the James Bond films)    Ted Healy incident  Broccoli is alleged to have been involved in an altercation with comedian and Three Stooges creator Ted Healy outside the Trocadero nightclub, just before the latter's death in 1937. A source alleged that actor Wallace Beery, Broccoli, and film producer Pat DiCicco beat Healy so badly that he fell into a coma and died. There is no documentation in contemporaneous news reports that either Beery or DiCicco was present, allegedly because the investigation and any subsequent newspaper coverage would be routinely sidelined by the MGM studio fixers, Eddie Mannix and Howard Strickling (Mannix would later become a producer and executive for MGM), since Wallace Beery was one of MGM's most highly-paid and important actors. Beery was immediately dispatched to a long vacation in Europe until the story died down. Broccoli admitted that he was indeed involved in a fist fight with Healy at the Trocadero. He later modified his story, stating that a heavily intoxicated Healy had picked a fight with him, the two had briefly scuffled, then shook hands and parted ways. In other reports, Broccoli admitted to pushing Healy, but not striking him. There is disagreement over whether Healy died as a result of the brawl or due to his well-known alcoholism. Because of the authorities' lack of interest in investigating Healy's death, an autopsy was not performed until after Healy's body had been embalmed, rendering the examiner's note that Healy's organs were \"soaked in alcohol\" useless in determining a cause of death. Following the autopsy, the Los Angeles county coroner reported that Healy died of acute toxic nephritis secondary to acute and chronic alcoholism. Police closed their investigation, as there was no indication in the report that his death was caused by physical assault.    Personal life  Broccoli married three times. In 1940, at the age of 31, he married actress Gloria Blondell, the younger sister of Joan Blondell. They later divorced amicably in 1945 without having had children. In 1951, he married Nedra Clark, widow of the singer Buddy Clark. Playing the Game is a 1918 American silent comedy drama film directed by Victor Schertzinger and written by Julien Josephson and R. Cecil Smith. The film stars Charles Ray, Doris May, Harry L. Rattenberry, Robert McKim, William Elmer, and Leota Lorraine. The film was released on May 5, 1918, by Paramount Pictures. It is not known whether the film currently survives, and it may be a lost film. == Plot ==\nAs described in a film magazine, believing that killed a professional dancer in a cafe brawl, Larry Prentiss (Ray) along with his valet Hodges (Elmer) flee to the west to where he owns a ranch. The two are waylaid, robbed of their clothes, and set adrift. In this condition they are picked up by the foreman of Larry's ranch, Flash Purdy (McKim). Larry, wanting to make good on his merits, refuses to make known his identity. Hardships follow in which Larry incurs the enmity of Flash Purdy. Larry later saves the ranch payroll during a running gun fight and in the midst of a hand-to-hand struggle learns that Moya Shannon (May), daughter of the ranch manager, loves him. In the days that follow he squares his account with Purdy, but his adventure comes to a close when his identity becomes known after he receives a telegram from his uncle.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nCharles Ray as Larry Prentiss\nDoris May as Moya Shannon\nHarry L.

The song was written by Björk and was produced by Nellee Hooper, who produced the majority of her debut album. The single was released in August 1993 by One Little Indian, a month after the release of the album. The song was inspired by a boy who saw everything from a \"beauty point of view\". \"Venus as a Boy\" is an ambient and chill-out song that features a musical ensemble made up of Indian instruments like tablas. The song received mixed reviews from critics, who discussed Björk's musical shift. Despite becoming a chart-topping hit in Björk's native Iceland, the song did not chart well internationally apart from entering the UK Singles Chart top 30. The accompanying music video was directed by the British music video director Sophie Muller. The clip shows Björk in a kitchen cooking eggs, and was inspired by the singer's favorite book Story of the Eye. Björk performed the song on different TV appearances, including Top of the Pops, and sang it during the course of her Debut tour. The song was later chosen by fans to be included in her greatest hits album, Greatest Hits, and also appeared in her Family Tree Box Set which contained a \"greatest hits\" disc on which the songs were chosen by Björk. In 2003, Q Magazine ranked \"Venus as a Boy\" at number 610 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\".    Background and inspiration  The song was written by Björk and was produced by Nellee Hooper. It was one of the last tracks to be recorded for the album. The song was inspired by a \"specific person\"  but Björk never revealed who it was. Although, it is supposed that this specific person is Dominic Thrupp (also known as Dom T.) with whom Björk had a relationship at the time of writing. Moreover, the song talks about a boy who saw everything from a \"beauty point of view, and not superficial beauty but the beauty of brushing your teeth and the beauty of waking up in the morning in the right beat and the beauty of having a conversation with a person.\" as revealed by the singer. The B-sides were \"Stígðu Mig\" (\"Step Me\"), a song originally recorded by The Elgar Sisters; a group formed in the early eighties by guitarist Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson and Björk, written by Björk, Guðlaugur and Thór Eldon. The other B-side is \"I Remember You\", a cover of the classic love song written by Victor Schertzinger and Johnny Mercer, that was recorded together with \"Like Someone in Love\", but did not make the cut as the latter did. In both songs Corky Hale plays the Harp.    Composition   \"Venus as a Boy\" has been described as an ambient and chill-out song. Its sound reflected Björk's newly found interest in Bollywood, having befriended people of Indian origin in London, most notably tabla player Talvin Singh, who would later collaborate on the track. She described the composition of the song in an interview with David Hemingway:   \"I think I wrote it in my living room in Iceland and sang it into my dictaphone. Later, by accident, we were going through sounds and I found this broken bottle sound. It wasn't intentional but it sounded great. It was one of the last songs recorded for Debut - the album was ready to go. Sometimes the more unpredictable side of me does several headstands and flicks-flacks once the album has been delivered and the best song come[s] out.\"   Björk played keyboards in the song: \"I don't use samplers much. I will usually gather soundbanks for each album and will then play them in on keyboards. This applies for simpler beats in songs like Venus as a Boy\". She is also responsible for the bassline, in an interview where she described her collaboration with Timbaland she said: \"He was a big fan of 'Venus as a Boy', the Bollywood strings and I remember him coming up to me at a party and saying he loved the bassline in that song and I felt pretty chuffed because I wrote that!\" Since Björk wanted the album to sound like an Indian soundtrack, many tracks including \"One Day\", \"Come to Me\" and the same \"Venus as a Boy\" features Indian instruments. The strings were recorded by a film studio orchestra in Bombay, thanks to Singh. The track heavily uses a vibraphone. The song also contains a sample from \"Music for Shō\" by Mayumi Miyata (1986).    Critical reception   \"Venus as a Boy\" received positive reviews from many music critics. For the Boys is a 1991 American musical comedy-drama film that traces the life of Dixie Leonard, a 1940s actress/singer who teams up with Eddie Sparks, a famous performer, to entertain American troops. The film was adapted by Marshall Brickman, Neal Jimenez, and Lindy Laub from a story by Jimenez and Laub. It was directed by Mark Rydell and the original music score was composed by Dave Grusin. It stars Bette Midler, James Caan, George Segal, Patrick O'Neal, Arye Gross, and Norman Fell. A then-unknown Vince Vaughn made his film debut as a cheering soldier in a crowd. As in The Rose, Midler's first starring role and also a large budget quasi-biopic, the film is fiction. However, actress and singer Martha Raye believed that Midler's character was based on many widely known facts about her life and career with the USO and pursued legal action based on that assumption. After a protracted legal engagement, Raye ultimately lost the case. The Caan character was generally believed to be based on Bob Hope. For her performance, Midler won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. The soundtrack features covers of many classic songs, including \"Come Rain or Come Shine\", \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" by Frank Loesser, \"P.S. I Love You\", \"I Remember You\" and the Beatles' \"In My Life\". Five of the 13 songs have lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The soundtrack's first single, \"Every Road Leads Back to You,\" was an original written by Diane Warren. Despite a mixed critical reception and box office failure, the film was adapted for the musical stage in 2011 by Aaron Thielen and Terry James and debuted at the Marriott Theatre in Lincolnshire, Illinois.    Plot  In the early 1990s, retired entertainer Dixie Leonard has a commitment to attend a Hollywood ceremony being televised live to honor her and her longtime show-biz partner Eddie Sparks. When a young man from the TV show comes to pick her up, Dixie balks and explains what brought Eddie and her together, as well as what drove them apart. The majority of the film is an extended flashback. Dixie's story begins during World War II when she receives an offer to entertain the troops overseas as part of Eddie's act. Dixie is an instant hit with the boys in uniform, but Eddie wants her gone, ostensibly because he finds her kind of humor too coarse, but in actuality because she stole the show by topping his jokes. Dixie doesn't care for him much, either, but fellow entertainers and her joke-writer uncle Art persuade her to stay. Eddie wins her over, particularly by reuniting Dixie with her soldier husband on stage. However, later in the war, Dixie's husband dies in battle. Despite her distaste for Eddie, Dixie continues working with him back in the States...mostly to support herself and her son Danny. Eddie is married with daughters, yet he becomes a proud surrogate father to Danny. As the Korean War breaks out, Eddie announces on stage that he and Dixie will be performing for the U.S. troops there, without having told Dixie of his plans first. In revenge, Dixie announces that Eddie made a $100,000 donation ($1,174,000 today) to the Red Cross. Reluctantly, she travels to Korea with him. On their way to the camp, they encounter a unit of soldiers that has been ambushed. Dixie cares for a wounded soldier but cannot save him: he is pronounced dead on arrival at the field hospital. Dixie and Eddie appear to spend the night together. At the Christmas dinner, a fight ensues after Art announces to everybody that Eddie has fired him for being a communist sympathizer. In the meantime, Danny has grown up to be a soldier like his father and is deployed to Vietnam. At Art's suggestion, Dixie eventually agrees to perform there for Christmas with Eddie. On their way to the camp, the performers are warned of the camp possibly being attacked, because of which they are to be flown out immediately after their performance. Before going on stage, Dixie and Eddie meet Danny, who reveals to them the barbarity that is spreading among his comrades. The show begins with the performance of a dancer, who starts getting harassed by the soldiers, and only Eddie's intervention prevents the situation from getting out of control. Dixie comes on stage and makes some cynical remarks about the soldiers, then sings “In My Life”. While she is still on stage, the camp is attacked in a mortar barrage. Dixie and Eddie find shelter, but Danny is killed right in front of them; both mourn deeply for him. Dixie has not forgiven Eddie for his part in all this, and they have another heated argument in the dressing room. Eddie goes out on stage alone. Robin Hood is a 1922 silent adventure film starring Douglas Fairbanks and Wallace Beery. It was the first motion picture ever to have a Hollywood premiere, held at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre on October 18, 1922. The movie's full title, under which it was copyrighted, is Douglas Fairbanks in Robin Hood. It was one of the most expensive films of the 1920s, with a budget estimated at one million dollars (equivalent to $18.2 million in 2023). The film was a smash hit and generally received favorable reviews.    Plot   The opening has the dashing Earl of Huntingdon besting his bitter enemy, Sir Guy of Gisbourne, in a joust. Huntingdon then joins King Richard the Lion-Hearted, who is going off to fight in the Crusades and has left his brother, Prince John, as regent. The prince soon emerges as a cruel, treacherous tyrant. Goaded on by Sir Guy, he usurps Richard's throne. When Huntingdon receives a message from Lady Marian Fitzwalter, his love interest, telling him of all that has transpired, he requests permission to return to England. King Richard assumes that the Earl has turned coward and denies him permission. The Earl seeks to leave in spite of this, but is ambushed by Sir Guy and imprisoned as a deserter. Upon escaping from his confines, he returns to England, endangering his life and honor, to oppose Prince John and restore King Richard's throne. He finds his friends and himself outlawed and Marian apparently dead. Huntingdon returns to Nottingham and adopts the name of Robin Hood, acrobatic champion of the oppressed. Leading a band that steals from the rich to give to the poor, including Friar Tuck, Little John, Will Scarlet, and Allan-a-Dale, he labors to set things right through swashbuckling feats and makes life miserable for Prince John and his cohort, the high sheriff of Nottingham. After rescuing Marian from Prince John's prison and defeating Sir Guy in a final conflict, Robin is captured. The timely reappearance of King Richard returns him to Marian and foils the efforts of Prince John.    Cast  Douglas Fairbanks as Earl of Huntingdon/Robin Hood (Fairbanks's custom was to place his name last.) Wallace Beery as King Richard the Lion-Hearted Sam De Grasse as Prince John Enid Bennett as Lady Marian Fitzwalter Paul Dickey as Sir Guy of Gisbourne William Lowery as The High Sheriff of Nottingham Willard Louis as Friar Tuck Alan Hale as The Squire/Little John Bud Geary as Will Scarlet Lloyd Talman as Allan-a-Dale Billie Bennett as Servant to Lady Marian Wallace Beery played King Richard the Lion-Hearted again the following year in a sequel called Richard the Lion-Hearted. Alan Hale, Sr., made such an impression as Little John in this film that he reprised the role 16 years later in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) opposite Errol Flynn, then played the character again in Rogues of Sherwood Forest in 1950, 28 years after his initial performance in the original Fairbanks film.    Production   A huge castle set and an entire 12th-century village of Nottingham were constructed at the Pickford-Fairbanks Studio in Hollywood. Some sets were designed by architect Lloyd Wright. Director Allan Dwan later recalled that Fairbanks was so overwhelmed by the scale of the sets that he considered cancelling production at one point. The castle was largely built of wood, wire, and plaster. The exceptions were the concrete floor and the (wood-covered) steel drawbridge. The story was adapted for the screen by Fairbanks (as \"Elton Thomas\"), Kenneth Davenport, Edward Knoblock, Allan Dwan, and Lotta Woods, and was produced by Fairbanks for his own production company, Douglas Fairbanks Pictures Corporation, and distributed by United Artists, a company owned by Fairbanks, his wife Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, and D. W. Griffith. This swashbuckling adventure was based on the legendary tale of the medieval hero, Robin Hood, and was the first production to present many of the elements of the legend that became familiar to movie audiences in later versions, although an earlier treatment had been filmed a decade before in the woods around Fort Lee, New Jersey, featuring even more flamboyant costumes than the Fairbanks version.    Score  At its premiere, Robin Hood was accompanied by an orchestral score especially commissioned by Fairbanks and composed by Victor Schertzinger. That score has also been adapted and conducted live by U.S. composer Gillian Anderson. A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game, or abbreviated as RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. There are several forms of role-playing games. The original form, sometimes called the tabletop role-playing game (TRPG or TTRPG), is conducted through discussion, whereas in live action role-playing (LARP), players physically perform their characters' actions. In both of these forms, an arranger called a game master (GM) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used, while acting as the referee; each of the other players takes on the role of a single character. Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media, such as multiplayer text-based Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) and their graphics-based successors, massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). Role-playing games also include single-player role-playing video games in which players control a character, or team of characters, who undertake(s) quests and may include player capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics. These electronic games sometimes share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs, but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling. This type of game is well-established, so some RPG-related game forms, such as trading/collectible card games (CCGs) and wargames, may not be included under the definition. Some amount of role-playing activity may be present in such games, but it is not the primary focus. The term role-playing game is also sometimes used to describe games involving roleplay simulation and exercises used in teaching, training, and academic research.    Purpose   Both authors and major publishers of tabletop role-playing games consider them to be a form of interactive and collaborative storytelling. Events, characters, and narrative structure give a sense of a narrative experience, and the game need not have a strongly-defined storyline. Interactivity is the crucial difference between role-playing games and traditional fiction. Whereas a viewer of a television show is a passive observer, a player in a role-playing game makes choices that affect the story. Such role-playing games extend an older tradition of storytelling games where a small party of friends collaborate to create a story. While simple forms of role-playing exist in traditional children's games of make believe, role-playing games add a level of sophistication and persistence to this basic idea with additions such as game facilitators and rules of interaction. Participants in a role-playing game will generate specific characters and an ongoing plot. A consistent system of rules and a more or less realistic campaign setting in games aids suspension of disbelief. The level of realism in games ranges from just enough internal consistency to set up a believable story or credible challenge up to full-blown simulations of real-world processes. Tabletop role-playing games may also be used in therapy settings to help individuals develop behavioral, social, and even language skills. Beneficiaries commonly include young people with neurodevelopmental conditions, such as Autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), and dyslexia.    Varieties  Role-playing games are played in a wide variety of formats, ranging from discussing character interaction in tabletop form, physically acting out characters in LARP to playing characters virtually in digital media. There is also a great variety of systems of rules and game settings. Games that emphasize plot and character interaction over game mechanics and combat sometimes prefer the name storytelling game. These types of games tend to reduce or eliminate the use of dice and other randomizing elements. Some games are played with characters created before the game by the GM, rather than those created by the players. This type of game is typically played at gaming conventions, or in standalone games that do not form part of a campaign.    Tabletop   Tabletop and pen-and-paper (PnP) RPGs are conducted through discussion in a small social gathering. The GM describes the game world and its inhabitants. The other players describe the intended actions of their characters, and the GM describes the outcomes. Some outcomes are determined by the game system, and some are chosen by the GM. This is the format in which role-playing games were first popularized. The first commercially available RPG, Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), was inspired by fantasy literature and the wargaming hobby and was published in 1974. The popularity of D&D led to the birth of the tabletop role-playing game industry, which publishes games with many different themes, rules, and styles of play. The popularity of tabletop games has decreased since the modern releases of online MMO RPGs. This format is often referred to simply as a role-playing game. \"The Mighty Casey\" is episode thirty-five of the American television anthology series The Twilight Zone. Its title is a reference to the baseball poem \"Casey at the Bat\". It originally aired on June 17, 1960, on CBS. The episode was written by Rod Serling, and directed by Robert Parrish and Alvin Ganzer.    Opening narration  What you're looking at is a ghost, once alive but now deceased. Once upon a time, it was a baseball stadium that housed a major league ball club known as the Hoboken Zephyrs. Now it houses nothing but memories and a wind that stirs in the high grass of what was once an outfield, a wind that sometimes bears a faint, ghostly resemblance to the roar of a crowd that once sat here. We're back in time now, when the Hoboken Zephyrs were still a part of the National League, and this mausoleum of memories was an honest-to-Pete stadium. But since this is strictly a story of make believe, it has to start this way: once upon a time, in Hoboken, New Jersey, it was tryout day. And though he's not yet on the field, you're about to meet a most unusual fella, a left-handed pitcher named Casey.    Plot  \"Mouth\" McGarry, the manager of a broken-down baseball team called the Hoboken Zephyrs on its last legs, is introduced to Dr. Stillman, an inventor who built a robot named Casey to play on the team. Casey has the ability to throw super-fast balls, super-slow balls, and extreme curveballs that cannot be hit. Eventually, after Casey is beaned by a ball and given a physical examination, the National League finds out and rules that Casey must be taken off the team because he is not human. Dr. Stillman then installs an artificial heart for Casey. However, due to his new heart, Casey now possesses human emotions. He refuses to throw his fast balls anymore, saying that he feels empathy with the batter and does not want to ruin the batter's career by striking him out, and quits baseball to become a social worker. With the team sure to fold soon, Dr. Stillman gives McGarry Casey's blueprints as a souvenir. Glancing at them, McGarry suddenly has an idea, and runs after Dr. Stillman to tell him. Rumors later surface intimating that McGarry has used the blueprints to build a world-champion team of Casey robots.    Closing narration  Once upon a time, there was a major league baseball team called the Hoboken Zephyrs, who, during the last year of their existence, wound up in last place and shortly thererafter wound up in oblivion. There's a rumor, unsubstantiated, of course, that a manager named McGarry took them to the West Coast and wound up with several pennants and a couple of world championships. This team had a pitching staff that made history. Of course, none of them smiled very much, but it happens to be a fact that they pitched like nothing human. And if you're interested as to where these gentlemen came from, you might check under 'B' for Baseball - in The Twilight Zone.    Production  According to The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic by Martin Grams, the entire production was originally filmed with Paul Douglas in the manager role. (Douglas previously played a baseball team manager in the 1951 film Angels in the Outfield.)  On Friday, September 11, 1959, the day after the episode finished shooting, Douglas died. Douglas had been, unbeknownst to anyone, suffering from an incipient coronary during the production; his performance was adversely affected, as on film, Douglas appeared mottled and out-of-breath. Writer and executive producer Rod Serling felt that the circumstances of Douglas' death cast a pall over what was supposed to be a light-hearted comedic episode, and decided that a re-shoot was necessary. CBS refused to finance any re-shooting, so consequently, virtually the entire production was reshot at the expense of Rod Serling's Cayuga Productions with Jack Warden in the team manager's role. The other roles were not recast, and as much footage from the original filming was used as possible, including (in the episode's final shot) a scene in which Douglas is seen in the distance, with his back to the camera, as the manager. Down Below may refer to: Leslie Parrish (born Marjorie Hellen; March 13, 1935) is an American actress, activist, environmentalist, writer, and producer. She worked under her birth name for six years before changing it in 1959.    Early life  As a child, Parrish lived in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey. At the age of 10, her family finally settled in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania. At the age of 14, Parrish was a talented and promising piano and composition student at the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music. At the age of 16, Parrish earned money for her tuition by working as a maid and a waitress, and by teaching piano. At the age of 18, to earn enough money to continue her education at the Conservatory, her mother persuaded her to become a model for one year.    Modeling and acting  In April 1954, as a 19-year-old model with the Conover Agency in New York City, Parrish was under contract to NBC-TV as \"Miss Color TV\" (she was used during broadcasts as a human test pattern to check accuracy of skin tones). She was quickly discovered and signed with Twentieth Century Fox in Hollywood. In 1956, she was put under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Because acting allowed her to help her family financially, she remained in Hollywood and gave up her career in music.    Films and television   Parrish co-starred/guest-starred in numerous films and television shows throughout the 1960s and 1970s.  She gained wide attention in her first starring role as Daisy Mae in the movie version of Li'l Abner (1959), where she changed her name from Marjorie Hellen to Leslie Parrish at the director's request. She appeared in the film The Manchurian Candidate (1962), playing Laurence Harvey's on-screen fiancée, Jocelyn Jordan.  Other film credits include starring opposite Kirk Douglas in For Love or Money (1963) and Jerry Lewis in Three on a Couch (1966), among others. Parrish amassed an extensive résumé of television credits. Among many other credits, Parrish appeared in guest starring roles on episodes of The Wild Wild West, My Three Sons, Perry Mason, Family Affair, Bat Masterson, The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Adam-12, Good Morning World, Police Story, Batman and McCloud. In 1967, she guest-starred on the Star Trek episode \"Who Mourns for Adonais?\", portraying Lt. Carolyn Palamas, the love interest of the character Apollo. In February 1968, she played opposite Peter Breck in the episode \"A Bounty on a Barkley\" of The Big Valley. The following month, Parrish made her first guest appearance on Mannix in the episode \"The Girl in the Frame\". Parrish served as associate producer on the film version of Jonathan Livingston Seagull (1973). Among other things, she hired the director of photography Jack Couffer – who later received an Academy Award nomination for his efforts – and she was responsible for the care of the film's real-life seagulls, which she kept inside a room at a Holiday Inn in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California for the duration of the shoot. When the relationship between author Richard Bach and director Hall Bartlett disintegrated and a lawsuit followed, Parrish was appointed as the mediator between the two men, but the meditation failed. Ultimately, the film was released in theaters with Bach's name taken off the screenwriting credits, while Bartlett demoted Parrish's credit in the finished film from associate producer to researcher. In 1975, Parrish appeared in the low budget B-Movie The Giant Spider Invasion which is now regarded as a cult film. While acting provided financial stability, her main interest was in social causes including the anti-war and civil rights movements and, as far back as the mid 1950s, the environment.    Political activism  Parrish's interests and activities in social movements and politics grew to become her main work. She was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War, a member of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade, a group of notable women who fought against the war and for civil rights. In June 1967, the then-32-year-old Parrish participated in a peace march in the Century City district of Los Angeles, where she and thousands of other protestors were attacked and beaten by the LAPD and the National Guard. President Lyndon Johnson was present at the Century Plaza Hotel and helicopters were flying overhead with machine guns pointed at the marchers. Parrish started to make speeches in the Los Angeles area, telling residents what the media did not report and speaking out against the war. A role-playing video game, role-playing game (RPG) or computer role-playing game (CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world, usually involving some form of character development by way of recording statistics. Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games and use much of the same terminology, settings, and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replay value and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences.    Characteristics  Role-playing video games use much of the same terminology, settings and game mechanics as early tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. Players control a central game character, or multiple game characters, usually called a party, and attain victory by completing a series of quests or reaching the conclusion of a central storyline. Players explore a game world, while solving puzzles and engaging in combat. A key feature of the genre is that characters grow in power and abilities, and characters are typically designed by the player. RPGs rarely challenge a player's physical coordination or reaction time, with the exception of action role-playing games. Role-playing video games typically rely on a highly developed story and setting, which is divided into a number of quests. Players control one or several characters by issuing commands, which are performed by the character at an effectiveness determined by that character's numeric attributes. Often these attributes increase each time a character gains a level, and a character's level goes up each time the player accumulates a certain amount of experience. Role-playing video games also typically attempt to offer more complex and dynamic character interaction than what is found in other video game genres. This usually involves additional focus on the artificial intelligence and scripted behavior of computer-controlled non-player characters.    Story and setting   The premise of many role-playing games tasks the player with saving the world, or whichever level of society is threatened. There are often twists and turns as the story progresses, such as the surprise appearance of estranged relatives, or enemies who become friends or vice versa. The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction (i.e. fantasy or science fiction), which allows players to do things they cannot do in real life and helps players suspend their disbelief about the rapid character growth. To a lesser extent, settings closer to the present day or near future are possible. The story often provides much of the entertainment in the game. Because these games have strong storylines, they can often make effective use of recorded dialog and voiceover narration. Players of these games tend to appreciate long cutscenes more than players of faster action games. While most games advance the plot when the player defeats an enemy or completes a level, role-playing games often progress the plot based on other important decisions. For example, a player may make the decision to join a guild, thus triggering a progression in the storyline that is usually irreversible. New elements in the story may also be triggered by mere arrival in an area, rather than completing a specific challenge. The plot is usually divided so that each game location is an opportunity to reveal a new chapter in the story. Pen-and-paper role-playing games typically involve a player called the gamemaster (or GM for short) who can dynamically create the story, setting, and rules, and react to a player's choices. In role-playing video games, the computer performs the function of the gamemaster. This offers the player a smaller set of possible actions, since computers can't engage in imaginative acting comparable to a skilled human gamemaster. In exchange, the typical role-playing video game may have storyline branches, user interfaces, and stylized cutscenes and gameplay to offer a more direct storytelling mechanism. Characterization of non-player characters in video games is often handled using a dialog tree. Saying the right things to the right non-player characters will elicit useful information for the player, and may even result in other rewards such as items or experience, as well as opening up possible storyline branches. Multiplayer online role-playing games can offer an exception to this contrast by allowing human interaction among multiple players and in some cases enabling a player to perform the role of a gamemaster.    Exploration and quests   Exploring the world is an important aspect of many RPGs. Players will walk through, talking to non-player characters, picking up objects, and avoiding traps. Some games such as NetHack, Diablo, and the FATE series randomize the structure of individual levels, increasing the game's variety and replay value. Role-playing games where players complete quests by exploring randomly generated dungeons and which include permadeath are called roguelikes, named after the 1980 video game Rogue. The game's story is often mapped onto exploration, where each chapter of the story is mapped onto a different location.

Helen Virginia Parrish (March 12, 1923 – February 22, 1959) was an American stage and film actress.\n\n\n== Career ==\nParrish was born in Columbus, Georgia. She started in movies at the age of 4, getting her first part playing Babe Ruth's daughter in the silent film Babe Comes Home in 1927. She was featured in the Our Gang comedy shorts and sometimes played the lead character as a child, co-starring with some of the great female stars of the day.  In her teens she made herself known as a kid sister.  During this time she also starred opposite Deanna Durbin in several of her films, playing a jealous, spiteful rival.  \nTheir first film together, Mad About Music (1938), worked so well that they soon formed a sort of Shirley Temple/Jane Withers team in a couple of other movie confections for Universal. In their second film together, Three Smart Girls Grow Up (1939), Parrish replaced Barbara Read as sister Kay Craig. Her films included X Marks the Spot (1931), When a Feller Needs a Friend (1932), A Dog of Flanders (1935), Little Tough Guy (1938), I'm Nobody's Sweetheart Now (1940), You'll Find Out (1940), Too Many Blondes (1941), X Marks the Spot (1942; a remake of her earlier film), Mystery of the 13th Guest (1943) and The Wolf Hunters (1949).\nBy her mid-twenties she had left motion pictures and turned to television, co-hosting Hour Glass, the first U.S. network variety show in 1946-47. In an era when \"... it was a social 'taboo' for a pregnant woman to display herself in public,\" Parrish was forced to leave Hour Glass as a result of her pregnancy. In 1953, she was host of It's a Good Idea and This Is Your Music.\nOne notable TV role was that of Geraldine Rutherford in the first season of the American television situation comedy Leave It to Beaver.\nHer last role on television was as women's editor of a morning program, Panorama Pacific, on the West Coast.\nParrish appeared in TV commercials for a variety of products throughout the 1950s, earning more income from them than from roles in shows. In 1955, she said that making commercials \"turned out to be the next best thing to owning an oil well.\"\n\n\n== Family ==\nHer brother, Robert Parrish, was a minor child actor who earned respect as a film editor and director and her sister, Beverly Parrish, died suddenly at the age of 11 after filming only one movie.\nOn July 11, 1942, Parrish married actor Charles G. Lang, Jr. in Hollywood. They had a son and a daughter, then divorced in 1954. On August 3, 1956, she married television producer John Guedel. She had a miscarriage in April 1958.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nParrish has a star at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard in the Motion Pictures section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was dedicated on February 8, 1960.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn February 22, 1959, Parrish died of cancer at Presbyterian Hospital in Hollywood. She is buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\n\n\n== Partial filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nWillson, Dixie. Little Hollywood Stars.

Participants determine the actions of their characters based on their characterization, and the actions succeed or fail according to a set formal system of rules and guidelines, usually containing Dice-Rolling. Within the rules, players have the freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the game. The terms pen-and-paper and tabletop are generally only used to distinguish this format of RPG from other formats, since neither pen and paper nor a table are strictly necessary, though are usually used. Some common examples of tabletop role-playing games include Dungeons & Dragons, Call of Cthulhu, Pathfinder, and Vampire: The Masquerade.    Gameplay     Overview  In most games, a specially designated player typically called the game master (GM) purchases or prepares a set of rules and a fictional setting in which each player acts out the role of a single character. The GM describes the game world and its inhabitants; the other players describe the intended actions of their characters, and the GM describes the outcomes. Some outcomes are determined by the game system, and some are chosen by the GM. This pattern was established by the first published role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons, but is not universal across all tabletop RPGs.    Detail  Games are of indefinite length, from a single brief session (sometimes completed in a few hours) to a series of repeated sessions that may continue for years with an evolving cast of players and characters. Play is often episodic and mission-centric, with a series of challenges culminating in a final puzzle or enemy that must be overcome. Multiple missions played with the same characters may be related to each other in a plot arc of escalating challenges. The exact tone, structure, pace and end (if any) vary from game to game depending on the needs and preferences of the players. During the first session, players typically create characters whose roles they will play in the game. As well as fleshing out the character's personal history and background, they assign numerical statistics to the character; these will be used later to determine the outcome of events in the game. Together, these notes tell the player about their character and said character's place in the game world. In many game systems, characters can increase their statistics during the course of the game (or over multiple games).  The GM then begins the game by introducing and describing the setting and the characters. Specific tabletop RPGs may have a unique name for the GM role, for examples: Dungeon Master, Referee and Storyteller. Some games, such as Polaris and Primetime Adventures, have distributed the authority of the GM to different players and to different degrees. This technique is often used to ensure that all players are involved in producing a situation that is interesting and that conflicts of interest suffered by the GM are avoided on a systemic level. The players describe their characters' actions, and the GM responds by describing the outcome of those actions. Usually, these outcomes are determined by the setting and the GM's common sense; most actions are straightforward and immediately successful. For example, if a player has their character look around a room, the GM will describe the room; if they have their character leave, the GM will describe whatever they encounter outside the room. The outcomes of some actions are determined by the rules of the game. For example, while looking around the room, a character may or may not notice an important object or secret doorway, depending on the character's powers of perception. Determining the outcome usually involves rolling dice and adjusting the result for the character's statistics and environmental factors to see whether the action was successful. Typically, the higher the character's score in a particular attribute, the higher their probability of success. There are alternate game systems which are diceless, or use alternate forms of randomization, such as a deck of cards or a Jenga tower. Tabletop RPG settings includes challenges for the player characters to overcome through play, such as traps to be avoided, rulers to be courted, or adversaries to be fought. Many game sessions contain moments of puzzle solving, negotiation, chases, and combat. Frequently, this involves interacting with non-player characters, other denizens of the game world, which are played by the GM. In most games, the full details of the setting are kept secret, but some broad details of the game world are usually given to the players. Tabletop RPGs are often conducted like radio drama: only the spoken component of a role is acted. Acting in tabletop RPGs is not always literal, and players do not always speak exclusively in-character. The Windscale fire of 10 October 1957 was the worst nuclear accident in the United Kingdom's history, and one of the worst in the world, ranked in severity at level 5 out of 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale. The fire was in Unit 1 of the two-pile Windscale site on the north-west coast of England in Cumberland (now Sellafield, Cumbria). The two graphite-moderated reactors, referred to at the time as \"piles\", had been built as part of the British post-war atomic bomb project. Windscale Pile No. 1 was operational in October 1950, followed by Pile No. 2 in June 1951. The fire burned for three days and released radioactive fallout which spread across the UK and the rest of Europe. The radioactive isotope iodine-131, which may lead to cancer of the thyroid, was of particular concern at the time. It has since come to light that small but significant amounts of the highly dangerous radioactive isotope polonium-210 were also released. It is estimated that the radiation leak may have caused 240 additional cancer cases, with 100 to 240 of these being fatal. At the time of the incident, no one was evacuated from the surrounding area, but milk from about 500 km2 (190 square miles) of the nearby countryside was diluted and destroyed for about a month due to concerns about its radiation exposure. The UK government played down the events at the time, and reports on the fire were subject to heavy censorship, as Prime Minister Harold Macmillan feared the incident would harm British-American nuclear relations. The event was not an isolated incident; there had been a series of radioactive discharges from the piles in the years leading up to the accident. In early 1957, there had been a leak of radioactive material in which strontium-90 was released into the environment. Like the later fire, this incident was covered up by the British government. Later studies on the release of radioactive material due to the Windscale fire revealed that much of the contamination had resulted from such radiation leaks before the fire. A 2010 study of workers involved in the cleanup of the accident found no significant long-term health effects from their involvement.    Background  The December 1938 discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann following its prediction by Ida Noddack in 1934 – and its explanation and naming by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch – raised the possibility that an extremely powerful atomic bomb could be created. During the Second World War, Frisch and Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham calculated the critical mass of a metallic sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that as little as 1 to 10 kilograms (2.2 to 22.0 lb) might explode with the power of thousands of tons of dynamite. In response, the British government initiated an atomic-bomb project, codenamed Tube Alloys. The August 1943 Quebec Agreement merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project. As overall head of the British contribution to the Manhattan Project, James Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership with the Americans, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted. After the war ended, the Special Relationship between Britain and the United States \"became very much less special\". The British government had assumed that America would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered a joint discovery, but little information was exchanged immediately after the war. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) officially ended technical cooperation. Its control of \"restricted data\" prevented the United States' allies from receiving any information. The British government saw this as a resurgence of United States isolationism akin to that which had occurred after the First World War. This raised the possibility that Britain might have to fight an aggressor alone. It also feared that Britain might lose its great power status, and therefore its influence in world affairs. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee, set up a cabinet sub-committee, the Gen 75 Committee (known informally as the \"Atomic Bomb Committee\"), on 10 August 1945 to examine the feasibility of a renewed nuclear weapons programme. The Tube Alloys Directorate was transferred from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to the Ministry of Supply on 1 November 1945, and Lord Portal was appointed Controller of Production, Atomic Energy (CPAE), with direct access to the Prime Minister. An Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) was established at RAF Harwell, south of Oxford, under the directorship of John Cockcroft. Christopher Hinton agreed to oversee the design, construction and operation of the new nuclear weapons facilities, which included a uranium metal plant at Springfields in Lancashire, and nuclear reactors and plutonium processing facilities at Windscale in Cumbria.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Raju. It is a remake of the 1942 Telugu film of the same name.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins with Queen Bhulakshmi, wife of King Nava Bhoja, penances Shiva for progeny. Ultimately, she acquires the boon, and according to the Lord's mandate, she procures a fruit from the tree by stepping on an anthill. At this, enraged Nagendra is about to kill her, but she begs for life until her motherhood. After a while, Bhulakshmi is blessed with seven daughters and decides to repent. Anyhow, Nava Bhoja bars and attempts to shield her but gets a victim of a snake bite and dies. Now, the King coercively knits a shrew, Manikyamba, who oppress the kids. Plus, she molds Nava Bhoja, a henpecked husband, via a witchcraft paste and goads him to slaughter the girls. Generous father cannot make it, so he quits them in the forest, where the Bhulakshmi aura rears them. \nYears pass, and King Ramavardhi, the ruler of Panuganti, is the sibling of Bhulakshmi, who sends his seven sons to detect his niece. Whereat, the younger Karyavardhi, spots the last girl, Balanagamma, and they crush. Now, the seven sisters' splices, their cousins, Karyavardhi & Balanagamma, are blessed with a baby boy, Balavardhi. Besides, Mayala Marathi,  the splenetic wizard, resides on the outskirts of his ghost den. Once, he challenges his paramour Sangu to nab a gorgeous in the universe and picks Balanagamma. At the same time, Karyavardhi proceeds to the battlefield, drawing a chalk outline for protection and designating his acolyte, Thalari Ramudu, as a guard. However, Marathi's chicanery abducts Balanagamma by transforming her into a dog. Knowing it, Karyavardhi onslaughts with his men on Marathi, whom he turns as the status and even incinerates Sangu. Spotting it, Balanagamma attempts suicide, and Bhulakshmi's aura secures her, stating that her son will safeguard her at the age of 12. Hereupon, Balanagamma tactically resisted Marathi for 12 years. \nAs time passes, Balavardhi learns about Marathi's atrocity. Ergo pledges to relieve his parents and steps in with Thalari Ramudu. Amid this, he shields a kingdom from a tiger hunt and conjoins its princess. Following, seeking guidance from Nagendra, Balavardhi intrudes into Marathi's palace through a florist, Tambala Pedi. He is acquainted with his mother and, with wit, extracts the life secret of Marathi, i.e., amalgamated beyond the seven seas; one pillar is the floor and in the parrot's neck. Balavardhi acquires it after an adventurous journey. At last, he ceases Marathi, making his father & family normal. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note with a family reunion.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nBala Nagamma was remade from the 1942 film of the same name.

It encompasses machine ethics and AI alignment, which aim to ensure AI systems are moral and beneficial, as well as monitoring AI systems for risks and enhancing their reliability. The field is particularly concerned with existential risks posed by advanced AI models. Beyond technical research, AI safety involves developing norms and policies that promote safety. It gained significant popularity in 2023, with rapid progress in generative AI and public concerns voiced by researchers and CEOs about potential dangers. During the 2023 AI Safety Summit, the United States and the United Kingdom both established their own AI Safety Institute. However, researchers have expressed concern that AI safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of AI capabilities.    Motivations  Scholars discuss current risks from critical systems failures, bias, and AI-enabled surveillance, as well as emerging risks like technological unemployment, digital manipulation, weaponization, AI-enabled cyberattacks and bioterrorism. They also discuss speculative risks from losing control of future artificial general intelligence (AGI) agents, or from AI enabling perpetually stable dictatorships.    Existential safety   Some have criticized concerns about AGI, such as Andrew Ng who compared them in 2015 to \"worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet yet\". Stuart J. Russell on the other side urges caution, arguing that \"it is better to anticipate human ingenuity than to underestimate it\". AI researchers have widely differing opinions about the severity and primary sources of risk posed by AI technology – though surveys suggest that experts take high consequence risks seriously. In two surveys of AI researchers, the median respondent was optimistic about AI overall, but placed a 5% probability on an \"extremely bad (e.g. human extinction)\" outcome of advanced AI. In a 2022 survey of the natural language processing community, 37% agreed or weakly agreed that it is plausible that AI decisions could lead to a catastrophe that is \"at least as bad as an all-out nuclear war\".     History  Risks from AI began to be seriously discussed at the start of the computer age:  Moreover, if we move in the direction of making machines which learn and whose behavior is modified by experience, we must face the fact that every degree of independence we give the machine is a degree of possible defiance of our wishes. From 2008 to 2009, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) commissioned a study to explore and address potential long-term societal influences of AI research and development. The panel was generally skeptical of the radical views expressed by science-fiction authors but agreed that \"additional research would be valuable on methods for understanding and verifying the range of behaviors of complex computational systems to minimize unexpected outcomes\". In 2011, Roman Yampolskiy introduced the term \"AI safety engineering\" at the Philosophy and Theory of Artificial Intelligence conference, listing prior failures of AI systems and arguing that \"the frequency and seriousness of such events will steadily increase as AIs become more capable\". In 2014, philosopher Nick Bostrom published the book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. He has the opinion that the rise of AGI has the potential to create various societal issues, ranging from the displacement of the workforce by AI, manipulation of political and military structures, to even the possibility of human extinction. His argument that future advanced systems may pose a threat to human existence prompted Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking to voice similar concerns. In 2015, dozens of artificial intelligence experts signed an open letter on artificial intelligence calling for research on the societal impacts of AI and outlining concrete directions. To date, the letter has been signed by over 8000 people including Yann LeCun, Shane Legg, Yoshua Bengio, and Stuart Russell. In the same year, a group of academics led by professor Stuart Russell founded the Center for Human-Compatible AI at the University of California Berkeley and the Future of Life Institute awarded $6.5 million in grants for research aimed at \"ensuring artificial intelligence (AI) remains safe, ethical and beneficial\". In 2016, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and Carnegie Mellon University announced The Public Workshop on Safety and Control for Artificial Intelligence, which was one of a sequence of four White House workshops aimed at investigating \"the advantages and drawbacks\" of AI. In the same year, Concrete Problems in AI Safety – one of the first and most influential technical AI Safety agendas – was published. In 2017, the Future of Life Institute sponsored the Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI, where more than 100 thought leaders formulated principles for beneficial AI including \"Race Avoidance: Teams developing AI systems should actively cooperate to avoid corner-cutting on safety standards\". In 2018, the DeepMind Safety team outlined AI safety problems in specification, robustness, and assurance.

Shah Alam II became the emperor of a crumbling Mughal Empire. His power was so depleted during his reign that it led to a saying in the Persian language, Sultanat-e-Shah Alam, Az Dilli ta Palam, meaning, 'The empire of Shah Alam is from Delhi to Palam', Palam being a suburb of Delhi. Shah Alam faced many invasions, mainly by the Emir of Afghanistan, Ahmed Shah Abdali, which led to the Third Battle of Panipat (1761) between the Maratha Confederacy, and the Afghan Empire led by Abdali. In 1760, the invading forces of Abdali were driven away by the Marathas, led by Sadashivrao Bhau, who deposed Shah Jahan III, the puppet Mughal emperor of Imad-ul-Mulk, and installed Shah Alam II as the rightful emperor (1760 – 1772). Shah Alam II was considered the only and rightful emperor, but he was unable to return to Delhi until 1772, under the protection of the Maratha general Mahadaji Shinde. He also fought against the East India Company at the Battle of Buxar (1764).  In 1788, when he was a prisoner of Ghulam Qadir, he was blinded. Shah Alam II authored his own Diwan of poems and was known by the pen-name Aftab. His poems were guided, compiled and collected by Mirza Fakhir Makin. Shah Alam also penned the famous book Ajaib-ul-Qasas, which is considered one of the earliest and most prominent books of prose in Urdu.    Early life  Ali Gohar was born to Shahzada (Prince) Aziz-ud-Din, son of the deposed Mughal Emperor Jahandar Shah, on 25 June 1728. Alongside his father, he grew up in semi-captivity in the Salatin quarters of the Red Fort. However, unlike the majority of Mughal princes growing up in similar circumstances, he is not recorded to have become a decadent prince by the time his father became emperor, and therefore was naturally given high appointments in the course of his father's reign. Upon his father's accession, he became the Wali al-Ahd (Crown Prince) of the empire, and became his father's principal agent, though almost all power lay in the Wazir Imad-ul-Mulk's hand. His quarrels with that amir, and fear for his own life, caused him to flee from Delhi in 1758.    Escape from Delhi  Prince Ali Gauhar, afterwards Emperor Shah Alam II, had been the heir apparent of his father Alamgir II. Prince Ali Gauhar's father had been appointed Mughal Emperor by Vizier Imad-ul-Mulk and Maratha Peshwa's cousin Sadashivrao Bhau. Prince Ali Gauhar organized a militia and made a daring escape from Delhi. He appeared in the Eastern Subah in 1759, hoping to strengthen his position by attempting to regain control over Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. Very soon however, Najib-ud-Daula forced the usurper Imad-ul-Mulk to flee from the capital by gathering a large Mughal Army outside Delhi. He used the army to depose the recreant Shah Jahan III. Najib-ud-Daula and Muslim nobles then planned to defeat the Marathas by maintaining correspondence with the powerful Ahmad Shah Durrani. After Durrani decisively defeated the Marathas, he nominated Ali Gauhar as the emperor under the name Shah Alam II.    Bengal War  In 1760, after Shah Alam's militia gaining control over pockets in Bengal, Bihar and parts of Odisha, Prince Ali Gauhar and his Mughal Army of 30,000 intended to overthrow Mir Jafar and Imad-ul-Mulk after they tried to capture or kill him by advancing towards Awadh and Patna in 1759. But the conflict soon involved the intervention of the assertive East India Company. The Mughals clearly intended to recapture their breakaway Eastern Subah led by Prince Ali Gauhar, who was accompanied by a Militia consisting of persons like Muhammad Quli Khan, Kadim Husein, Kamgar Khan, Hidayat Ali, Mir Afzal and Ghulam Husain Tabatabai. Mirza Khujista Akhtar Jahan Shah (Persian: میرزا خجسته اختر جهان شاه) (4 October 1673 – 30 March 1712/30) was the fourth son of Emperor Bahadur Shah I. The birthdate of Mirza Khujista Akhtar Jahan Shah is debated, according to his found memoir his death date is now set on 1730. Both dates are correct otherwise then.\n\n\n== Life ==\nHe was made Subahdar of Malwa (1707–1712) and raised to an Imperial Mansab of 30,000 Zat and 20,000 Sawar. After his father's death, he sided with his brother Mu'izz-ud-Din and defeated his other brother, Azim-ush-Shan in 1712. But Mu'izz-ud-Din disagreed with him over the distribution of the Imperial treasury and fought a battle against him in which he was supposed to be killed along with his eldest son Farkhunda Akhtar. His youngest son Muhammad Shah later ruled as emperor for 28 years.\n\n\n== Family ==\nOne of his wives was Zakiyat-un-nissa Begum, the daughter of Prince Muhammad Akbar. He had married her at Agra in 1695, at the same time his brother Rafi-ul-qadr married her sister Raziyat-un-nissa Begum. Another was Fakhr-un-nissa Begum, the descendant of Sarih Qazi, and the mother of Emperor Muhammad Shah. She died on 16 May 1733, aged about sixty years. Another of his wives was Nek Munzir, who died at Delhi, on 27 April 1744.\nJahan Shah had 5 spouses from whom he had 5 sons and 8 daughters. His five sons are as Muhammad Shah, Buland Akhtar Mirza Bahadur, Mubarak Akhtar Mirza Bahadur, Muhammad Humayun Mirza Akhtar and Shahzada Farkhunda Akhtar. \n\n\n== References ==\nThe Mughal Empire by John F. Richards\n\n\n== Notes == \" Where Was I?\" may refer to: Mirza Shah Abbas Bahadur (1845 – 25 December 1910) was son of the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. He was a younger brother of Prince Mirza Mughal and former Crown Princes Mirza Dara Bakht, Mirza Jawan Bakht, and Mirza Fath-ul-Mulk Bahadur.\n\n\n== Sources == The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place. Sayed Kayan or Sayed of Kayan is a ruling title in northern areas of Afghanistan. Ismaili community in Afghanistan is led by this family of Syeds hailing from the historical valley of Kayan Baghlan.    Historical Background   Kayan is a valley in Dushi district of Baghlan province, situated in northern Afghanistan, having 27000 km2 Ismaili fiefdom. The forefathers of these Sayeds mostly resided in this valley, making them known as the Kayani Sayeds. Nothing is known about their origin except that Sayed Nadir Khan writes in \"Tarikh-i Gharib\" (Bombay, 1938) that his forefather, Shah Salih came from Iran to Herat and Kandahar. He then proceeded towards Hazarajat and settled at last in the province of Baghalan. Granted that this tradition is genuine, it means that it was most probably the period of Imam Gharib Mirza (d. 1496). When these Sayeds settled in Afghanistan, the Safavids had captured whole Iran in 1500 A.D. and proclaimed Shiism as state religion. This despotic and bigoted dynasty ordered the merciless slaughter of the Sunnis and Sufis in Iran. Most of them migrated towards Afghanistan including this noble family of Sayeds. They never collected religious dues in Afghanistan nor imposed their headships on religious ground during the early period of their settlement. There was a minor group of Hindu residing in Kabul, who professed Ismailism secretly. They however practiced taqiya and hid themselves in the mantles of the Hindus. The local Ismailis in Afghanistan were the only people to know their faith and link with the Imam. The Afghan Ismailis collected the tithe and delivered to them, who remitted it to the Imam in Iran. According to the narration of Sayed Nadir Khan, \"About 120 years ago, our forefathers were under Bairam Diyal and his fathers and they were the Hindus living in Kabul. Their descendants also are in Kabul and our ancestors delivered their oblations to them in Kabul.\" At a later stage, Imam Hasan Ali Shah Aga Khan I sent a special message through Mukhi Aziz to the descendants of the above Ismailis in Kabul to wear Muslim costumes and adopt Islamic names. Their Mukhi Fakir Chand responded the call of the Imam at first. He exposed publicly and assumed the name of Faqir Muhammad. But his people embodied very small group, missed a chance to divulge their Islamic identity as the Ismailis. On the other hand, at that time there was not a single Ismaili center in Afghanistan to perform their rites and ceremonies freely even within the walls, therefore, the above small group kept aloof from the Ismaili tradition and assimilated in Hindu community. Some old persons among them however remained firm in their belief and continued to send their tithe in Kabul Jamatkhana. The Sayeds of Kayan led the Afghan Jamats as local rulers for a long period. The first among them was Sayed Abdul Hadi, who in his advanced age had made a trip of Mahallat Iran from Kabul. Imam Hasan Ali Shah Aga Khan I appointed him as the mukhi of Central and Northern parts of Afghanistan during the reign of Dost Muhammad Khan (1826–1863). He was considered an influential lord in the royal court of Dost Muhammad Khan. He was the first mukhi in Afghanistan, who administered the offices of Dai and Khalifa. His son Shah Hussain succeeded him. Nothing is known about the early life of Shah Hussain or his services as a mukhi. Sayed Nadir Khan is also silent in his \"Tarikh-i Gharib\" on the subject. He was however the first among the Afghan jamat to see Imam Hasan Ali Shah Aga Khan I at Kandahar in 1842 when he was on his journey to relocate from Iran to India. He died in 1854 and left behind seven sons, two of them were appointed as the mukhi, viz. Sayed Jafar Khan and Sayed Gawhar Khan. The next who followed was Sayed Jafar Khan, who served as a mukhi for 40 years. He was an influential figure during the regime of Sher Ali Khan (1863–1886). The tradition has it that once Imam Hasan Ali Shah Aga Khan I sent four Arabian horses as a gift to Sher Ali Khan, Emir of Afghanistan through Sayed Jafar Khan and Mirza Ahmed. Sher Ali Khan kept the horses in Kataghan for breeding. The people of Kataghan still remember the race of the horses as Barnaj and Barata. He died in 1894 and his younger brother, Sayed Gawhar Khan succeeded him. Gawhar Khan is related to have been appointed by Imam Agha Ali Shah Aga Khan II. Zafar Mahal, in Mehrauli village, in South Delhi, India, is considered as the last monumental structure built as a summer palace during the fading years of the Mughal era. The building has two components namely, the Mahal or the palace, which was built first by Akbar Shah II in the 18th century, and the entrance gate that was reconstructed in the 19th century by Bahadur Shah Zafar II, popularly known as \"Zafar\" (the nom de plume of Bahadur Shah II) meaning ‘Victory’. It has a forlorn history because Bahadur Shah Zafar, who wished to be buried in the precincts of the Zafar Mahal (palace) and the famous Dargah of Khwaja Qutubuddin Bakhtiar Kaki in Mehrauli, Delhi, was deported by the British to Rangoon, after the First War of Indian Independence in 1857, where he died of old age. The monument today is in a neglected and ruined state, locals play cricket and gamble freely inside the protected monument. The 18th-century palace has been all but subsumed by unauthorised constructions.    History  Zafar Mahal, is the ruined summer palace of the last Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar II. The Moghul dynasty, which started with the first Mughal Emperor Babur who conquered Delhi in 1526 AD ended after 332 years when on 7 October 1858 the last Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar II (1837–1857) was tried for treason by the British and deported to Rangoon, Burma, now Myanmar from the imperial city of Delhi. The irony of this history is also that he travelled in a bullock cart, with a group of British Lancers escorting him.  The graves in Mehrauli in the precincts of Zafar Mahal, built within a marble screen enclosure by Jahandar Shah for his father Bahadur Shah I and others who followed, is a minor reflection of the history of the place. Shah Alam II who had the misfortune of being blinded by Ghulam Qadir, the Rohilla leader was buried here. He was considered a \"puppet ruler\", first under the Marathas and later under the British. His son Akbar Shah II was also buried here. Mirza Fakruddin son of the last emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, who died early ushered the end of the Moghul regime, was also buried here. But Bahadur Shah Zafar who had identified the location for his grave (sardgha – the vacant land for burial) was the most unfortunate (ill-fated) as he was deported to Rangoon and was buried there. The exiled emperor died in November 1862. He was buried with great urgency in the night itself with \"lantern light\" in presence of his few family members under the direction of a British officer. The grave was initially unmarked but later a Tablet was erected at the location but only in the 20th century. His mazar (grave) has at last become a shrine and the local Burmese and also visitors from India and Pakistan consider him a Pir (saint). It is also said that the nationalist leader of India, founder of the Indian National Army, Subhas Chandra Bose took a formal oath at this grave to free India from foreign rule.    Structure   The palace, located at about 300 feet (91 m) to the west of Ajmeri Gate of the dargah of Khwaja Kaki has an imposing gate. It was built in 1842 by Akbar Shah II. Built as a three-storied structure in red sandstone embellished with marble, it is around 50 feet (15 m) wide with a gate opening called the Hathi gate (built to allow full decorated elephants with the howdah to pass through) is of 11.75 feet (4 m) opening at the entrance. An inscription on the main arch credits building of the gate (as an entry gate to the existing Mahal) by Bahadur Shah II in the eleventh year of his accession as Emperor in 1847-48 AD. A broad Chhajja (cantilevered projection) built in the Mughal style is a striking feature of the arch. At the entrance gate, the logo has small projecting windows flanked by curved and covered Bengali domes. On both sides of the arch, two ornate medallions in the form of large lotuses have been provided. The gateway also depicts a classic tripolia or three-arch opening into the baaraadaree or 12 opening structure, which fully draws the breeze. Mirza Faiz Muhammad, also known by his title of Azādud Daulah, was an Indian nobleman and official in the Mughal empire during the 18th century. He was a descendant of Mirza Hadi Baig and the great- great grandfather of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian. Zeenat Mahal (1823 – 17 July 1886) was the only wife and de facto regent of the Mughal Kingdom on behalf of her husband, the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZeenat Mahal married Bahadur Shah II at Delhi on 19 November 1840 and had a son with him, Mirza Jawan Bakht.\nShe greatly influenced the emperor and, after the death of crown prince Mirza Dara Bakht, she began promoting her son Mirza Jawan Bakht as heir to the throne over the Emperor's remaining eldest son Mirza Fath-ul-Mulk Bahadur. But due to the primogeniture policy of the British, this was not accepted. She was suspected of poisoning the British Resident in Delhi, Thomas Metcalfe, in 1853 for meddling too much in palace affairs.\nShe resided at her own haveli, Zeenat Mahal, in Lal Kuan, old Delhi.\n\n\n=== 1857 rebellion ===\n\nDuring the Indian rebellion of 1857, she kept her son out of contact with the rebels in an attempt to secure the throne for him. With the British victory, the emperor's two other sons were shot for supporting the rebels; however, her son did not become heir. In 1858, her husband was deposed by the British, bringing the Mughal empire to an end, and she was exiled to Rangoon with her husband. After her husband's death in 1862, the British banned anyone from claiming the title of Emperor in an attempt to dissolve the monarchy.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nShe died on 17 July 1886. Another source says that she \"died more than 20 years after her husband.\" She was buried in her husband's tomb in Yangon's Dagon Township near the Shwedagon Pagoda. The site later became known as Bahadur Shah Zafar Dargah.\nThe grandchild of her and Bahadur Shah II is also buried alongside the couple. After remaining lost for many decades, the tomb was discovered during a restoration exercise in 1991.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nZeenat-un-Nissa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Zinat Mahal at Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe Prime Minister at Bahadur Shah Zafar's Dargah (Video) at CNN-IBN, May 30, 2012. Malik Muhammad khan — was second khan of Baku and a son of Mirza Muhammad Khan. Irshad mirza is an Indian industrialist and the executive chairman of mirza Farrukhsiyar (Persian pronunciation: [faɾ.ˈɾux saj.ˈjɑːɾ]; 20 August 1683 – 9 April 1719), also spelled as Farrukh Siyar, was the tenth Mughal Emperor from 1713 to 1719. He rose to the throne after deposing his uncle Jahandar Shah. He was an emperor only in name, with all effective power in the hands of the courtier Sayyid brothers. He was born during the reign of his great-grandfather Aurangzeb, Reportedly a handsome man who was easily swayed by his advisers, he was said to lack the ability, knowledge and character to rule independently. Farrukhsiyar was the son of Azim-ush-Shan, the second son of emperor Bahadur Shah I and Sahiba Niswan.    Ancestry     Early life  Muhammad Farrukhsiyar was born on 20 August 1683 (9th Ramzan 1094 AH) in the city of Aurangabad on the Deccan plateau, to a Kashmiri mother, Sahiba Niswan. He was the second son of Azim-ush-Shan, the Grand son of emperor Bahadur Shah I and a great grandson of emperor Aurangzeb. In 1696, Farrukhsiyar accompanied his father on his campaign to Bengal. Aurangzeb recalled Azim-ush-Shan from Bengal in 1707 and instructed Farrukhsiyar to take charge of the province. Farrukhsiyar spent his early years governing Dhaka (in present-day Bangladesh) the capital city of Bengal Subah. In 1712 Azim-ush-Shan anticipated Bahadur Shah I's death and a struggle for power, and recalled Farrukhsiyar. He was marching past Azimabad (present-day Patna, Bihar, India) when he learned of the Mughal emperor's death. On 21 March, Farrukhsiyar proclaimed his father's accession to the throne, issued coinage in his name and ordered khutba (public prayer). On 6 April, he learned of his father's defeat to an alliance orchestrated by Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung between Jahandar Shah, and his younger brothers Rafi-us-Shan and Jahan Shah. Although the prince considered suicide, he was dissuaded by his friends from Bengal.    Deposing Jahandar Shah   In 1712, Jahandar Shah (Farrukhsiyar's uncle) ascended the throne of the Mughal Empire by defeating Farrukhsiyar's father, Azim-ush-Shan. Farrukhsiyar wanted revenge for his father's death and was joined by Hussain Ali Khan (the subahdar of Bengal) and Abdullah Khan, his brother and the subahdar of Allahabad. When they reached Allahabad from Azimabad, Jahandar Shah's military general Syed Abdul Ghaffar Khan Gardezi and 12,000 troops clashed with Abdullah Khan, resulting in Abdullah retreating to the Allahabad Fort. However, Gardezi's army fled when they learned about his death. After the defeat, Jahandar Shah sent general Khwaja Ahsan Khan and his son Aazuddin. When they reached Khajwah (present-day Fatehpur district, Uttar Pradesh, India), they learned that Farrukhsiyar was accompanied by Hussain Ali Khan and Abdullah Khan. With Abdullah Khan commanding the vanguard, Farrukhsiyar began the attack. After a night-long artillery fight, Aazuddin and Khwaja Ahsan Khan fled and the camp fell to Farrukhsiyar. On 10 January 1713, Farrukhsiyar and Jahandar Shah's forces met at Samugarh, 14 kilometres (9 mi) east of Agra in present-day Uttar Pradesh. Jahandar Shah was defeated and imprisoned, and the following day Farrukhsiyar proclaimed himself the Mughal emperor. On 12 February, Farrukhsiyar marched to the Mughal capital of Delhi, capturing the Red Fort and the citadel. Jahandar Shah's head, mounted on a bamboo rod, was carried by an executioner on an elephant and his body was carried by another elephant.    Reign     Hostility towards the Sayyid Brothers   Farrukhsiyar defeated Jahandar Shah with the aid of the Sayyid brothers, and one of the brothers, Abdullah Khan, wanted the post of wazir (prime minister). His demand was rejected, since the post was promised to Ghaziuddin Khan, but Farrukhsiyar offered him a post as regent under the name of wakil-e-mutlaq. Mirza Mehdy Ispahani( also known as Sadri Ispahani)( 1923–2004), son of Mirza Ahmad Ispahani, was Chairman of M.M. Ispahani from 1949 till 2004. Mirza Ali Behrouze Ispahani, son of Mirza Mehdy Ispahani was elected as the Chairman of M.M. Ispahani in 2004. Mirza Gul Muhammad( d. 1800) was an Indian military official in the Mughal Empire and the independent chief of Qadian. He was the grandfather of Mirza Ghulam Murtaza who was the father of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Shahzada Mirza Sultan Muhammad Farkhunda Shah (?–June 1842\n) also known Mirza Bulaqi Sahib was a son of Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah II.  Bahadur Shah Zafar or Bahadur Shah II  (born as Mirza Abu Zafar Siraj-ud-din Muhammad) (24 October 1775 – 7 November 1862) was the last Mughal emperor. He was the second son of and became the successor to his father, Akbar II, upon his death on 28 September 1837. He was a nominal Emperor, as the Mughal Empire existed in name only and his authority was limited only to the walled city of Old Delhi (Shahjahanbad). Following his involvement in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British exiled him to Rangoon in British-controlled Burma (now in Myanmar), after convicting him on several charges. Zafar's father, Akbar II had been imprisoned by the British and he was not his father's preferred choice as his successor. One of Akbar Shah's queens, Mumtaz Begum, pressured him to declare her son, Mirza Jahangir, as his successor. However, The East India Company exiled Jahangir after he attacked their resident, in the Red Fort, paving the way for Zafar to assume the throne. Bahadur Shah II (born Mirza Abu Zafar Siraj-ud-din Muhammad (24 October 1775 – 7 November 1862), usually referred to by his poetic title Bahadur Shah Zafar (Persian pronunciation: [ba.hɑː.ˈduɾ ʃɑːh za.ˈfaɾ]; Zafar lit. 'Victory'), was the twentieth and last Mughal emperor and a Hindustani poet. He was the second son and the successor to his father, Akbar II, who died in 1837. He was a titular Emperor, as the Mughal Empire existed in name only and his authority was limited only to the walled city of Old Delhi (Shahjahanbad). Following his involvement in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British deposed him and exiled him to Rangoon in British-controlled Burma in late 1858, after convicting him on several charges. The title of Empress of India was subsequently assumed by Queen Victoria. Bahadur Shah Zafar's father, Akbar II, had been imprisoned by the British and he was not his father's preferred choice as his successor. One of Akbar Shah's queens  pressured him to declare her son, Mirza Jahangir, as his successor. However, the East India Company exiled Jahangir after he attacked their resident in the Red Fort, paving the way for Bahadur Shah to assume the throne.    Reign   Bahadur Shah Zafar ruled over a Mughal Empire that had by the early 19th century been reduced to only the city of Delhi and the surrounding territory as far as Palam. The Maratha Empire had brought an end to the Mughal Empire in the Deccan during the 18th century and the regions of India formerly under Mughal rule had either been absorbed by the Marathas or had declared independence and become smaller kingdoms. The Marathas installed Shah Alam II in the throne in 1772, under the protection of the Maratha general Mahadaji Shinde and maintained suzerainty over Mughal affairs in Delhi. The East India Company became the dominant political and military power in mid-nineteenth century India. Outside the region controlled by the company, hundreds of kingdoms and principalities fragmented their land. The emperor was respected by the company, who provided him with a pension. The emperor permitted the company to collect taxes from Delhi and maintain a military force in it. Zafar never had any interest in statecraft or had any \"imperial ambition\". After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British exiled him from Delhi. Bahadur Shah Zafar was a noted Urdu poet, having written a number of Urdu ghazals. While some part of his opus was lost or destroyed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a large collection did survive, and was compiled into the Kulliyyat-i-Zafar. The court that he maintained was home to several renowned Urdu scholars, poets and writers including Mirza Ghalib, Daagh Dehlvi, Momin Khan Momin, and Mohammad Ibrahim Zauq (who was also Bahadur Shah Zafar's mentor). After Zafar's defeat, he said:    1857 Rebellion  As the Indian Rebellion of 1857 spread, Sepoy regiments reached the Mughal Court at Delhi. Because of Zafar's neutral views on religions, many Indian kings and regiments accepted and declared him as the Emperor of India. On 12 May 1857, Zafar held his first formal audience in several years. It was attended by several sepoys who were described as treating him \"familiarly or disrespectfully\". When the sepoys first arrived at Bahadur Shah Zafar's court, he asked them why they had come to him, because he had no means of maintaining them. Bahadur Shah Zafar's conduct was indecisive. However, he yielded to the demands of the sepoys when he was told that they would not be able to win against the East India Company without him. On 16 May, sepoys and palace servants killed fifty-two Europeans who were prisoners of the palace and who were discovered hiding in the city. The executions took place under a peepul tree in front of the palace, despite Zafar's protests. The aim of the executioners who were not the supporters of Zafar was to implicate him in the killings. Once he had joined them, Bahadur Shah II took ownership for all the actions of the mutineers. Though dismayed by the looting and disorder, he gave his public support to the rebellion. Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group. Motherland may also refer to: The location of the grave of Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal emperor at Yangon, Myanmar is in dispute.  He was buried at the back of his enclosure, but by 1903 the location of his grave was forgotten. After some protests, the British were forced to construct a stone slab to mark the site of his grave. The location of his burial was once again found in 1991, when excavators found the skeleton of the last Mughal emperor there. A mausoleum was constructed and inaugurated in 1994.    Death  When Zafar reached the age of 87 in 1862, he was \"weak and feeble.\" In late October 1862, his health condition deteriorated suddenly. The British Commissioner, H.N. Davies, wrote that his future was \"very uncertain.\" He was \"spoon-fed on broth,\" but even found that difficult by the beginning of November. On November 6, Davies recorded that Zafar \"is evidently sinking from pure desuetude and paralysis in the region of his throat.\" To prepare for the king's death, Davies ordered a collection of lime and bricks to be built, and a spot was selected at the \"back of Zafar's enclosure\" for his burial. Zafar eventually died on November 7, 1862, at 5 a.m. He was buried at 4 p.m. on the same day \"at the rear of the Main Guard in a brick grave covered over with turf level with the ground,\" according to Davies. The ceremony was attended by his two children and their servant but not Zafar's wife, Zinat Mahal. Davies recorded that \"[a] bamboo face surrounds the grave for some considerable distance and by the time the fence is worn out the grass will again have properly covered the spot [...] [N]o vestige will remain to distinguish where the last of the Great Moghuls rests.\" He also said that his death did not have any effect  on the people of Rangoon, except for some Muslims who paid their tribute to the \"final triumph of Islam.\"    Burying of Zinat Mahal and Jawan Bakht   Zafar's wife, Zinat Mahal, died in 1882 approximately 20 years after his death. When she died, the location of Zafar's grave had already been forgotten and \"could not be located,\" so she was buried in a roughly similar position near a tree where his grave was assumed to be. Zafar's son, Mirza Jawan Bakht, died two years later and was also buried at the same site.    1903 visitors and protest  In 1903, a group of visitors came from India to pay tribute to Zafar at his burial place. But at that time \"even the exact location of Zinat Mahal's grave had been forgotten though some local guides pointed out the sight of the withered lotus tree.\" In 1905, the Muslims of Rangoon protested and demanded that there should be some measure to demarcate Zafar's grave because \"...As a man or as a king, Bahadur Shah was not to be admired, but he should be remembered.\" They wanted the government to buy a \"strip of land enclosing the grave in question, of sufficient area to permit a monument worthy of Bahadur Shah erected over it.\" This notion was forwarded by the British to Calcutta and the reply was that it was \"inappropriate for the Government\" to construct \"anything\" over the remains of Zafar as a tomb \"which might become a place of pilgrimage.\" This was followed by demonstrations and a \"long series of newspaper articles\" by which the British agreed in 1907 to erect a single stone slab in which it was engraved \"Bahadur Shah, ex-King of Delhi died at Rangoon November 7th, 1862 and was buried near this spot.\" The Rangoon Times of 26 August 1907 reported that a meeting would be held at the Victoria Hall to \"record a sense of satisfaction among the Mohammedan community for the erection of the present memorial.\" Later that year, a memorial stone devoted to Zinat Mahal was added. Zafar's granddaughter, Raunaq Zamani, was also buried nearby. Though the spot was lost, people knew that Zafar was buried somewhat south of Shwedagon Pagoda.    Dargah   The railing was made into a makeshift stone by 1925 which was covered with corrugated iron. According to the Myanmar Times, the British wanted the tomb to be \"lost and forgotten, and hoped to leave no trace that could allow the body to be identified.\" In February 1991, workers who were digging for a drain discovered a \"brick lined tomb.\" On top of it was an inscription and soon the body's identity was found.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

It was begun in 1855 and worked on until 1864. Dadd painted it while incarcerated in the State Criminal Lunatic Asylum of Bethlem Royal Hospital, where he was confined after he murdered his father in 1843. It was commissioned by George Henry Haydon, who was head steward of the hospital at the time.    History  Dadd had begun his career as a painter of fairy paintings before the onset of his mental illness. After he was committed, he was encouraged to resume painting. G. H. Haydon was impressed by Dadd's artistic efforts and asked for a fairy painting of his own. Dadd worked on the painting for nine years, paying microscopic attention to detail and using a layering technique to produce 3D-like results. Although it is generally regarded as his most important work, Dadd himself considered the painting to be unfinished (the background of the lower left corner is only sketched in).  He signed the back of the canvas with the inscription: \"The Fairy-Feller's Master-Stroke, Painted for G. H. Haydon Esqre by Rd. Dadd quasi 1855–64\". According to Patricia Allderidge, 'quasi' \"may mean that it was set aside during that period or that it took a long time to start\". The end date, 1864, coincides with Dadd's transfer to Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire, the asylum where he spent the remaining 21 years of his life. In order to give context to his work, Dadd subsequently wrote a long poem by the name of Elimination of a Picture & its Subject—called The Fellers' Master Stroke in which each of the characters appearing in the picture is given a name and purpose—including myriad references to old English folklore and Shakespeare—in an apparent attempt to show that the painting's unique composition was not merely a product of random, wild inspiration. From Haydon the painting passed to collector Alfred Morrison, whose daughter Katharine Gatty gave it to the war poet Siegfried Sassoon when he married her daughter Hester in 1933. Sassoon withdrew it from a  Sotheby's auction on 29 May 1963 and presented it to the Tate Gallery \"in memory of his friend and fellow officer Julian Dadd, a grandnephew of the artist, and of his [Julian's] two brothers [Stephen Gabriel and Edmund] who gave their lives in the First World War\". Julian Dadd was severely wounded in the war and died by suicide in 1937. The painting is now in the Tate Britain collection. In 1998 it was included in the exhibition Victorian Fairy Painting at the Frick Museum in New York City.    In other works   The Queen song \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\" from the album Queen II was born of Freddie Mercury's appreciation of the work; it makes direct reference to the painting's characters as detailed in Dadd's poem. Terry Pratchett's novel The Wee Free Men contains a scene inspired by the painting. The painting, the art of the insane, and Dadd are mentioned in the novel, Mortal Love, by Elizabeth Hand. The work is a central plot element in the novel The Witches of Chiswick by Robert Rankin. Neil Gaiman wrote a tribute to the painting for the July/August edition of Intelligent Life magazine. The painting appears in Alex Bledsoe's Tufa novels. Former Gorky's Zygotic Mynci singer Euros Childs included an instrumental song titled \"The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke\" on his 2009 solo album, Son of Euro Child. Mark Chadbourn's \"The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke\", about a contemporary young man looking for meanings in the painting, won the British Fantasy Award for best short story in 2003. Octavio Paz devoted a chapter on Richard Dadd and this painting in particular in his book The Monkey Grammarian. The Throbs album The Language of Thieves and Vagabonds cover art has fragments of the painting (Geffen Records, 1991). The penultimate issue of Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comics is titled after the painting and includes a sequence featuring the life of Dadd, who is depicted as being trapped in the painting following his death. The song “Dancing in the Temple”, by Swedish heavy metal band Candlemass is \"inspired by Richard Dadd’s fantastic painting “The Fairy Feller’s Master Stroke” that [the band's bassist] Leif [Edling] saw at [the] Tate Gallery. Mr Edling and Freddie Mercury…what a pair!\"    References     Bibliography  Allderidge, Patricia (1974). Richard Dadd. New York and London: St. The butterfly (shortened to fly) is a swimming stroke swum on the chest, with both arms moving symmetrically, accompanied by the butterfly kick (also known as the \"dolphin kick\") along with the movement of the hips and chest. It is the newest swimming style swum in competition, first swum in the early 1930s and originating out of the breaststroke.    Speed and ergonomics  The butterfly stroke boasts a higher peak velocity than the front crawl, owing to the synchronous propulsion generated by the simultaneous pull/push of both arms and legs. However, due to the pronounced drop in speed during the recovery phase, it is marginally slower than the front crawl, especially over extended distances. Furthermore, the butterfly stroke demands a different level of physical exertion, contributing to its slower overall pace than the front crawl.  \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t    History     Origins of the butterfly kick  The earliest mention of the butterfly kick can be attributed to George Corsan, who, according to the International Swimming Hall of Fame introduced it by demonstration to David Armbruster in 1911. Corsan called it a \"fishtail kick\". A perhaps independent discovery of the fishtail kick was made by Volney Wilson some time before 1938, Wilson was a young physicist and swimmer who had analyzed the motions of swimming fish. Another discovery of the butterfly kick was made by Jack Sieg, who, while being watched by David Armbruster, went underwater, lay on his side and performed the butterfly kick in imitation of a fish. Armbruster was reminded of the time in 1911 when George Corsan had previously demonstrated it to him, and noticed the speed that Sieg was able to achieve. Armbruster got Sieg to demonstrate it on his front, and Sieg was even faster. Sieg was even able to beat the best flutter kickers at the University of Iowa using the fishtail kick. Initially, Corsan and Armbruster thought that the \"fishtail kick\" could be a possible alternative to the flutter kick in freestyle, but in 1933 it began to dawn on Armbruster that it would perhaps be more effective in breaststroke. Armbruster began to experiment with Sieg on using the butterfly kick in breaststroke and had excellent results. Presumably to reflect this, he also began referring to the previously named \"fishtail kick\" as the \"dolphin breaststroke kick\". He published his results in 1935 in an article called \"The Dolphin Breast Stroke\" in The Journal of Health and Physical Education where, due to its potential to be faster than the traditional whip kick, Armbruster was enthusiastic to have it legalized within the breaststroke rules, to \"offer this new type of stroke for exploitation as a competitive racing-speed stroke\". Armbruster followed this appeal with another longer article in the 1937 NCAA Swimming and Diving Guide called \"The New Dolphin Breast Stroke on Trial\", which further urged the NCAA to allow the kick in the rules for the extra speed. Unfortunately for Armbruster, this would not come to fruition, as in a FINA meeting in October 1938, the bureau unanimously agreed to prohibit up-and-down movements of the legs in the vertical plane.    Origins of the butterfly arm  Prior to 1935, the breaststroke rules from both FINA and the NCAA stated that the arms had to be simultaneously pushed forward on recovery. Since the rules did not state that the arm recovery had to be underwater, a few swimmers came up with the idea of an overarm recovery, which was initially called the \"flying fish\". The International Swimming Hall of Fame credits Sydney Cavill with creating the overarm recovery, but it is also possible that Erich Rademacher independently discovered it in 1927 Germany. Rademacher generally used the flying fish coming out of the turns, which was dubbed the \"flying breaststroke turn\" and at the end of the race, which was dubbed the \"flying finish\". Rademacher insisted that this did not break the rules, and continued to use it in the late 1920s and early 1930s in the US. Sources conflict as to whether he used it in the 1928 Olympics, with the International Swimming Hall of Fame saying he did but Francois Oppenheim's book \"The History of Swimming\" saying he didn't. In 1935, presumably for the removal of ambiguity, the NCAA changed the rule regarding the breaststroke recovery to use the word \"moved\", rather than \"pushed\". Other early adoptees of the \"flying breaststroke turn\" were Walter Spence and then Wallace Spence, who went on to dominate the breaststroke events using it. Queen II is the second studio album by the British rock band Queen. It was released on 8 March 1974 by EMI Records in the UK and  Elektra Records in the US. It was recorded at Trident Studios and Langham 1 Studios, London, in August 1973 with co-producers Roy Thomas Baker and Robin Geoffrey Cable, and engineered by Mike Stone. It is significant for being the first album to contain elements of the band's signature sound of multi-layered overdubs, vocal harmonies, and varied musical styles. Described as \"arguably the heaviest Queen album\", Queen II marked the end of the first phase of the band's career. The album combines a heavy rock sound with art rock and progressive rock elements, and has been called \"a pillar of grandiose, assaultive hard rock\" by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Queen II is not a concept album but a collection of songs with a loose theme running throughout. The two sides of the original LP were labelled \"Side White\" and \"Side Black\" (instead of the conventional sides A and B), with corresponding photos of the band dressed in black on the front cover and white on the inner gatefold. The white side has songs with a more emotional theme and the black side is almost entirely about fantasy, often with quite dark themes. Mick Rock's cover photograph was frequently re-used by the band throughout its career, including the music videos for the songs \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" (1975) and \"One Vision\" (1985). Released to an initially mixed critical reception, Queen II remains one of the band's lesser-known albums. Nonetheless, it has retained a cult following since its release, and garnered praise from critics, fans, and fellow musicians alike.    Background and recording   Queen performed their first gig on 27 June 1970, but did not finish their self-titled debut album, Queen, until November 1972. In the interim, the band had developed other, more complex material but elected to wait to record it until they had more freedom and experience in the studio. \"Father To Son\", \"Ogre Battle\" and \"Procession\" had all been premiered as early as 1972. \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" dated to Freddie Mercury's Wreckage days in 1969. \"See What a Fool I've Been\", the B-side to the \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" single and \"White Queen (As It Began)\" were left over from the Smile days. \"Stone Cold Crazy\", also from Mercury's Wreckage period, had been in the set list for years, but was held back and reworked for the third album, Sheer Heart Attack. Portions of \"The Prophet's Song\" were also rehearsed during the Queen II sessions, but the song was not completed until the fourth album, A Night at the Opera. Queen insisted that Trident Studios allow them to record at regular hours instead of studio down-time, as they had for the first album. The band approached David Bowie to produce, but he declined because he was then recording Pin Ups and working on songs for Diamond Dogs. Robin Geoffrey Cable, with whom Mercury had worked during the \"I Can Hear Music\" session, was asked to produce \"Nevermore\" and \"Funny How Love Is\", and collaborate with Roy Thomas Baker on the ambitious \"March of the Black Queen\". After the commercial failure of the single \"Keep Yourself Alive\" from the first album, Queen decided it needed a single that did not take \"too long to happen\" (i.e., without a lengthy guitar intro). \"Seven Seas of Rhye\", recorded with the specific intention of being the album's leading single, began in a way designed to grab attention. Rehearsals for the Queen II sessions commenced on or around 26 July. (Due to management problems, the first album was finally released as the band prepared to record Queen II.) During these rehearsals, the band were interviewed by Melody Maker and told the magazine that their new album would have a theme of \"good versus evil\". The band also ended its collaboration with John Anthony, who had co-produced the first album, due to clashes between Mercury and Anthony. On 3 August, the band performed at a gig in Newcastle, then returned to London for a pre-recording rehearsal on 4 August. Sessions began on 5 August with takes 1–12 of the finished version of \"Seven Seas of Rhye\". On 6 August, they started recording \"Father To Son\", working on takes 1–4. They continued to work on the album until 9 August, when they made promotional videos for \"Keep Yourself Alive\" and \"Liar\" from the debut album. According to the August 11 issue of Record Mirror, the band was scheduled to go back into the studio on 15 August. However, David Bowie and Ken Scott were producing Pin Ups in the studio Queen had been using.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Early life  Frankie Laine was born Francesco Paolo LoVecchio on March 30, 1913, to Giovanni and Crescenzia LoVecchio (née Salerno). His Cook County, Illinois, birth certificate (No. 14436) was already Americanized at the time of his birth, with his name written as \"Frank Lovecchio\", his mother as \"Anna Salerno\", and his father as \"John Lovecchio\", with the \"V\" lower case in each instance, except in the \"Reported by\" section with \"John Lo Vecchio (father)\" written in. His parents had emigrated from Monreale, Sicily, to Chicago's Near West Side, in \"Little Italy\", where his father worked at one time as the personal barber for gangster Al Capone. Laine's family appears to have had several organized crime connections, and young Francesco was living with his grandfather when the latter was killed by rival gangsters. The eldest of eight children, Laine grew up in the Old Town neighborhood (first at 1446 N. North Park Avenue and later at 331 W. Schiller Street) and had his first taste of singing as a member of the choir in the Church of the Immaculate Conception's elementary school across the street from the North Park Avenue home. He later attended Lane Technical High School, where he helped to develop his lung power and breath control by joining the track and field and basketball teams. He realized he wanted to be a singer when he missed time in school to see Al Jolson's current talking picture, The Singing Fool. Jolson would later visit Laine when both were filming pictures in 1949, and, at about this time, Jolson remarked that Laine was going to put all the other singers out of business.    Early career and stylistic influences  Even in the 1920s, his vocal abilities were enough to get him noticed by a slightly older \"in crowd\" at his school, who began inviting him to parties and to local dance clubs, including Chicago's Merry Garden Ballroom. At 17, he sang before a crowd of 5,000 at The Merry Garden Ballroom to such applause that he ended up performing five encores on his first night. Laine was giving dance lessons for a charity ball at the Merry Garden when he was called to the bandstand to sing:  Soon I found myself on the main bandstand before this enormous crowd, Laine recalled. I was really nervous, but I started singing 'Beside an Open Fireplace,' a popular song of the day. It was a sentimental tune and the lyrics choked me up. When I got done, the tears were streaming down my cheeks and the ballroom became quiet. I was very nearsighted and couldn't see the audience. Frank Luhovy (April 16, 1943 – May 24, 2016), known as Cowboy Frankie Laine, was a Canadian professional wrestler.\n\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\nLaine wrestled throughout Canada, Puerto Rico, and various parts of the United States. His career started in 1966 as a baby face along with his valet Peggy Laine in Ontario and later in Alberta. Into the early-1970s he wrestled in California and headlined cards in Los Angeles against Goliath and Black Gordman. In the mid-to-late-1970s he was again in Alberta at Stampede Wrestling. Into 1980 he was in the Detroit and Toronto areas. As well he teamed with Dutch Mantel as heels in a bloody feud against Carlos Colon and Victor Jovica as Los Vaqueros Locos and helped sell out the Hiram Bithorn Stadium in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico for 13 weeks straight. In 1985 he worked as a prelim wrestler for the WWF losing to their main stars mostly on TV shows. Luhovy also worked as a promoter for WWE in London, Ontario.\n\n\n=== Post-retirement ===\nAfter retiring from wrestling, Laine ran his family's 700-acre farm in Alvinston, Ontario. When Owen Hart was accidentally killed in a wrestling stunt, Laine claimed that promoters' greed had led to Hart's death.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nLaine died in Petrolia, Ontario, on May 24, 2016, of multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\nContinental Wrestling Association\nNWA Mid-America Heavyweight Championship (1 time) \nMid-Pacific Promotions\nNWA Hawaii Heavyweight Championship (1 time) \nNWA Hollywood Wrestling\nNWA Americas Heavyweight Championship (1 time) \nPacific Northwest Wrestling\nNWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship (3 times) - with Moondog Mayne (1), Bobby Nichols (1) and Big Snuka (1).\nStampede Wrestling\nStampede North American Heavyweight Championship (2 times)\nStampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Les Thorton (1) \nWorld Wrestling Council\nNWA North American Tag Team Championship (Puerto Rico/WWC version) (3 times) - with Dutch Mantel (3) \n\n\n== References == \"I Believe\" is a popular song written by Ervin Drake, Irvin Abraham (as \"Irvin Graham\"), Jack Mendelsohn (as \"Jimmy Shirl\") and Al Stillman in 1953. The most popular version was recorded by Italian-American singer Frankie Laine, and spent eighteen weeks at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart.    Background  \"I Believe\" was commissioned and introduced by Jane Froman on her television show, and became the first hit song ever introduced on television. Froman, troubled by the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, asked Drake, Graham, Shirl and Stillman to compose a song that would offer hope and faith to the populace. Froman's commercial recording reached No. 11 in the Billboard charts during a 10-week stay. \"I Believe\" has been recorded by many others, and has become both a popular and religious standard.    Frankie Laine recording   Frankie Laine's original version was recorded for Columbia Records on 8 January 1953 at Radio Recorders in Hollywood. It featured Paul Weston and his Orchestra accompanying Laine. Laine's recording spent eighteen non-consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart. As of 2020, this record remains unbeaten. \"I Believe\" was the best-selling single of 1953 in the UK, spending 36 weeks on the chart. It entered the listings on 3 April 1953, and first reached No. 1 in its fourth week on chart, spending nine weeks at the top. On 26 June, it was replaced at No. 1 for a week by \"I'm Walking Behind You\" by Eddie Fisher featuring Sally Sweetland, but returned to the top spot on 3 July for another six weeks. On 14 August, it was again replaced at the top for a week, this time by Mantovani's \"Song From the Moulin Rouge\". On 21 August, \"I Believe\" returned to No. 1 for its final run at the top, for three weeks, bringing its total time at No. 1 to eighteen weeks. Laine also had the most successful version in the US, where his recording reached No. 2, staying there for three weeks. Laine would later re-record the song for other labels on a number of occasions. The first of these was on December 18, 1964 in Hollywood, with orchestra arranged and conducted by Ralph Carmichael. The recording was released on the Capitol album I Believe the following year. A recording made by Laine on February 25, 1970 for Amos Records in Hollywood, with orchestra arranged by Jimmie Haskell, was issued on the album Frankie Laine's Greatest Hits that year. In June 1977, with Pete Moore's Orchestra and Ray Barr on piano, Laine recorded \"I Believe\" for a fourth label. This version was included on the Polydor album 20 Memories in Gold, an album largely consisting of re-recordings of his earlier hits, which was released in September that year. In May 1980, Laine recorded \"I Believe\" at a session of his hit re-recordings used by K-Tel. The recordings were backed by an orchestra conducted by Don Jackson with The Worlettes, and released on the 1982 album The Music Of Frankie Laine. \"I Believe\" was also recorded as part of a different collection of Laine hit remakes in January 1982, again with the Don Jackson Orchestra. This album, The World Of Frankie Laine, was released by Ronco the same year. In all, Laine recorded \"I Believe\" for six different record companies over a period spanning from 1953 to 1982.    Contemporary chart performance and recordings  In the US, only the versions by Froman and Laine charted, whilst only Laine's charted in the UK. It was commonplace at the time for multiple artists to record versions of a new song, and others were released. In the UK, \"I Believe\" entered the sheet music sales chart on 11 April 1953, and reached No. 1 on 13 June, its tenth week on chart. It spent a week at the top, and returned on 24 October for another week, with a total of two weeks at No. 1 on the sheet music chart. The Frankie Laine version was the first to be issued in the UK, in February 1953. April saw recordings by Jane Froman, Ronnie Ronalde and David Whitfield. Subsequent releases were of versions by Eve Boswell, Allan Jones, Victor Silvester and his Ballroom Orchestra, and Ethel Smith (organ).

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When did the director of film The First Mass die?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nJosé Maria Barreto Bustíos (16 November 1875 – 11 August 1948) was a Peruvian diplomat in Switzerland who is best known for issuing passports to save Jews during World War II.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHis father, Federico María Barreto served as a colonel in the Peruvian army, while his brother was Federico Barreto, a poet. Barreto himself was known to be very reserved, so much so that his nickname was \"el lugubre\" (the gloomy).\nBarreto lived in Tacna during the Chilean occupation of Peru after the War of the Pacific. As a journalist, he advocated for the Peruvian identity of the territory through writing alongside his brother. In 1911, the Chilean government forced him to leave Tacna, so he moved to Lima and was appointed director of El Peruano. To avoid attracting unwanted attention, his works were published under pseudonyms such as Joseph Marius, René Tupic and Ramón Román.\nHe was a member of the Royal Academy of History and the Royal Geographical Academy of Madrid, The Academies of History and Geography of Brazil and Bolivia, and the International Law Association of Washington.\nHis diplomatic career began in 1925, being appointed as general secretary of the Peruvian delegation to Tacna and Arica, which were at the time under the control of Chile. He represented Peru in missions to Mexico, Bolivia, Venezuela, France, Panama, Germany and Switzerland, additionally serving in the Peruvian delegation to the League of Nations.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nIn 1938, while working as consul general the government of Peru ordered its consulates in Europe to not give visas to immigrants, singling out Jews. At the request of RELICO, Barreto started to give out passports to Jews in countries under Nazi rule. He later explained that he'd wanted to save human life and believed the Peruvian government would support him.\nIn 1943, Barreto was caught issuing a passport to a man named Gunther Frank, and when the Swiss authorities confronted him, he revealed he had given out passports to 58 Jews to stop them from being sent to concentration camps. After learning of this, the Peruvian foreign service fired Barreto and cancelled the visas.\nBarreto passed away five years later on 11 August 1948. He later was recognized as Righteous Among the Nations in 2014.\n\n\n== References == The term refers to the first occasion a Eucharistic celebration (a Mass) takes place. There are two natural contexts to its use:\n\nHistorical, which would be the first occasion where a Mass is celebrated in a particular place, such as the First Mass in the Philippines.\nPersonal, this term is used for the first occasion at which a newly ordained Catholic priest presides at a Mass. The term is also often used within the Anglican communion, particularly by Anglo-Catholics. While clearly a special moment in that man's life, particular blessings take place on this occasion. The term is likewise used in the Church of Sweden, with the same definition (the Latin term, Prima Missa, is most often used).\n\n\n== References == Thomas Scott( 1907- date of death unknown) was an English diver.

Mass Effect is a military science fiction media franchise created by Casey Hudson. The franchise depicts a distant future where humanity and several alien civilizations have colonized the galaxy using technology left behind by advanced precursor civilizations. The franchise originated in a series of video games developed by BioWare and originally published by Microsoft Game Studios on the first two games and its expansions. Later on, the series was taken over by Electronic Arts. Each installment is a third-person shooter with role-playing elements. The first three games form a trilogy in which the player character, Commander Shepard, attempts to save the Milky Way galaxy from a race of ancient, hibernating machines known as the Reapers. The inaugural video game in the series, Mass Effect (2007), follows Shepard's investigation of Saren Arterius, one of the Reapers' agents. Mass Effect 2 (2010) begins two years later and sees Shepard's forces battling the Collectors, an alien race abducting human colonies to facilitate the Reapers' return. The original trilogy's final installment, Mass Effect 3 (2012), depicts a war between the Reapers and the rest of the galaxy. A fourth game, Mass Effect: Andromeda (2017), featured a new setting and cast of characters, and a fifth is in active development. The original trilogy was met with commercial success as well as universal acclaim. Critics praised the game's narrative, characters, voice acting, world building, and emphasis on player choice. The ending of Mass Effect 3 drew widespread criticism for being an unsatisfying conclusion to the trilogy, prompting Electronic Arts to release an expanded cut with additional cutscenes. Mass Effect: Andromeda received mixed reviews. Praise was directed at the game's visuals and combat, but the game drew criticism for technical issues and its plot. The series has generated attention and discussion about its representation of same-sex relationships and sexual minorities. It also originated the dialogue wheel, a mechanic similar to dialogue trees, enabling players to dynamically steer conversations by selecting from a number of preset choices; the feature has seen widespread use in other role-playing video games. The success of the video game series spawned adaptations in other media, including novels, comics, and an animated film.    Setting   The Mass Effect original trilogy takes place in the Milky Way towards the end of the 22nd century. In 2148, humanity discovered an alien outpost on Mars, and learned that Charon is actually an alien artifact known as a \"mass relay\" that enables faster-than-light travel to other mass relays located across the galaxy. These discoveries drastically increased the enhancement rate of humanity's technology. Humanity comes into contact with numerous other space-faring alien species, some far more advanced than humans. Humanity's first encounter resulted in the First Contact War, but the Council, a ruling body for the galaxy, intervened to achieve peace and welcomed humanity. The main species encountered by humanity include the asari, a species of mono-gendered beings closely resembling human women; the salarians, an amphibious species with considerable technological and intellectual prowess and an extremely high metabolism; and the turians, a heavily militaristic race of raptor-like avian humanoids who fought humanity in the First Contact War. The center of the Council's governing power is the Citadel, another artifact and a massive space station that, like the mass relays, were made by a race known as the Protheans believed to be the progenitor race for all species but long since disappeared. Over the next few decades, humanity is given access to new technology, allowing them to colonize new planets, and they are made part of the Citadel Security (C-Sec) forces, a highly regarded position that other species had been long waiting for and take resentment over. Numerous other inter-species conflicts remain active at the time of the first game, results of past wars and conflicts. The first three games center on the character of Commander Shepard (whose gender and personality are determined by the player), a leading Special Forces soldier in Earth's Systems Alliance space force, the Systems Alliance Navy. After an Earth colony discovers a new Prothean artifact, it is attacked by an unknown vessel, and the Council names Shepard its first human SPECTRE (Special Tactics and Reconnaissance), an elite agent with associated authority and impunity, to investigate the incident. Shepard comes in contact with the artifact and has a vision of war and death across the galaxy. Following their vision, Shepard discovers that the strange craft is one of thousands of artificial lifeforms called Reapers, and learns that every fifty-thousand years, the Reapers scour the Milky Way and eliminate all higher forms of life, leaving the younger species to advance and thrive until the next cycle as to prevent constant war and chaos, part of what the Protheans had left behind along with their artifacts. The First Mass  is a 1961 Brazilian drama film directed by Lima Barreto, based on Nair Lacerda's short story \"Nhá Colaquinha Cheia de Graça\".

A mass shooting is a violent crime in which one or more attackers kill or injure multiple individuals simultaneously using a firearm. There is no widely accepted definition of \"mass shooting\", and different organizations tracking such incidents use different criteria. Mass shootings are often characterized by the indiscriminate targeting of victims in a non-combat setting, and thus the term generally excludes gang violence, shootouts and warfare. Mass shootings may be done for personal and psychological reasons, but have also been used as a terrorist tactic. The perpetrator of an ongoing mass shooting may be referred to as an active shooter.  In the United States, the country with the most mass shootings, the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012 defines mass killings as three or more killings in a single incident. A Congressional Research Service report from 2013 specifies four or more killings on indiscriminate victims while excluding violence committed as a means to an end, such as robbery or terrorism. Media outlets such as CNN and some crime violence research groups such as the Gun Violence Archive define mass shootings as involving \"four or more shot (injured or killed) in a single incident, at the same general time and location, not including the shooter\". Mother Jones magazine defines mass shootings as indiscriminate rampages killing three or more individuals excluding the perpetrator, gang violence, and armed robbery. An Australian study from 2006 specifies five individuals killed. The number of people killed in mass shootings is difficult to determine due to the lack of a commonly agreed definition. In the United States, there were 103 deaths in mass shootings in 2021 (excluding the perpetrators) using the FBI's definition, and 706 deaths using the Gun Violence Archive's definition. The FBI's definition refers to \"active shooter incidents\" defined as \"one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area\", while the Gun Violence Archive's definition counts incidents where at least four people (excluding the perpetrator) were shot, but not necessarily killed. The motive for mass shootings (that occur in public locations) is usually that they are committed by deeply disgruntled individuals who are seeking revenge for failures in school, career, romance, or life in general or who are seeking fame or attention with at least 16 mass shooters since the Columbine massacre citing fame or notoriety as a motive. Fame seekers average more than double the body counts, and many articulated a desire to surpass \"past records\".    Definitions   There are a variety of definitions of a mass shooting:  Mass Shooting Tracker, a crowdsourced data site cited by CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Economist, the BBC, etc., defines a mass shooting as any incident in which four or more people are shot, whether injured or killed. CBS defines a mass shooting as an event involving the shooting (not necessarily resulting in death) of five or more people (sometimes four) with no cooling-off period. Mother Jones defines a mass shooting as an indiscriminate rampage in a public place, resulting in three or more victims (excluding the perpetrator) killed by the attacker, excluding gang violence, armed robbery, and attacks by unidentified perpetrators. Crime violence research group Gun Violence Archive, whose research is used by major American media outlets, defines a mass shooting as having a \"minimum of four victims shot, either injured or killed, not including any shooter who may also have been killed or injured in the incident,\" differentiating between a mass shooting and mass murder and not counting shooters as victims. There are also different definitions of the term mass killing:  Under U.S. federal law, the Attorney General – on a request from a state – may assist in investigating \"mass killings\", rather than mass shootings. The term is defined as the murder of four or more people with no cooling-off period but redefined by Congress in 2013 as being the murder of three or more people. In \"Behind the Bloodshed\", a report by USA Today, a mass killing is defined as any incident in which four or more were killed, including familial killings. This definition is also used by the Washington Post. According to the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012, signed into law in January 2013, a mass killing is defined as a killing with at least three deaths, excluding the perpetrator. The lack of a single definition can lead to alarmism in the news media, with some reports conflating categories of different crimes. An act of mass shooting is typically defined as terrorist when it \"appears to have been intended\" to intimidate or to coerce people; although a mass shooting is not necessarily an act of terrorism solely by itself. The perpetrator is typically but not always excluded from the body count.    Prevalence  The number of people killed in mass shootings is difficult to determine due to the lack of a commonly agreed definition. It is also difficult to determine whether their frequency is increasing or decreasing over time, for the same reason. Albert Thompson( born 1912, date of death unknown) was a Welsh footballer. The first documented Catholic Mass in the Philippines was held on March 31, 1521, Easter Sunday. It was conducted by Father Pedro de Valderrama of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition along the shores of what was referred to in the journals of Antonio Pigafetta as \"Mazaua\". Today, this site is widely believed by many historians and the government to be Limasawa off the tip of Southern Leyte, However, until at least the 19th century, the prevailing belief was that the first mass was held in Butuan. This belief is maintained by some, who assert that the first mass was instead held at Masao, Butuan. To end the conflict for the issue about the first mass, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) panel adapted the recommendation and unanimously agreed that the evidence and arguments presented by the pro-Butuan advocates are not sufficient and convincing enough to warrant the repeal or reversal of the ruling on the case by the National Historical Institute (the NHCP's forerunner). It is further strengthened by the evidence that it was only after 22 years, in 1543—when a Spanish expedition led by Ruy López de Villalobos landed in Mindanao.    Landing on Philippine shores  When Ferdinand Magellan and his European crew sailed from Sanlúcar de Barrameda for an expedition to search for spices, these explorers landed on the Philippines after their voyage from other proximate areas. On March 28, 1521, while at sea, they saw a bonfire which turned out to be Mazaua (believed to be today's Limasawa) where they anchored.    Log of Francisco Albo   On March 16, 1521, as they sailed in a westerly course from the Islas de los Ladrones, known today as the Mariana Islands, they saw land towards the northwest but they didn't land there due to shallow places and later found its name as Yunagan. On that same day, they went in a small island called Suluan which is a part of Samar and there they anchored. Leaving from those two islands, they sailed westward to an island of Gada where they took in a supply of wood and water from that island, they sailed towards west to a large island called Seilani (now Leyte). Along the coast of Seilani, they sailed southwards and turned southwest until they reached the island of Mazava. From there, they sailed northwards again towards the Island of Seilani and followed the coast of Seilani towards northwest and saw three small islands. They sailed westwards and saw three islets where they anchored for the night. In the morning, they sailed southwest. There, they entered canal between two island, one of which was called Sugbu (now called Cebu) and the other was Matan (now called Mactan). They sailed towards southwest on that canal then turned westward and anchored at the town of Sugbu wherein they stayed there for many days.    Diary of Antonio Pigafetta   Antonio Pigafetta was a famous Italian traveler who studied navigation and known by the name of Antonio Lambardo or Francisco Antonio Pigafetta. He joined the Portuguese, Captain Ferdinand Magellan and his Spanish crew on their trip to Maluku Island. Pigafetta has the most complete account of Magellan expedition entitled Primo viaggio intorno al mondo (First Voyage around the world). He was one of the eighteen survivors who returned to Spain aboard the \"Victoria\" and therefore considered as an eyewitness of the significant events happened on the first mass of which Magellan names it the Islands of Saint Lazarus that is later called the Philippine Archipelago. Pigafetta narrated on his account the events happened from March 16, 1521, when they first saw the Island of the Philippine group up to April 7, 1521, when the expedition landed on Cebu. On March 16, 1521, there was a \"high land\" named \"Zamal\" that was sighted by the Magellan's expedition which was some 300 leagues westward of the Ladrones Island. On March 17, 1521, they landed on \"uninhabited island\" or known as \"Humunu\" (Homonhon) which Pigafetta referred to as \"Watering place of good signs\" because the place is abundant in gold. Humunu lays right of Zamal at 10 degrees north latitude. They stayed there 8 days from March 17 to 25, 1521. On March 25, 1521, they left the island of Homonhon and change route towards west southwest, between four islands: namely, Cenalo, Hiunanghan, Ibusson, and Albarien.

Its plot follows Mary Henry, a young woman whose life is disturbed after a car accident. She relocates to a new city, where she finds herself unable to assimilate with the locals, and becomes drawn to the pavilion of an abandoned carnival; director Harvey also appears in the film as a ghoulish stranger who stalks her throughout.

Filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, and Salt Lake City, Carnival of Souls was shot on a budget of $33,000, and Harvey employed various guerrilla filmmaking techniques to finish the production. The film is loosely based on the French short An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (1961), an adaptation of the 1890 story of the same name by Ambrose Bierce, and Harvey was inspired by the visual style of filmmakers such as Ingmar Bergman and Jean Cocteau. Carnival of Souls was Harvey's only feature film, and did not gain widespread attention when originally released as a double feature with the now mostly forgotten The Devil's Messenger in 1962. Since the 1980s, the film has been noted by critics and film scholars for its cinematography and foreboding atmosphere. The film has a large cult following and is occasionally screened at film and Halloween festivals.    Plot  In Kansas, Mary Henry is riding in a car with two other young women when two men challenge them to a road race. During the race, the women's car is nudged by the boys’ and plunges off a bridge into a muddy river. Three hours after the police start dredging the water to look for them, Mary miraculously surfaces on the river bank, but cannot remember how she survived.  Mary moves to Salt Lake City, where she has been hired as a church organist. While driving near an abandoned pavilion on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, Mary begins experiencing visions of a ghoulish, pale-faced figure (referred to as \"The Man\" in the credits). A gas station attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before it was abandoned. In town, Mary rents a room and visits the church where she will be playing the organ. Mary takes a ride out to the pavilion at the lake with the church's minister who stops her from entering, warning that it is against the law. Mary continues experiencing visions of The Man and also rejects the repeated advances of John, a neighboring lodger. Mary goes to the pavilion by herself to investigate but does not find anything. Later, Mary begins experiencing terrifying interludes when she becomes invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world, as if she were not there. During one of these episodes, Mary meets Dr. Samuels who offers to help her while acknowledging he is not a psychiatrist. Mary returns to the church by herself to practice the organ and finds herself shifting from a hymn to eerie music. In a trance, she sees visions of The Man and other ghouls dancing at the pavilion. The minister, hearing the strange music, denounces it as sacrilege and insists that Mary resign. That night, Mary accompanies John to a bar. Terrified of being alone with her nightmares, Mary tells John she wants his company. When they return home, John tries to convince Mary to let him stay the night, however Mary becomes hysterical when she sees The Man in the mirror. John leaves, believing Mary to be insane. The following morning, Mary returns to the pavilion where she encounters The Man and his fellow ghouls. She tries frantically to escape, however the locals do not acknowledge her and she only encounters more ghouls until she wakes up, revealing the previous scene to be merely a nightmare. She is later drawn back to the pavilion once again, where she finds the ghouls dancing, with a ghoul version of herself paired with The Man. She tries to run away but is chased by the ghouls onto the beach, where she collapses as they close in. The following day, Dr. Samuels, the minister, and the police go to the pavilion to look for Mary. They find her footprints but note that she has otherwise vanished. Back in Kansas, the submerged car is finally pulled from the river. Mary's body is seen in the front seat alongside the other two women.

The album is a departure from the band's classic hard rock style, favoring a dark and dense grunge-oriented sound. It is also the band's last album of their unmasked era.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe album was recorded between late 1995 and early 1996, but Kiss cancelled its release after committing to a reunion tour with the band's original lineup. Bootleg copies were circulated by fans, prompting the band to officially release the material in 1997 under the title Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions. According to guitarist Bruce Kulick, the bootleg versions in distribution lacked songs that were part of the official release. There was no accompanying tour to support the album, and none of the songs on Carnival of Souls have ever been performed live by Kiss, though the album's closing track \"I Walk Alone\" has occasionally been performed live by Eric Singer and Kulick in the Eric Singer Project. \"Jungle\" and \"I Walk Alone\" were also performed live by Kulick's former band, Union.\nTwo former members of the band Black 'N Blue co-wrote songs on Carnival of Souls; vocalist Jaime St. James co-wrote \"In My Head\", and guitarist Tommy Thayer collaborated on \"Childhood's End\". Thayer would join Kiss as the band's permanent lead guitarist in 2002. Bruce Kulick provides his first and only lead vocal with the band on \"I Walk Alone\". Carnival of Souls is the band's longest album at 60 minutes and 11 seconds.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nGuitarist Bruce Kulick wrote on his official website that Carnival of Souls had \"people equally vocal about it being their favorite Kiss CD or thinking it's the worst Kiss album ever\". The album reached No. 27 on the US Billboard 200 chart and the only single released from the album, \"Jungle\", made No. 8 on the US Mainstream Rock chart.

He grew up in Waverly, Illinois and in Fort Collins and was a graduate of Fort Collins High School before serving in the U.S. Navy as a Quartermaster, 3rd Class, during World War II, during which time he was studying chemical engineering. \"But when I got out,\" Harvey said, \"I decided that wasn't for me and so I went into the theater.\" Harvey came to Lawrence, Kansas in 1945 to study at the University of Kansas, where he majored in theater and acted in scores of college stage productions, including Hay Fever, The Skin of Our Teeth, Beggar on Horseback, Juno and the Paycock, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Joan of Lorraine, Blithe Spirit, Harvey, and Hamlet. During his years at KU, Harvey served as vice-president of the Dramatics Workshop and was a member of the Owl Society, an honorary organization for male juniors. He earned a bachelor of science degree in education from the KU speech and drama department in 1948 and subsequently became employed by that department as an instructor, while also a graduate student. Harvey made his directorial debut with an \"experimental\" production of Irwin Shaw's Bury the Dead in 1949, and went on to direct several other plays and pageants at the university. He received his master of arts degree in speech and dramatics from KU in 1950. The subject of his master's thesis was his experience directing Bury the Dead for the KU stage. Besides his student appearances, Harvey gained acting experience through some work in summer stock, performing on the stages of the Topeka Civic Theater and Kansas City's Resident Theater. It was with the latter organization that Harvey portrayed Stanley Kowalski in a 1958 production of A Streetcar Named Desire. On June 3, 1950, Harvey's 26th birthday, he married Bernice \"Bea\" Brady, a Wichita native with whom he had performed in numerous KU theater productions. Immediately following the marriage, Harvey did a graduate study in drama during the 1950 summer session at the University of Denver, and then studied at the University of Colorado for a doctorate. \"I made it through summer school and then I decided to go back to Kansas,\" Harvey has said. He and his wife then returned to Lawrence and both landed jobs teaching theater, Harvey at KU and his wife at the local high school.    Centron Films  While teaching and directing at the university, Harvey broke into the film business as an actor in some of the movies being made by Centron Corporation of Lawrence, an independent industrial and educational film production company. Founded in 1947 in Lawrence by Arthur H. Wolf and Russell A. Mosser, Centron would come to the forefront of the industrial and educational film companies in the United States. Harvey joined the staff in 1952 and went on to work for Centron as a film director, writer, and producer for over three decades, making a variety of short industrial, educational, documentary, and government films. Films created by Harvey include Shake Hands With Danger, which won a 1980 Golden Eagle award from the Council on International Nontheatrical Events. Centron competed with large companies on both coasts to become one of the top producers of industrial and educational films. Harvey was known for his high quality films, coming in on time and under budget. Harvey and his film crews were dispatched to far-flung locations around the globe to bring back images for geography and travel films. Harvey also worked with many well-known professional actors and entertainers in Centron films, such as Walter Pidgeon, Rowan and Martin, Dennis Day, Louis Nye, George Gobel, Billy Barty, Anita Bryant, Eddie Albert, Ed Ames, Jesse White, and Ricardo Montalbán. The director won many national and international awards for his work, including the highest honors from the American Film Festival, C.I.N.E., and the Columbus Film Festival. An article written by Harvey was published in the March 1956 issue of American Cinematographer magazine, concerning innovative special effects techniques that had been developed by the Centron crew during the production of an industrial film. Harvey also occasionally penned reviews of local theater productions for the Lawrence newspaper. In 1957, Harvey commissioned the construction of a custom-built house within a block of the Centron studios. The resultant home was hailed regionally as an exceptional display of modern suburban architecture and attracted thousands of spectators when opened for public inspection upon its completion.

Farley auditioned for the part and was cast after three auditions. Since the producers were searching for a girl who looked quirky Farley dyed her then blonde hair red. This look was inspired by the character Lola (Franka Potente) from the German film Run Lola Run. However, the series was canceled and so Farley remained only six episodes in the series.\nIn 2014 Farley could be seen as Anna in Uvanga, directed by Hélène Cousineau and Madeline Ivalu. From 2014 to 2015 Farley played Judith Laramée in the series Mémoires vives from Radio-Canada. In 2015 she could be seen as Julia in four episodes of the series Heroes Reborn. She plays Julia, the wife of Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman), one of the main figures of the series. From 2015 to 2016 she starred as Nicole Breen in the TV series This Life. Farley later said that she loved playing Nicole since she was a bit of everything. She was very emotional and tried to be in control in which she did not succeed much. Farley enjoyed the complexity of her character.\nFarley has also worked as a producer, director and screenwriter. In 2015 Farley directed the short film Saccage. In 2017 she wrote and directed the short film Marguerite. This film has won 20 prestigious film awards, has been selected for over 70 film festivals, and was named as a shortlisted Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film nominee at the 91st Academy Awards.\n\n\n== Private life ==\nFarley is a mother.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of female film and television directors\nList of LGBT-related films directed by women\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMarianne Farley at IMDb\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Parishes with Mother Teresa as patroness  St. St. Mother Teresa Catholic Academy (SMTCA, St. Mother Teresa, SMT, Mother Teresa, or Teresa for short); also known as by its former names Blessed Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary School before 2016 and Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary School in its inception is a Catholic secondary school in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It serves the Malvern neighbourhood of Scarborough.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The founder of Missionaries of Charity ===\n\nThe school is named after Mother Teresa of Calcutta founded the Roman Catholic religious congregation, Missionaries of Charity, which in 2012 consisted of over 4,500 sisters and is active in 133 countries. Her beatification by Pope John Paul II in 2003 following her death gave her the title \"Blessed Teresa of Calcutta\".\n\n\n=== Foundings ===\n\nAfter the construction of several subdivisions in the Malvern area in the 1970s, Lester B. Pearson Collegiate Institute, the high school in that area, was opened in 1978.\nIn its conception, on September 3, 1985, a new school in the Scarborough area of Toronto was to be named Mary Ward. Then trustee Harold Adams advocated for the new school to be named Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary School. Another school was built later, and that received the name Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School. The ideals of the school's patroness and namesake, Mother Teresa, became the inspiration for the school's motto. The first principal was George Iantorno, and the school initially had approximately 150 grade 9 students.\nThe first four years were known as the \"Tin Can\" experience because the school was housed in relocatables and a port-o-pac located on Invergordon Avenue, close to the then newly opened St. Elizabeth Seton Elementary School. The expansionist era began with year five in 1989-90. A school filled with 650 students left the port-o-pac rooms and soon moved into the new structure of 984 pupils and doubled its enrolment. Mother Teresa's new facility was officially opened and blessed on April 29, 1990.\nAs a result of the beatification, the board changed the school's name to Blessed Mother Teresa in 2003. Her subsequent canonization and enrolment increase attempt led the board to rebrand the school as St. Mother Teresa Catholic Academy in October 2016.\n\n\n== Location and community ==\n54 Ethnic minorities are represented in its student population, reflecting the diverse Malvern community that the school serves.\nSMT stands at the corner of Sewells Road and McLevin Road, off Neilson Road between Sheppard Avenue East and Finch Avenue East. It is beside the Malvern Community and Recreational Centre, which also houses the Malvern Branch of the Toronto Public Library.\n\n\n=== Academics ===\nCourses taught at the school follow the Ontario Curriculum for Grades 9 through 12.\n\n\n=== Athletics ===\n\nJunior Boys Basketball\nGirls Basketball\nSenior Boys Basketball - 2nd place at the AAAA OFSAA championship in 2005, and 1st at the AAAA OFSAA championship in 2006\nJunior Girls Volleyball\nSenior Girls Volleyball\nJunior Boys Volleyball\nSenior Boys Volleyball\nJunior Boys Soccer\nSenior Boys Soccer\nBadminton\nTable Tennis\nTrack and Field\nCross Country\n\n\n== See also ==\nEducation in Ontario\nList of secondary schools in Ontario\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt. Mother Teresa Catholic Academy\nTCDSB Portal St. Mary High School is a private, Roman Catholic high school in Dell Rapids, South Dakota.

Joe Cunningham (1931–2021), baseball first baseman and outfielder who played in Major League Baseball for the St. Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu MC (born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, Albanian: [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒi.u]; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as Mother Teresa, was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity. Born in Skopje, then part of the Ottoman Empire, at the age of 18 she moved to Ireland and later to India, where she lived most of her life. On 4 September 2016, she was canonised by the Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. The anniversary of her death, 5 September, is her feast day. Mother Teresa founded Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation, which grew to have over 4,500 nuns across 133 countries as of 2012. The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give \"wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.\" Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. A controversial figure during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work, but was criticised for her views on abortion and contraception, as well as the poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorised biography, written by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992, and she has been the subject of many other works. On 6 September 2017, Mother Teresa and Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.    Biography     Early life   Mother Teresa's given name was Anjezë Gonxhe (or Gonxha) Bojaxhiu (Anjezë is a cognate of Agnes; Gonxhe means \"flower bud\" in Albanian). She was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian family in Skopje, Ottoman Empire (now the capital of North Macedonia). She was baptised in Skopje the day after her birth. She later considered 27 August, the day she was baptised, her \"true birthday\". She was the youngest child of Nikollë and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai). Her father, who was involved in Albanian-community politics in Ottoman Macedonia, died in 1919 when she was eight years old. He was born in Prizren (today in Kosovo), however, his family was from Mirdita (present-day Albania). Her mother may have been from a village near Gjakova, believed by her offspring to be Bishtazhin. According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, Anjezë was in her early years when she became fascinated by stories of the lives of missionaries and their service in Bengal; by age 12, she was convinced that she should commit herself to religious life. Her resolve strengthened on 15 August 1928 as she prayed at the shrine of the Black Madonna of Vitina-Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimages. Anjezë left home in 1928 at age 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham, Ireland, to learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary; English was the language of instruction of the Sisters of Loreto in India. She saw neither her mother nor her sister again. Her family lived in Skopje until 1934, when they moved to Tirana. She arrived in India in 1929 and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas, where she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's School near her convent. She took her first religious vows on 24 May 1931. She chose to be named after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of missionaries; because a nun in the convent had already chosen that name, she opted for its Spanish spelling of Teresa. Teresa took her solemn vows on 14 May 1937 while she was a teacher at the Loreto convent school in Entally, eastern Calcutta, taking the style of 'Mother' as part of Loreto custom. She served there for nearly twenty years and was appointed its headmistress in 1944. Although Mother Teresa enjoyed teaching at the school, she was increasingly disturbed by the poverty surrounding her in Calcutta.

Down by five points in the last minute of play, the 1935 team won the Group II (since recategorized as Non-Public A) state title with a 32–31 win against St. Peter's in overtime. The baseball team won the Non-Public Group B state championship in 1962 (defeating Gloucester Catholic High School in the tournament final), 1968 (vs. Mater Dei High School) and 1998 (vs. Sacred Heart High School), and won the Non-Public C title in 1976 (vs. St. Peter's Preparatory School) and 1977 (vs. St. Joseph High School of Hammonton). The 1998 team finished the season with a 22–5 record after winning the Group B title with a 7–6 victory against Sacred Heart in the championship game. The football team won the Non-Public B North state sectional title in 1976 and 1980, and the Non-Public Group I title in 2006. The 1976 team finished the season 10-0 after winning the Parochial B North sectional title with a 49–14 win in the championship game against a Pope John XXIII Regional High School team that had won 24 consecutive games and hadn't lost in 43 games, the state's longest streak at the time. The 1980 team won the Parochial B North state title with a 6–0 victory against Pope John XXIII after scoring a touchdown in double overtime to finish the season with an 8-0-1 record. The team won the 2006 Non-Public Group I sectional title with a 20–13 win in the championship game against Paterson Catholic High School, a team that hadn't lost all season coming into the game. The softball team won the Non-Public B state championship in 1998 to finish the season with a 31–2 record after defeating St. Joseph High School by a score of 3–2 in the tournament final in extra innings. The wrestling team was recognized as the winner of the 2007 team wrestling tournament for the Non-Public, North B state sectional championship. The wrestling team moved on to win the NJSIAA 2007 team wrestling Non-Public Group B state championship, topping Bishop George Ahr High School, 53–19. Rutherford is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 18,834, an increase of 773 (+4.3%) from the 2010 census count of 18,061, which in turn reflected a decline of 49 (−0.3%) from the 18,110 counted in the 2000 census. Rutherford was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 21, 1881, from portions of Union Township, based on the results of a referendum held on the previous day. The borough was named for John Rutherfurd, a U.S. Senator who owned land in the area. Rutherford has been called the \"Borough of Trees\" and \"The First Borough of Bergen County\", and is known as well for its pedestrian-focused downtown area adjacent to the borough's Bergen County Line (New Jersey Transit) railway station.    History  The ridge above the New Jersey Meadowlands upon which Rutherford sits was settled by Lenape Native Americans long before the arrival of Walling Van Winkle in 1687. Union Avenue, which runs from the Meadowlands to the Passaic River, may have been an Indian trail, but was more likely a property boundary line; it was referenced in the 1668 grant of land by proprietary Governor Philip Carteret to John Berry.  During the early days of settlement, the land that is now Rutherford was part of New Barbadoes Township, as Berry had lived in Barbados, another English colony, before claiming his grant in New Jersey. New Barbadoes was part of Essex County from 1693 to 1710, when Bergen County was formed. In 1826, the land became part of Lodi Township (of which today's remaining portion is now South Hackensack). When Hudson County was formed in 1840, the area that is today North Arlington, Lyndhurst, Rutherford and East Rutherford became part of Harrison Township (of which today's remaining portion is Harrison town). However, the area reverted to Bergen County in 1852 and became known as Union Township. Part of the region was known as Boiling Springs for a powerful and ceaseless spring located in the vicinity. Despite its name, the spring actually consisted of cold groundwater seeps rather than hot springs. The Erie Railroad built its Main Line from Jersey City across the Meadowlands in the 1840s. Daniel Van Winkle, a descendant of Walling, donated land in 1866 for a train station at Boiling Springs. Several resorts were built along the Passaic, with guests disembarking at Boiling Springs station and taking Union Avenue to the river. Later, the railroad opened a station closer to the river, at Carlton Hill, and a horsecar line (briefly on rails) along Jackson Ave took travelers to the resort area. At the time, much of the property in Rutherford was farmland owned by the estate of John Rutherfurd, a former New Jersey legislator and U.S. Senator, whose homestead was along the Passaic River, near present-day Rutherford Avenue. Van Winkle opened a real estate office at Depot Square (now Station Square) to sell the land of the Rutherfurd Park Association, and began to lay out the area's street grid. The main roads were Orient Way, a wide boulevard heading south-southwest from Station Square, and Park Avenue, which headed west-southwest from Station Square to bring traffic to the new Valley Brook Race Course in what is now Lyndhurst. In the 1870s, the area began to be called \"Rutherford\". The definitive reason for the change in spelling of the final syllable from \"furd\" to \"ford\" is unknown, though the change may have been the result of name recognition of the Ohio politician Rutherford B. Hayes, who was elected President in 1876, or could have been because of a clerical error by the United States Postal Service. The Post Office opened a facility called \"Rutherford\" in 1876. On September 21, 1881, the Borough of Rutherford was formed by formal vote of secession from Union Township. By then, the community had about 1,000 residents.    Historic sites  Rutherford is home to the following locations on the National Register of Historic Places:  Iviswold – 223 Montross Avenue (added 2004). Located on the campus of Felician College, a $9 million renovation project of the Iviswold castle that took 14 years was completed in 2013. Originally constructed by Floyd W. St. Mother Teresa High School is a Catholic secondary school in the Nepean district of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It supports grades 7–12. The name of its sports team is the 'Titans'. The motto of the school is \"Amor et Dignitas\" or \"love and dignity.\" == Sports ==\nMother Teresa has many sports teams, including alpine skiing, badminton, baseball (does not have a team every year), basketball, cross country running, field hockey, golf, handball, hockey, Nordic skiing, rugby, Ski Club, soccer, softball, field lacrosse, swimming, Touch Football, football, track and field, varsity girls' rugby, varsity girls touch football, volleyball, weight room, and wrestling.\nOn May 28, 2014, the OFSAA division baseball team won the NCSSAA city championship giving the school its seventh city championship win of the school year.\n\n\n== Arts ==\nMother Teresa's Drama Department put on a production of twinkly stars in 2015. The production was nominated for 16 Cappies awards in total.\n\n\n== 2011 Explosion ==\nOn May 26, 2011, an empty barrel of peppermint oil exploded in an auto-shop class, killing 18-year-old student Eric Leighton, a hockey player with the Almonte Thunder. as well as causing minor injuries to four other students and one staff member.\n\n\n== Renaming ==\nOn 4 September 2016, the school's patron Mother Teresa was canonized into Sainthood by Pope Francis. She is now referred to as Saint Teresa of Calcutta in the Catholic Church. The Ottawa Catholic School Board decided to rename the high school, St. Mother Teresa Catholic High School to keep with tradition.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEducation in Ontario\nList of high schools in Ontario\nList of Ottawa schools Catholic nun and missionary Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, commonly known as Mother Teresa and known as Saint Teresa of Calcutta since 2016, has a complicated public image. She has been widely admired by many for her charitable work, which led to her being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \"for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace\". During her life she was highly celebrated, receiving multiple awards and honorary degrees, as well as consistently ranking as one of the world's most admired people. She is also venerated by many Catholics who consider her a saint and ask for her intercession.  She has also been subject to criticism, including objections to the quality of the medical care which she provided, suggestions that some deathbed baptisms constituted forced conversions, and alleged links to colonialism and racism and alleged relationships with questionable public figures.  These criticisms have been rebutted by some commentators, with a notable theme being the claim that critics do not understand her motivations and that she is being unfairly held to Western standards.    Recognition and reception     In India  From the Indian government, under the name of Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu, Mother Teresa was issued a diplomatic passport.  She received the Padma Shri in 1962 and the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1969. She later received other Indian awards, including the Bharat Ratna (India's highest civilian award) in 1980. Mother Teresa's official biography, by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992. In Calcutta, she is worshipped as a deity by some Hindus. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of her birth, the government of India issued a special ₹5 coin (the amount of money Mother Teresa had when she arrived in India) on 28 August 2010. President Pratibha Patil said, \"Clad in a white sari with a blue border, she and the sisters of Missionaries of Charity became a symbol of hope to many—namely, the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally ill, and those abandoned by their families.\"    Internationally  Mother Teresa received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Peace and International Understanding, given for work in South or East Asia, in 1962. According to its citation, \"The Board of Trustees recognises her merciful cognisance of the abject poor of a foreign land, in whose service she has led a new congregation\". By the early 1970s, Mother Teresa was an international celebrity. She had been catapulted to fame via Malcolm Muggeridge's 1969 BBC documentary, Something Beautiful for God, before he released a 1971 book of the same name. Muggeridge was undergoing a spiritual journey of his own at the time. During filming, footage shot in poor lighting (particularly at the Home for the Dying) was thought unlikely to be usable by the crew; the crew had been using new, untested photographic film. In England, the footage was found to be extremely well-lit and Muggeridge called it a miracle of \"divine light\" from Teresa. Other crew members said that it was due to a new type of ultra-sensitive Kodak film. Muggeridge later converted to Catholicism. Around this time, the Catholic world began to honour Mother Teresa publicly. Pope Paul VI gave her the inaugural Pope John XXIII Peace Prize in 1971, commending her work with the poor, her display of Christian charity and her efforts for peace. She received the Pacem in Terris Award in 1976. She was honoured by governments and civilian organisations and appointed an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia in 1982 \"for service to the community of Australia and humanity at large\". The United Kingdom and the United States bestowed a number of awards, culminating in the Order of Merit in 1983 and honorary citizenship of the United States on 16 November 1996. Mother Teresa's Albanian homeland gave her the Golden Honour of the Nation in 1994, but her acceptance of this and the Haitian Legion of Honour was controversial. Mother Teresa was criticised for implicitly supporting the Duvaliers and corrupt businessmen such as Charles Keating and Robert Maxwell; she wrote to the judge of Keating's trial requesting clemency. Universities in India and the West granted her honorary degrees. Other civilian awards included the Balzan Prize for promoting humanity, peace and brotherhood among peoples (1978) and the Albert Schweitzer International Prize (1975). In April 1976, Mother Teresa visited the University of Scranton in northeastern Pennsylvania, where she received the La Storta Medal for Human Service from university president William J. Byron. She challenged an audience of 4,500 to \"know poor people in your own home and local neighbourhood\", feeding others or simply spreading joy and love.

After her parents separated, her mother moved the family to California, where she married a grocer two years later, and changed their name to Kennedy. At the outbreak of World War I, their mother prepped seven-year-old Merna and brother Melvin (known as Merle) to tour as a dancing and singing sibling act on the Orpheum and Pantages theater circuits of vaudeville, where she became acquainted with Lita Grey. Merle broke his leg ending the duo, prompting Grey to suggest silent films to Merna. \nKennedy was best known during her brief career for her role opposite Charlie Chaplin in the silent film The Circus (1928), a role for which she was brought to the attention of Chaplin by her friend Lita Grey, who became Chaplin's second wife in 1924. She had red hair and muscular legs (due to being a dancer,) the latter of which helped her gain the role of the circus bareback rider.  \n\nKennedy continued acting after The Circus, starring in early sound films, but retired in 1934 when she married choreographer/director Busby Berkeley on February 10, 1934 at Hollywood United Methodist Church.

She is also known for her collaboration with director Mike Leigh on two of his films, Life is Sweet (1990) and Naked (1993).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nClaire Skinner was born and brought up in Hemel Hempstead, the youngest daughter of a shopkeeper and an Irish-born secretary, and was shy as a child. Her dream was to be an actress and she immersed herself in her ambition. She acted, neglecting school work at Cavendish School, and \"barely scraped through [her] A-levels\". She went on to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and then joined the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHer first role was in Hanky Park, by Walter Greenwood at the Oldham Repertory Theatre, which she describes as a \"really traditional start\". She is best known as Clare on the British television comedy Life Begins and as Lucinda, the sous chef in the first series of Chef! alongside Lenny Henry. From 2007 to 2016, she portrayed Sue Brockman in the sitcom Outnumbered. Skinner will reprise her role in a one off special set to air at Christmas 2024. For many years, she has preferred theatre to screen roles because she has been disappointed with her TV projects (\"apart from Mike Leigh's stuff\"), \"not just when you see the final thing, but also because it hasn't taken off.\"\nSkinner has worked with directors including Mike Leigh – in Life Is Sweet, and Naked – Trevor Nunn, Tim Burton and Sam Mendes, but according to her, Alan Ayckbourn \"was a great influence for me as he pushed me so hard, but every director you work with has a big influence in some way, they really push you.\"\nShe has made appearances in TV shows such as Lark Rise to Candleford where for two episodes she played Mrs Macey. She appeared in the 2011 Doctor Who Christmas special \"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\".\nIn 2019, she played Sheila in A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, which ran in Trafalgar Studios in the West End from September to November.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSkinner was previously married to director Charles Palmer, by whom she has two sons.

James Mason Crafts (March 8, 1839 – June 20, 1917) was an American chemist, mostly known for developing the Friedel–Crafts alkylation and acylation reactions with Charles Friedel in 1876.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nJames Crafts, the son of Royal Altamont Crafts and Marianne Mason (daughter of Senator Jeremiah Mason), was born in Boston, Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard University in 1858.  Although he never received his Ph.D., he studied chemistry in Germany at the Academy of Mines (1859) of Freiberg, and served as an assistant to Robert Bunsen at Heidelberg, and then with Wurtz in Paris (1861).\nIt was in Paris that Crafts first met Charles Friedel, with whom he later carried out some of his most successful research.  Crafts returned to the United States in 1865. In 1868, he was appointed as the first professor of chemistry at the newly founded Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he remained until 1870.\nDuring the following four years Crafts served as professor of chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but in 1874 took a leave of absence, joined Friedel in Paris, and devoted himself exclusively to scientific research. Upon his second return to the United States, in 1891, Crafts became professor of organic chemistry at MIT (1892–97), where he also served as president from 1898 to 1900. In 1900, Crafts resigned the presidency, and again turned to the investigation of problems in organic and physical chemistry.\n\n\n== Scientific work ==\nCraft's investigations were largely in the field of organic chemistry, but his name is connected also with many interesting achievements in physics and in physical chemistry.  He invented a new hydrogen thermometer; measured the densities of iodine at very high temperatures; demonstrated an interesting regularity in the variation of the boiling points of chemically allied substances with the external pressure; prepared a number of new compounds of the element silicon, which are interesting because of their chemical resemblance to the corresponding compounds of carbon; and also prepared new compounds of arsenic.  But his most important achievement was the discovery, jointly with Friedel, of one of the most fruitful synthetic methods in organic chemistry, the Friedel–Crafts reaction.\nHundreds of new carbon compounds have been brought into existence by this method (New International Encyclopedia), which is based on the catalytic action of the chloride of aluminium.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn recognition of Crafts's services to science, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1867 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1872. The French government made him a chevalier of the Legion of Honor (1885), and the British Association for the Advancement of Science made him one of its corresponding members. Harvard University conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. in 1898. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1916.\nThe Crafts entry at MIT's Senior House dormitory is named in his honor.\n\n\n== Selected writings ==\nA chronologically-arranged list of Crafts' papers is in the biographical note of Cross.\nQualitative Analysis (1869,  and several later editions)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAshdown, Avery A.

Ellen crossed the boundaries of race, class, and gender by passing as a white planter with William posing as her servant. Their escape was widely publicized, making them among the most famous fugitive slaves in the United States. Abolitionists featured them in public lectures to gain support in the struggle to end the institution. As prominent fugitives, they were threatened by slave catchers in Boston after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, so the Crafts emigrated to England. They lived there for nearly two decades and raised five children. The Crafts lectured publicly about their escape and opposed the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. In 1860, they published a written account of their escape titled Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom; Or, The Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery. One of the most compelling of the many slave narratives published before the Civil War, their book reached wide audiences in the United Kingdom and the United States. After their return to the U.S. in 1868, the Crafts opened an agricultural school in Georgia for freedmen's children. They worked at the school and its farm until 1890. Their account was reprinted in the United States in 1999, with both the Crafts credited as authors.    Early life  Ellen Craft was born in 1826 in Clinton, Georgia, to Maria, a mixed-race enslaved woman, and her wealthy planter owner, Major James Smith. At least three-quarters European by ancestry, Ellen was very fair-skinned and resembled her white half-siblings, who were her enslaver's legitimate children. Smith's wife gave the 11-year-old Ellen as a wedding gift to her daughter, Eliza Cromwell Smith, to get the girl out of the household and remove the evidence of her husband's crimes against humanity. After Eliza Smith married Dr. Robert Collins, she took Ellen with her to live in the city of Macon where they made their home. Ellen grew up as a house servant to Eliza, which gave her privileged access to information about the area. William was born in Macon, where he met his future wife at the age of 16 when his first enslaver sold him to settle gambling debts. Before he was sold, William witnessed his 14-year-old sister and his parents being separated by sales to different owners. William's new enslaver apprenticed him as a carpenter and allowed him to work for fees, taking most of his earnings.    Marriage and family  At age 20, Ellen married William Craft, in whom her enslaver Collins held a half interest. Craft saved money from being hired out in town as a carpenter. Not wanting to have a family in slavery, during the Christmas season of 1848, the couple planned an escape. Eventually, they had five children born and raised during their nearly two decades living in England. The Crafts went there after the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed because they were in danger of being captured in Boston by bounty hunters. Their children were Charles Estlin Phillips (1852–1938), William Ivens (1855–1926), Brougham H. (1857–1920), Ellen A. Craft (1863–1917) and Alfred G. (1871–1939). Three of their children came with them when the Crafts returned to the United States after the American Civil War.    Escape  Ellen planned to take advantage of her appearance to pass as white while the pair traveled by train and boat to the North; she dressed as a man since, at the time, it was not customary for a white woman to travel alone with an enslaved man. She also faked illness to limit conversation, as she was prevented from learning to read and write with the threat of death because she was enslaved. William was to act as a personal servant. During that time, enslaved people frequently accompanied their enslavers during travel, so the Crafts did not expect to be questioned. To their surprise, they were detained, but only temporarily. An officer had demanded proof that William was indeed Ellen's property. They were finally let on the train due to sympathy from passengers and the conductor. Their escape is known as the most ingenious plot in fugitive slave history, even more ingenious than that of \"Henry Box Brown.\" During their escape, they traveled on first-class trains, stayed in the best hotels, and Ellen dined one evening with a steamboat captain. Ellen dyed her hair and bought appropriate clothes to pass as a young man, traveling in a jacket and trousers.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

An enigmatic figure, he made no writings, and is known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers writing after his lifetime, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. Other sources include the contemporaneous Antisthenes, Aristippus, and Aeschines of Sphettos. Aristophanes, a playwright, is the main contemporary author to have written plays mentioning Socrates during Socrates' lifetime, though a fragment of Ion of Chios' \"Travel Journal\" provides important information about Socrates' youth. Plato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, from which Socrates has become renowned for his contributions to the fields of ethics and epistemology. It is this who lends his name to the concepts of Socratic irony and the Socratic method, or \"elenchus.\" However, questions remain regarding the distinction between the real-life Socrates and Plato's portrayal of Socrates in his dialogues. Socrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in later antiquity and in the modern era. Depictions of Socrates in art, literature and popular culture have made him one of the most widely known figures in the Western philosophical tradition. Socrates (; Greek: Σωκράτης; c. 470 – 399 BC) was a Greek philosopher from Athens who is credited as the founder of Western philosophy and as among the first moral philosophers of the ethical tradition of thought. An enigmatic figure, Socrates authored no texts and is known mainly through the posthumous accounts of classical writers, particularly his students Plato and Xenophon. These accounts are written as dialogues, in which Socrates and his interlocutors examine a subject in the style of question and answer; they gave rise to the Socratic dialogue literary genre. Contradictory accounts of Socrates make a reconstruction of his philosophy nearly impossible, a situation known as the Socratic problem. Socrates was a polarizing figure in Athenian society. In 399 BC, he was accused of impiety and corrupting the youth. After a trial that lasted a day, he was sentenced to death. He spent his last day in prison, refusing offers to help him escape. Plato's dialogues are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity. They demonstrate the Socratic approach to areas of philosophy including epistemology and ethics. The Platonic Socrates lends his name to the concept of the Socratic method, and also to Socratic irony. The Socratic method of questioning, or elenchus, takes shape in dialogue using short questions and answers, epitomized by those Platonic texts in which Socrates and his interlocutors examine various aspects of an issue or an abstract meaning, usually relating to one of the virtues, and find themselves at an impasse, completely unable to define what they thought they understood. Socrates is known for proclaiming his total ignorance; he used to say that the only thing he was aware of was his ignorance, seeking to imply that the realization of our ignorance is the first step in philosophizing. Socrates exerted a strong influence on philosophers in later antiquity and has continued to do so in the modern era. He was studied by medieval and Islamic scholars and played an important role in the thought of the Italian Renaissance, particularly within the humanist movement. Interest in him continued unabated, as reflected in the works of Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. Depictions of Socrates in art, literature, and popular culture have made him a widely known figure in the Western philosophical tradition.    Sources and the Socratic problem   Socrates did not document his teachings. All that is known about him comes from the accounts of others: mainly the philosopher Plato and the historian Xenophon, who were both his pupils; the Athenian comic dramatist Aristophanes (Socrates's contemporary); and Plato's pupil Aristotle, who was born after Socrates's death. The often contradictory stories from these ancient accounts only serve to complicate scholars' ability to reconstruct Socrates's true thoughts reliably, a predicament known as the Socratic problem. The works of Plato, Xenophon, and other authors who use the character of Socrates as an investigative tool, are written in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and his interlocutors and provide the main source of information on Socrates's life and thought. Socratic dialogues (logos sokratikos) was a term coined by Aristotle to describe this newly formed literary genre. While the exact dates of their composition are unknown, some were probably written after Socrates's death. As Aristotle first noted, the extent to which the dialogues portray Socrates authentically is a matter of some debate.    Plato and Xenophon  An honest man, Xenophon was no trained philosopher. He could neither fully conceptualize nor articulate Socrates's arguments. He admired Socrates for his intelligence, patriotism, and courage on the battlefield. He discusses Socrates in four works: the Memorabilia, the Oeconomicus, the Symposium, and the Apology of Socrates. He also mentions a story featuring Socrates in his Anabasis. Oeconomicus recounts a discussion on practical agricultural issues. Like Plato's Apology, Xenophon's Apologia describes the trial of Socrates, but the works diverge substantially and, according to W. K. C. Guthrie, Xenophon's account portrays a Socrates of \"intolerable smugness and complacency\". Symposium is a dialogue of Socrates with other prominent Athenians during an after-dinner discussion, but is quite different from Plato's Symposium: there is no overlap in the guest list. In Memorabilia, he defends Socrates from the accusations of corrupting the youth and being against the gods; essentially, it is a collection of various stories gathered together to construct a new apology for Socrates. Plato's representation of Socrates is not straightforward. Plato was a pupil of Socrates and outlived him by five decades. The place of birth( POB) or birthplace is the place where a person was born. This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be the country that currently has\" sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth, regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth. Some countries place less or no importance on the place of birth, instead using alternative geographical characteristics for the purpose of identity documents. For example, Sweden has used the concept of\" födelsehemortdomicile of birth\") since 1947. This means that the domicile of the baby's mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant. Similarly, Switzerland uses the concept of\" Heimatortlieu d'origineluogo d'origineplace of origin\" in German, French and Italian respectively). A child born to Swiss parents is automatically assigned the place of origin of the parent with the same last name, so the child either gets their mother's or father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the place of origin of their Swiss parent. In a Swiss passport and identity card, the holder's place of origin is stated, not their place of birth. In some countries( primarily in the Americas), the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to by the Latin phrase\" jus soli\". Almost all countries outside the Americas instead attribute nationality based on the nationality( ies) of the baby's parents( referred to as\" jus sanguinis\"). There can be some confusion regarding the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born on an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality( ies) of the parents and/ or the location of the plane or ship( if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country). Some administrative forms may request the applicant's\" country of birth\". It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the applicant's\" place of birth\" or\" nationality at birth\". For US citizens born abroad who under the US Constitution acquire US citizenship at the time of birth, the nationality at birth will be USA( American), while the place of birth would be the country in which the actual birth takes place. Lamprocles  was Socrates' and Xanthippe's eldest son. His two brothers were Menexenus and Sophroniscus. Lamprocles was only a boy (μειράκιον \"meirakion\") at the time of Socrates' trial and death. According to Aristotle, Socrates' descendants as a whole turned out to be unremarkable \"fools and dullards\". Lamprocles (Greek: Λαμπροκλῆς) was Socrates' and Xanthippe's eldest son.  His two brothers were Menexenus and Sophroniscus.  Lamprocles was a youth (μειράκιον meirakion) at the time of Socrates' trial and death.  According to Aristotle, Socrates' descendants as a whole turned out to be unremarkable \"fools and dullards\". \" Where Was I?\" may refer to: Valley of Death may refer to: The Death of Socrates (French: La Mort de Socrate) is an oil on canvas painted by French painter Jacques-Louis David in 1787. The painting was part of the neoclassical style, popular in the 1780s, that depicted subjects from the Classical age, in this case the story of the execution of Socrates as told by Plato in his Phaedo.  In this story, Socrates has been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and introducing strange gods, and has been sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock. Socrates uses his death as a final lesson for his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly. The Phaedo depicts the death of Socrates and is also Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher's final days, which is also detailed in Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito.    Description  In the painting, an elderly Socrates is dressed in a white robe and sits upright on a bed, one hand extended over a cup, the other gesturing in the air; he is still teaching. He is surrounded by his friends of varying ages, most showing emotional distress, unlike Socrates, who remains calm. The young man handing him the cup looks the other way, with his face in his free hand. Crito listens intently to his teacher's words while clutching his knee. An elderly man, Plato, sits at the end of the bed, slumped over and looking in his lap. To the left, other men are seen through an arch set in the background wall.  On the stairway in the background, Socrates' wife Xanthippe, who had been dismissed earlier by her husband, takes a wistful glance backward at the scene. David uses color to highlight the emotion in this painting. The shades of red are more muted on the edges of the painting and become more vibrant in the center, culminating in the dark red robe of the man holding the cup of poison, generally taken as offering the cup to Socrates rather than receiving it after Socrates had consumed its contents. The only two serene men, Socrates and Plato, are garbed in a contrasting bluish-white. The more muted color scheme of this painting may be a response to critics of David's Oath of the Horatii, who called his colors \"garish\". David simplifies the scene by removing many characters originally described in the dialogues of Plato.  He also displayed some artistic license in representing the ages of many of the pupils of Socrates, including Plato.  Socrates, while elderly, is depicted as rather more handsome and fit than a 70-year old of his era would be in a more realistic depiction; his face is also much more idealized than the classical bust that is typically used as a reference portrait of Socrates.  Plato would have been a young man at the time of Socrates's death, but in this painting he is the old man sitting at the foot of the bed.  David might have intended the painting to be set in Plato's imagination, where an elderly Plato attempts to conjure the scene in his imagination as he writes. David signed this painting in two places; he put his full signature under Crito, the young man clutching Socrates's thigh, and his initials under Plato. David's signature placement often had symbolic meaning – for example, in his painting of Stanisław Kostka Potocki, David signed in the collar of the dog that is barking at the sitter. In Death of Socrates, his signatures also have meaning. His initials under Plato are a reference to the fact that the story comes from Plato, a thanks for the inspiration. His fuller signature under Crito means that this is the character whom the artist identifies most with. This may be a reference for Crito's position in the composition – clutching Socrates's thigh. In this way, David would be seen as a man who likewise clutches at the morals and values that Socrates represents.    Creation and history  Rather than a royal commission, David received a direct private commission for the work in 1786 from the wealthy Charles-Michel Trudaine de la Sablière, the youngest son of Trudaine de Montigny's and around 20 years old at the time.  Trudaine was intrigued by a drama that Denis Diderot had considered writing but never completed.  One of the dramatic scenes that Diderot's unfinished did include was his death, which led to the commission for a painting.  David's friend at the time André Chénier was also a member of the \"Trudaine society\" circle, and David appears to have followed Chénier's suggestions on matters such as the pose of Socrates in reaching out for the cup while still teaching. Xanthippe (; Greek: Ξανθίππη [ksantʰíppɛː]; fl. 5th–4th century BCE) was an ancient Athenian, the wife of Socrates and mother of their three sons: Lamprocles, Sophroniscus, and Menexenus. She was likely much younger than Socrates, perhaps by as much as 40 years.    Name  Xanthippe means \"yellow horse\", from Ancient Greek: ξανθός xanthos \"blond\" and ἵππος hippos \"horse\". Hers is one of many Greek personal names with a horse theme (cf. Philippos \"Friend of Horses\", Hippocrates \"Horse-tamer\", etc.).  The hippos in an ancient Greek name often suggested aristocratic heritage. One additional reason for thinking Xanthippe's family was socially prominent was that her eldest son was named Lamprocles instead of \"Sophroniscus\" after Socrates' father Sophroniscus: the ancient Greek custom was to name one's first child after the more illustrious of the two grandfathers. Xanthippe's father is believed to have been named Lamprocles. If he was even more well-established in Athenian aristocracy than was Socrates' father, his name would have been the preferred choice for the name of the first-born son.    Character   Plato's portrayal of Xanthippe in the Phaedo suggests that she was a devoted wife and mother; this is the sole mention of her in Plato's works.  Xenophon, in his Memorabilia, portrays her in much the same light. However, he does make Lamprocles complain of her harshness. It is only in Xenophon's Symposium where Socrates agrees that she is (in Antisthenes' words) \"the hardest to get along with of all the women there are.\" Nevertheless, Socrates adds that he chose her precisely because of her argumentative spirit:  It is the example of the rider who wishes to become an expert horseman: \"None of your soft-mouthed, docile animals for me,\" he says; \"the horse for me to own must show some spirit\" in the belief, no doubt, if he can manage such an animal, it will be easy enough to deal with every other horse besides. And that is just my case. I wish to deal with human beings, to associate with man in general; hence my choice of wife. I know full well, that if I can tolerate her spirit, I can with ease attach myself to every human being else. Perhaps this picture of Xanthippe originated with the historical Antisthenes, one of Socrates' pupils, since Xenophon initially puts this view into his mouth. Aelian also depicts her as a jealous shrew in his description of an episode in which she tramples underfoot a large and beautiful cake sent to Socrates by Alcibiades.  Diogenes Laërtius tells of other stories involving Xanthippe's supposed bad attitude.  It seems that Xenophon's portrayal of her in his Symposium has been the most influential: Diogenes Laërtius, for example, seems to quote the Symposium passage, though he does not mention Xenophon by name, and the term \"Xanthippe\" has now come to mean any nagging scolding person, especially a shrewish wife. Later writers, such as Diogenes Laërtius who cite Aristotle as the earliest source, say that Socrates had a second wife called Myrto.  Plutarch tells of a similar story, reporting that it comes from a work entitled On Good Birth, but he expresses doubt as to whether it was written by Aristotle. In Plutarch's version of the story, Socrates, who was already married, merely attended to Myrto's financial concerns when she became a widow, which does not entail marriage; there is no other evidence on the matter. A different account of Xanthippe and Myrto is given in Aristoxenus's Life of Socrates written in the latter part of the fourth century BC that Aristoxenus asserts is based on first-person accounts by his father. This claims that Myrto was his legitimate wife and Xanthippe his mistress, whose child became legitimate. An unconfirmed anecdote purports that Xanthippe was once so enraged with her husband that she took a chamber pot and poured it out over Socrates' head, which – according to the tale  – the philosopher accepted with the allegory: \"After thunder comes the rain.\" The widely cited quote from Socrates about Xanthippe, is \"By all means, marry. Sócrates Brasileiro Sampaio de Souza Vieira de Oliveira (19 February 1954 – 4 December 2011), simply known as Sócrates [ˈsɔkɾat͡ʃis], was a Brazilian footballer who played as a midfielder. His medical degree and his political awareness, combined with style and quality of his play, earned him the nickname \"Doctor Socrates\". Easily recognizable for his beard and headband, Sócrates became the \"symbol of cool for a whole generation of football supporters\". In 1983, he was named South American Footballer of the Year. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. Socrates played for Brazil for seven years, scoring 22 goals and representing the nation in two World Cups. He  captained the team in the 1982 FIFA World Cup; playing in midfield alongside Zico, Falcão, Toninho Cerezo and Éder, considered one of the greatest Brazil national teams ever. He also appeared in the 1979 and 1983 Copa América. At club level, Sócrates played for Botafogo-SP before joining Corinthians in 1978. Representing Botafogo, Sócrates was the highest goalscorer in the 1976 Campeonato Paulista da Divisão Especial de Futebol Profissional. He moved to Italy to play for Fiorentina, returning to Brazil in 1985 to end his career.    Playing career     Club career  Sócrates was born in Belém do Pará. He began playing football professionally in 1974 for Botafogo-SP in Ribeirão Preto, but spent the majority of his career (1978 to 1984) with Corinthians, scoring 41 goals in 59 Brazilian Série A games, and 172 goals in 297 matches in total. In 1984–85, aged 30, Sócrates had his first experience abroad, playing in Italian Serie A with Fiorentina. He returned to his country after that sole season, representing Flamengo, Santos and former club Botafogo-SP, and retiring in 1989. During his period in Flamengo, he played 20 games, scoring 5 goals and won Campeonato Carioca: 1986. In 2004, more than a decade after retiring, 50-year-old Sócrates agreed to a one-month player-coaching deal with Garforth Town of the Northern Counties East Football League in England. He made his only appearance for the club on 20 November, against Tadcaster Albion, coming on as a substitute twelve minutes from time.    International career  Sócrates was capped 60 times for Brazil between May 1979 and June 1986, scoring 22 goals. He captained the national team at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and also appeared in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. In the latter edition, he scored twice, starting with the game's only goal against Spain in the group stage. he added another in the round-of-16 4–0 win over Poland, shooting his penalty kick without running; in the following game, against France, he tried to convert it in the same fashion, but had his shootout attempt saved by goalkeeper Joël Bats; France ultimately progressed to the semi-finals. Sócrates also represented his country at the 1979 and 1983 Copa América tournaments. In the latter he appeared in only one game, the second leg of the final against Uruguay (1–1 home draw, 3-1 aggregate loss).    Style of play  A former centre-forward, who later made a name for himself as a midfielder, playing in either an attacking or central midfield role, Sócrates was an elegant, talented, and technical playmaker, known for his great through passes, precise long balls, link-up play, and his vision on the field, as well as his physical strength; he was also a two-footed player. While he was mainly known for his ability to orchestrate attacking plays, he was a prolific goal scorer himself, courtesy of his powerful and accurate shot with his right foot, and his ability to make attacking runs into the area from behind. He was also an accurate penalty taker, while his height, heading ability, and elevation allowed him to excel in the air. He was also known, however, for often not taking part in his teammates' celebrations whenever he scored a goal. Although he was not the quickest of players, and preferred to play the game at a slower tempo, he possessed good acceleration. In Switzerland, the place of origin( literally\" home place\" or\" citizen place\") denotes where a Swiss citizen has their municipal citizenship. It is not to be confused with the place of birth or place of residence, although two or all three of these locations may be identical depending on the person's circumstances. The Ancient Egyptian artisan Sennedjem lived in Set Maat( translated as\" The Place of Truth\"), contemporary Deir el- Medina, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite Thebes, during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II. Sennedjem had the title\" Servant in the Place of Truth\". He was buried along with his wife, Iyneferti, and family in a tomb in the village necropolis. His tomb was discovered January 31, 1886. When Sennedjem's tomb was found, in it there was regular furniture from his home, including a stool and a bed, which he actually used when he was alive. His titles included Servant in the Place of Truth, meaning that he worked on the excavation and decoration of the nearby royal tombs. Menexenus (; Greek: Μενέξενоς) was one of the three sons of Socrates and Xanthippe. His two brothers were Lamprocles and Sophroniscus.  Menexenus is not to be confused with the character of the same name who appears in Plato's dialogues Menexenus and Lysis.  Socrates' sons Menexenus and Sophroniscus were still children at the time of their father's trial and death, one of them small enough to be held in his mother's arms. According to Aristotle, Socrates' descendants all turned out to be unremarkable \"fools and dullards\".\n\n\n== References == Motherland is the place of one's birth, the place of one's ancestors, or the place of origin of an ethnic group.

Specifically, the Apology of Socrates is a defence against the charges of \"corrupting the youth\" and \"not believing in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other daimonia that are novel\" to Athens (24b). Among the primary sources about the trial and death of the philosopher Socrates, the Apology of Socrates is the dialogue that depicts the trial, and is one of four Socratic dialogues, along with Euthyphro, Phaedo, and Crito, through which Plato details the final days of the philosopher Socrates.    The text of  Apology   The Apology of Socrates, by the philosopher Plato (429–347 BC), was one of many explanatory apologia about Socrates's legal defence against accusations of corruption and impiety; most apologia were published in the decade after the Trial of Socrates (399 BC). As such, Plato's Apology of Socrates is an early philosophic defence of Socrates, presented in the form of a Socratic dialogue. Although Aristotle later classified it as a genre of fiction, it is still a useful historical source about Socrates (469–399 BC) the philosopher. Aristotle believed the dialogue, particularly the scene where Socrates questions Meletus, represented a good use of interrogation. Except for Socrates's two dialogues with Meletus, about the nature and logic of his accusations of impiety, the text of the Apology of Socrates is in the first-person perspective and voice of the philosopher Socrates (24d–25d and 26b–27d). Moreover, during the trial, in his speech of self-defence, Socrates twice mentions that Plato is present at the trial (34a and 38b).    Introduction  The Apology of Socrates begins with Socrates addressing the jury of perhaps 500 Athenian men to ask if they have been persuaded by the Orators Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus, who have accused Socrates of corrupting the young people of the city and impiety against the pantheon of Athens. The first sentence of his speech establishes the theme of the dialogue—that philosophy begins with an admission of ignorance. Socrates later clarifies that point of philosophy when he says that whatever wisdom he possesses comes from knowing that he knows nothing (23b, 29b). In the course of the trial, Socrates imitates, parodies, and corrects the Orators, his accusers, and asks the jury to judge him by the truth of his statements, not by his oratorical skill (cf. Lysias XIX 1,2,3; Isaeus X 1; Isocrates XV 79; Aeschines II 24). Socrates says he will not use sophisticated language—carefully arranged ornate words and phrases—but will speak using the common idiom of the Greek language. Socrates says that he will speak in the manner he has used in the agora and at the money tables which he states is his native tongue and the fashion of his country. Although offered the opportunity to appease the prejudices of the jury, with a minimal concession to the charges of corruption and impiety, Socrates does not yield his integrity to avoid the penalty of death. The jury condemns Socrates to death.    Accusers of Socrates  In the society of 5th-century BC Athens, the three men who formally accused the philosopher Socrates of impiety and corruption against the people and the city, officially represented the interests of the politicians and the craftsmen, of the scholars, poets, and rhetoricians. The accusers of Socrates were:  Anytus, a rich and socially prominent Athenian who opposed the Sophists on principle. Socrates says that Anytus joined the prosecution because he was \"vexed on behalf of the craftsmen and politicians\" (23e–24a); moreover, Anytus appears in the Meno dialogue (90f). Whilst Socrates and Meno (a visitor to Athens) are discussing Virtue, Anytus unexpectedly appears before them, and overhears their conversation. From the philosophic stance that virtue cannot be taught, Socrates adduces that many socially prominent Athenians have produced sons who are inferior to themselves, as fathers; Socrates names several such men, including Pericles and Thucydides. The Trial of Socrates (399 BC) was held to determine the philosopher's guilt of two charges: asebeia (impiety) against the pantheon of Athens, and corruption of the youth of the city-state; the accusers cited two impious acts by Socrates: \"failing to acknowledge the gods that the city acknowledges\" and \"introducing new deities\". The death sentence of Socrates was the legal consequence of asking politico-philosophic questions of his students, which resulted in the two accusations of moral corruption and impiety. At trial, the majority of the dikasts (male-citizen jurors chosen by lot) voted to convict him of the two charges; then, consistent with common legal practice voted to determine his punishment and agreed to a sentence of death to be executed by Socrates's drinking a poisonous beverage of hemlock. Primary-source accounts of the trial and execution of Socrates are the Apology of Socrates by Plato and the Apology of Socrates to the Jury  by Xenophon of Athens, both of whom had been his students; modern interpretations include The Trial of Socrates (1988) by the journalist I. F. Stone, Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths (2009) by the Classics scholar Robin Waterfield, and The Shadows of Socrates: The Heresy, War, and Treachery behind the Trial of Socrates (2024) by the scholar Matt Gatton.    Background   Before the philosopher Socrates was tried for moral corruption and impiety, the citizens of Athens knew him as an intellectual and moral gadfly of their society. In the comic play, The Clouds (423 BC), Aristophanes represents Socrates as a sophistic philosopher who teaches the young man Pheidippides how to formulate arguments that justify striking and beating his father. Despite Socrates denying he had any relation with the Sophists, the playwright indicates that Athenians associated the philosophic teachings of Socrates with Sophism. As philosophers, the Sophists were men of ambiguous reputation, \"they were a set of charlatans that appeared in Greece in the fifth century BC, and earned ample livelihood by imposing on public credulity: professing to teach virtue, they really taught the art of fallacious discourse, and meanwhile propagated immoral practical doctrines.\" Besides The Clouds, the comic play The Wasps (422 BC) also depicts inter-generational conflict, between an older man and a young man. Such representations of inter-generational social conflict among the men of Athens, especially in the decade from 425 to 415 BC, can reflect contrasting positions regarding opposition to or support for the Athenian invasion of Sicily. Many Athenians blamed the teachings of the Sophists and of Socrates for instilling the younger generation with a morally nihilistic, disrespectful attitude towards their society. Socrates left no written works; however, his student and friend, Plato, wrote Socratic dialogues, featuring Socrates as the protagonist. As a teacher, competitor intellectuals resented Socrates's elenctic examination method for intellectual inquiry, because its questions threatened their credibility as men of wisdom and virtue. It has sometimes been claimed that Socrates described himself as the \"gadfly\" of Athens which, like a sluggish horse, needed to be aroused by his \"stinging\".  In the Greek text of his defense given by Plato, Socrates never actually uses that term (viz., \"gadfly\" [Grk., oîstros]) to describe himself.  Rather, his reference is merely allusive, as he (literally) says only that he has attached himself to the City (proskeimenon tē polei) in order to sting it.  Nevertheless, he does make the bold claim that he is a god's gift to the Athenians. Socrates's elenctic method was often imitated by the young men of Athens.    Association with Alcibiades and the Thirty Tyrants  Alcibiades was an Athenian general who had been the main proponent of the disastrous Sicilian Expedition during the Peloponnesian Wars, where virtually the entire Athenian invading force of more than 50,000 soldiers and non-combatants (e.g., the rowers of the Triremes) was killed or captured and enslaved. He was a student and close friend of Socrates, and his messmate during the siege of Potidaea (433–429 BC). Socrates remained Alcibiades's close friend, admirer, and mentor for about five or six years. During his career, Alcibiades famously defected to Sparta, arch-enemy of Athens, after being summoned to trial, then to Persia after being caught in an affair with the wife of his benefactor (the King of Sparta).\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Antonio Maceo Airport is an international airport located in Santiago, Cuba. Kagawa Prefecture (香川県, Kagawa-ken) is a prefecture of Japan located on the island of Shikoku. Kagawa Prefecture has a population of 949,358 (as of 2020) and is the smallest prefecture by geographic area at 1,877 square kilometres (725 sq mi). Kagawa Prefecture borders Ehime Prefecture to the southwest and Tokushima Prefecture to the south. Takamatsu is the capital and largest city of Kagawa Prefecture, with other major cities including Marugame, Mitoyo, and Kan'onji. Kagawa Prefecture is located on the Seto Inland Sea across from Okayama Prefecture on the island of Honshu, which is connected by the Great Seto Bridge. Kagawa Prefecture includes Shōdoshima, the second-largest island in the Seto Inland Sea, and the prefecture's southern land border with Tokushima Prefecture is formed by the Sanuki Mountains.    History   Kagawa was formerly known as Sanuki Province. For a brief period between August 1876 and December 1888, Kagawa was made a part of Ehime Prefecture.    Battle of Yashima  Located in Kagawa's capital city, Takamatsu, the mountain of Yashima was the battlefield for one of the best-known struggles between the Heike and Genji clans.    Geography  Kagawa comprises the northeast corner of Shikoku, bordering Ehime Prefecture on the west and Tokushima Prefecture on the south, with a coastline on the Seto Inland Sea facing Okayama Prefecture and the Kansai. The Sanuki Mountains run along the southern border. Kagawa is currently the smallest prefecture, by area, in Japan. Kagawa is a relatively narrow prefecture located between the mountains of Shikoku and the sea. As of April 1, 2012, 11% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely Setonaikai National Park and Ōtaki-Ōkawa Prefectural Natural Park.    Cities   Eight cities are located in Kagawa Prefecture:    Towns  Kagawa has eight towns organized into five districts. Many were created after 1999 through mergers, as part of a national effort to reduce the number of small towns and villages.     Mergers     Economy  Kagawa has a nominal GDP of approximately 3,802 billion yen. Kagawa's major export industries, in order of export value, include transportation equipment, electrical equipment, chemical products, general machinery, mineral fuels, manufactured goods, raw materials, and foodstuff.    Foods   Sanuki udon (a type of udon noodle) is the most famous local food of Kagawa Prefecture. In 2008, there were over 700 udon restaurants in this prefecture alone. Aside from udon, Kagawa is also famous for \"hone-tsuki-dori\", seasoned chicken thigh cooked on the bone. Originating from Marugame City, the dish has now become a popular dish in izakaya restaurants across the country. Olives and olive-related products have also come to be recognized as Kagawa foods. As the first place in Japan to successfully cultivate olives, Kagawa has been producing olive-related products since 1908. As well as winning both domestic and international awards for the quality of its olive oil, Kagawa has also created two offshoot food brands from its olive industry - \"olive beef\" and \"olive yellowtail\". Waste organic matter from olive pressing is used as feed for cattle and the Yellowtail Amberjack. Due to the high amount of polyphenols in the olive waste, the flesh of the respective meats does not oxidize or lose color easily. Other local specialties include wasanbon sugar sweets, sōmen noodles and shōyu soy sauce. Rare sugar researches are thriving and have discovered mass production culture enzymes. D-tagatose 3-epimerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible epimerization reaction of the 3rd carbon of ketose.    Demographics   As of October 2020, Kagawa Prefecture had an estimated population of 950,244. This was .54% lower than the population in the 2000 census, being 1,022,890. Ayapel Airport is an airport located in Ayapel, Colombia. Freehold is a borough in and the county seat of Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Known for its Victorian era homes and extensive colonial history, the borough is located in the Raritan Valley region within the New York Metropolitan Area, located about 33 miles (53 km) from Manhattan and 17 miles (27 km) from Staten Island. The borough has grown to become a commuter town of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 12,538, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 486 (+4.0%) from the 12,052 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,076 (+9.8%) from the 10,976 counted in the 2000 census. The Freeholds region, which includes the borough and Freehold Township (which completely surrounds the borough), is a commercial hub for central New Jersey. The borough is located relatively close to the Raritan Bayshore communities to the north, including The Amboys, Old Bridge, Matawan, Keyport, Keansburg, and Middletown, along with being relatively close to the Tri-City region of Jersey Shore municipalities (and their vicinities) to the east, including Red Bank, Long Branch, and Asbury Park. What is now Freehold Borough was originally incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 25, 1869, from portions within Freehold Township. The town became independent of the township in 1888. On April 15, 1919, Freehold was incorporated as a borough, including all of Freehold and additional portions of Freehold Township, based on the results of a referendum held on July 8, 1919. Additional portions of Freehold Township were annexed on September 7, 1926. The Hispanic and Latino population has been rapidly growing in Freehold Borough for the last 40 years. The Hispanic population making up 4.6% (0.2% Mexican) in the 1980 Census, 11.3% (2.8% Mexican) in the 1990 Census, 28.0% (17.3% Mexican) in 2000, 42.9% (29.6% Mexican) in 2010, and recently in 2020, a majority at 53.0% Hispanic. Meanwhile, the Black or African American population has decreased in recent decades: 17.1% in 1970, 19.8% in 1980, 18.2% in 1990, 15.8% in 2000, 12.6% in 2010 and 9.4% in 2020. In 2021, Freehold Borough became one of few towns in the state (including, Bellmawr, Egg Harbor Township, Montclair and Woodbridge Township) that has authorized the sale of cannabis through authorized dispensaries and for the allowance of cultivators, distributors, wholesalers, and manufacturers.    History     Early history  The Lenni Lenape Native Americans were the earliest known people to live in the area that became Freehold. The Lenape were a hunter-gatherer society. They were largely sedentary, changing campsites seasonally. They were prolific hunters of small game and birds. They were also skilled fisherman, and were known to harvest vast amounts of clams from the bays and inlets on the Jersey Shore. They also practiced some agriculture to augment their food supply. During this time, an important crossroad of two major Lenape trails was located in the area of Freehold. By the late 17th century, the English had begun to take over the area. In 1664, the Duke of York (later James II & VII) granted a patent to Sir George Carteret to develop the area. In 1685, Scottish Presbyterians from Scotland, along with English Baptists and Quakers from New England fleeing religious persecution at home, became the first to settle within the area. In 1693, along with Middletown and Shrewsbury, Freehold was established by act of legislature as one of the three original townships in Monmouth County. The name of the borough comes from the word Freehold, an English legal term describing fee simple property ownership.    Colonial Freehold   In 1714, when the colonial government was deciding where to locate the county seat and courthouse, Freeholder John Reid, the first Surveyor General of East Jersey, wanted the county seat located in Freehold Township. Reid sold land suitable for use as a courthouse to the Board of Chosen Freeholders at a bargain price, and this may have been the deciding factor why Freehold was selected over Middletown and Shrewsbury. Erzincan Airport is an airport located in Erzincan, Turkey. Esquimalt Airport was an airport located in Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada. Freehold is a hamlet in the town of Greenville in Greene County, New York, United States. It has the ZIP Code 12431, and its own fire district.\nThe hamlet is centered on the junction of New York State Route 32 and Greene County Route 67. There are several buildings there, such as the firehouse and a general store. It is located in The Northern Catskill Mountains of Greene County; the range's northern escarpment dominates the view south from Freehold.\nFreehold Airport is located one mile west of the town and is a major hub for gliders.\n\n\n== Notable person ==\nEsbon Blackmar, former US congressman\n\n\n== References == Madang Airport, is an airport located in Madang, Papua New Guinea. Freehold Township is a township in western Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Crisscrossed by several major highways, the township is a commercial hub for Central New Jersey (home to the Freehold Raceway and Freehold Raceway Mall) and is a suburban bedroom community of New York City, located within the Raritan Valley region of the much larger New York Metropolitan Area. The township is located roughly 38 miles (61 km) away from Manhattan and about 20 miles (32 km) away from Staten Island. As of the 2020 United States census, the township's population was 35,369, a decrease of 815 (−2.3%) from the 36,184 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 4,647 (+14.7%) from the 31,537 counted in the 2000 census. Freehold Township was first formed on October 31, 1693, and was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions of Freehold Township were taken to form Upper Freehold Township (c. 1731), so some wills and official records following the split referred to \"Lower Freehold Township\" although the official name has always been Freehold Township. Additional portions formed Millstone Township (February 28, 1844), Jackson Township (March 6, 1844), Atlantic Township (February 18, 1847; now Colts Neck Township), Marlboro Township (February 17, 1848) and Manalapan Township (March 9, 1848). Freehold town was formed within the township on March 25, 1869, and formally separated when it was reconstituted as a borough on April 15, 1919, including additional portions of the township. The Battle of Monmouth was fought in June 1778 in what has been preserved as Monmouth Battlefield State Park, which is in Freehold Township and Manalapan Township.    History     Early  The Lenni Lenape Native Americans were the earliest known people to live in the area that became Freehold. The Lenape were a hunter-gatherer society. They were largely sedentary, changing campsites seasonally. They were prolific hunters of small game and birds. They were also skilled fisherman, and were known to harvest vast amounts of clams from the bays and inlets on the Jersey Shore. They also practiced some agriculture to augment their food supply. During this time, an important crossroad of two major Lenape trails was located in the area of Freehold. In 1498, John Cabot became the first European to sight this land. By the late 17th century, the English had begun to take over the area. In 1664, the Duke of York (later James II & VII) granted a patent to Sir George Carteret to develop the area. In 1685, Scottish Presbyterians from Scotland, along with English Baptists and Quakers from New England fleeing religious persecution at home, became the first to settle within the area. In 1693, along with Middletown and Shrewsbury, Freehold was established by act of legislature as one of the three original townships in Monmouth County. The name of the township comes from the word freehold, an English legal term describing fee simple property ownership.    Colonial  In 1714, when the colonial government was deciding where to locate the county seat and courthouse, Freeholder John Reid, the first Surveyor General of East Jersey, wanted the county seat located in Freehold. Reid's offer to sell the property to the Board of Chosen Freeholders at a heavily discounted price may have been the deciding factor in choosing Freehold—rather than Middletown or Shrewsbury—as the site of the county seat. As part of the deal, Reid placed a restrictive covenant in the deed that, should the property ever cease being used as a courthouse, ownership would revert to the Reid family. Direct descendants of John Reid still reside in Freehold Township.  Freehold was officially designated as the seat of the Monmouth County government, and a court house was commissioned to be built on the land purchased from John Reid. The Monmouth Courthouse opened in 1715. A small village quickly began to develop around the courthouse. At first, the village was called Monmouth Courthouse. Over time, other government buildings opened near the courthouse, including a sheriff's office, a prison, and a post office. A number of homes and commercial businesses also sprang up in the village, including a blacksmith, a general store, a bank, a hotel, and saloon.  In the area surrounding Monmouth Courthouse, many successful farms began to appear. It is equipped with an Instrument Landing System, VHF Omni-directional Radio Range, Distance Measuring Equipment, Airport Surveillance Radar, approach lights, precision approach angle guidance lights, and more. On January 16, 2013, an All Nippon Airways Boeing 787( Flight NH692) made an emergency landing at Takamatsu after reporting a battery problem in flight.

As of 1 November 2022, the city had an estimated population of 414,134 in 190,120 households and a population density of 1,100 persons per km2. The total area of the city is 375.41 square kilometres (144.95 sq mi). It is the capital city of the prefecture.    Geography  Takamatsu is located in central Kagawa Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. The city is located in the Takamatsu Plain, which is part of the Sanuki Plain, and is occupied by a gentle slope as a whole. The northern part faces the Seto Inland Sea, forming a semicircular urban area centered on Takamatsu Port and Takamatsu New Port (commonly known as Shinminato).The western part of the city consists of an alluvial fan formed by the sedimentation of the Koto River. The eastern part is a flooded plain formed by the Kasuga River and Shinkawa River. In the northeastern part of the island, there is Yashima, a table-shaped plateau protruding into the Seto Inland Sea, which was the site of the Battle of Yashima in the Genpei War, and Cape Takei, the northernmost tip of the main island of Shikoku. Parts of the city are located within the borders of the Setonaikai National Park. The city area also includes a number of small inhabited islands in the Seto Inland Sea.    Neighbouring municipalities  Kagawa Prefecture  Sakaide Sanuki Miki Ayagawa  Honnō Tokushima Prefecture  Mima    Climate  Takamatsu has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa) with hot, humid summers, and cool winters. Some rain falls throughout the year, but the months from May to September have the heaviest rain.    Demographics  Per Japanese census data, the population of Takamatsu in 2020 is 417,496 people. Takamatsu has been conducting censuses since 1920.    History  The area of Takamatsu was part of ancient Sanuki Province. During the Heian and Kamakura period, as the closest port to Honshu from Shikoku island, the area was a transportation center and gateway for pilgrims to the Kotohira Shrine. During the Sengoku period, Ikoma Chikamasa suit the first Takamatsu Castle in 1588. In 1642, Matsudaira Yorishige, the son of Tokugawa Yorifusa of Mito Domain and grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu, was awarded the 120,000 koku Takamatsu Domain, which his descendants would continue to rule until the Meiji restoration. Following the Meiji restoration, the city of Takamatsu was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on February 15, 1890. The castle tower formerly used as the symbol of the city was destroyed during the Meiji period.  The city borders expanded in several iterations by the annexation on neighboring villages and towns. During World War II, Takamatsu was selected as a target by the United States' XXI Bomber Command because the city was an important focal point of Shikoku's rail and road transit systems, and containing some industry vital to supporting the war effort. On July 3, 1945, at 6:40 PM (JST) 128 B-29 Superfortress bombers dropped over 800 tons of incendiary bombs on Takamatsu, destroying 78% of the built-up areas of the city and killing 1359 people. The city quickly recovered after the war, and its borders continued to expand. On April 1, 1999 it was designated a core city with increased local autonomy. On September 26, 2005, the town of Shionoe (from Kagawa District) was merged into Takamatsu. On January 10, 2006, Takamatsu absorbed the following towns: Aji and Mure (from Kita District), Kagawa and Kōnan (from Kagawa District), and Kokubunji (from Ayauta District).    Government  Takamatsu has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 40 members. Takamatsu contributes 15 members to the Kagawa Prefectural Assembly. This is a list of airports in New York (a U.S. state), grouped by type and sorted by location.

As of February 2012, the country has a total of 98 airports, of which 28 are operated by the central government and 67 by local governments.\n\n\n== Airport classifications ==\nIn Japan, airports serving civil aviation routes are governed by the Aeronautical Law for safety purposes, by the Noise Prevention Law for noise prevention purposes and by the Airport Act for economic development purposes. The latter law groups such airports into four legal classifications:\n\nHub/First Class airports (拠点空港) serve a hub role in domestic or international transportation. They are subdivided into privately managed airports (the three largest international airports), national airports (run by the central government) and special regional airports (hubs run by prefectural or municipal governments).\nRegional/Second Class airports (地方管理空港) are other prefectural/municipal airports that the central government deems important to national aviation.\nJoint-use/Third Class airports (共用空港) are those shared between civil aviation and the Japan Self-Defense Forces.\nOther airports (その他の空港) fall outside the above categories.\nSome airports in Japan do not fall under the scope of the Japanese airport statutes. These include the three major U.S. military air bases in Japan (Kadena Air Base, MCAS Iwakuni and Yokota Air Base) and certain smaller aerodromes for firefighting, corporate or other special purposes. In 2001, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which receives 20% of the public-works construction budget, commenced a scheme to build airfields predominantly for airlifting vegetables. Kasaoka Airfield was one of nine airfields constructed; however it was later determined that flying vegetables to Okayama from Kasaoka took just as long due to loading and unloading, and cost approximately six times as much as road transport.\n\n\n== Airports ==\n\n\n== Heliports ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the busiest airports in Japan\nJapan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF)\nJapan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF)\nJapan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF)\nTransport in Japan\nList of airports by ICAO code: R#RJ RO – Japan\nWikipedia:WikiProject Aviation/Airline destination lists: Asia#Japan\n\n\n== References ==\n\n  \nCivil Aviation Bureau: Airports in Japan (map with English text)\n\"ICAO Location Indicators by State\" (PDF).

Shikoku's ancient names include Iyo-no-futana-shima (伊予之二名島), Iyo-shima (伊予島), and Futana-shima (二名島), and its current name refers to the four former provinces that make up the island: Awa, Tosa, Sanuki, and Iyo.    Geography   Shikoku Island, comprising Shikoku and its surrounding islands, covers about 18,800 square kilometres (7,259 sq mi) and consists of four prefectures: Ehime, Kagawa, Kōchi, and Tokushima. Across the Seto Inland Sea lie Wakayama, Osaka, Hyōgo, Okayama, Hiroshima, and Yamaguchi Prefectures on Honshu. To the west lie Ōita and Miyazaki Prefectures on Kyushu.  Shikoku is ranked as the 50th largest island by area in the world. Additionally, it is ranked as the 23rd most populated island in the world, with a population density of 193 inhabitants per square kilometre (500/sq mi). Mountains running east and west divide Shikoku into a narrow northern subregion, fronting on the Seto Inland Sea, and a southern part facing the Pacific Ocean. The Hydrangea hirta species can be found in these mountain ranges. Most of the 3.8 million inhabitants live in the north, and all but one of the island's few larger cities are located there. Mount Ishizuchi (石鎚山) in Ehime at 1,982 m (6,503 ft) is the highest mountain on the island. Industry is moderately well developed and includes the processing of ores from the important Besshi copper mine. Land is used intensively. Wide alluvial areas, especially in the eastern part of the zone, are planted with rice and subsequently are double-cropped with winter wheat and barley. Fruit is grown throughout the northern area in great variety, including citrus fruits, persimmons, peaches, and grapes. Because of wheat production, Sanuki udon (讃岐うどん) became an important part of the diet in Kagawa Prefecture (formerly Sanuki Province) in the Edo period. The larger southern area of Shikoku is mountainous and sparsely populated. The only significant lowland is a small alluvial plain at Kōchi, the prefectural capital. The area's mild winters stimulated some truck farming, specializing in growing out-of-season vegetables under plastic covering. Two crops of rice can be cultivated annually in the southern area. The pulp and paper industry took advantage of the abundant forests and hydroelectric power. The major river in Shikoku is the Yoshino River. It runs 196 km (121.8 mi) from its source close to Mount Ishizuchi, flowing basically west to east across the northern boundaries of Kōchi and Tokushima Prefectures, reaching the sea at the city of Tokushima. The Yoshino is famous for Japan's best white-water rafting, with trips going along the Oboke Koboke sections of the river. Shikoku has four important capes: Gamōda in Anan, Tokushima on the easternmost point on the island, Sada in Ikata, Ehime on the westernmost point. Muroto in Muroto, Kōchi and Ashizuri, the southern extreme of Shikoku, in Tosashimizu, Kōchi, jut into the Pacific Ocean. The island's northernmost point is in Takamatsu. Unlike the other three major islands of Japan, Shikoku has no active volcanoes, and is the largest of Japan's islands to completely lack them. But Shikoku did experience volcanic activity in the distant prehistoric past; a major volcanic caldera in the area of Mount Ishizuchi was active during the Miocene around 14 million years ago and the small volcanic cone of Mount Iino at an unknown date.  \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t    Population  Shikoku has a total population of 3,630,320 in 2022.

Red follows Frank Moses (Willis), a former black-ops agent who reunites with his old team to capture an assassin who has vowed to kill him. The film was released on October 15, 2010. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $199 million worldwide, and also received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. A sequel, Red 2, was released on July 19, 2013. A third film was announced as in-development in 2013 but did not come to fruition.    Plot  Former CIA black ops agent Frank Moses lives a quiet life in the suburbs, and frequently tears up his pension checks in order to talk to call center employee Sarah Ross, with whom he has fallen in love over the phone. One day, an assassination squad attacks Frank at his home, but he single-handedly kills the entire squad. Frank travels to Missouri to rescue Sarah, resorting to kidnapping her when she refuses to come along with him. Meanwhile, young CIA agent William Cooper is tasked by his supervisor Cynthia Wilkes to kill Frank. In New Orleans, Frank ties up Sarah in a motel room while he visits his former mentor Joe at a retirement home for help identifying the squad. Joe's intel reveals that the same squad murdered a New York Times reporter recently. Sarah gets loose and calls 9-1-1, accidentally alerting Cooper to her location. Frank saves her from one of Cooper's agents and the pair narrowly avoid Cooper in a car chase. In New York, they speak with the reporter's mother and find a list of names the reporter was investigating, including Frank's, almost all of whom recently died. Meanwhile, Joe's room is infiltrated by a hitman, leaving Frank devastated. Frank and Sarah track down retired agent Marvin Boggs in Florida, whose name is on the list. He finds that all the names on the list were part of a series of killings in Guatemala in 1981 that they were a part of. The three track down pilot Gabriel Singer, who flew the mission, but he is killed by a sniper before he can give any valuable information. After they escape, Frank secures the help of retired FSB agent Ivan Simanov in exchange for a favor, and with Sarah infiltrates the Secure Records Vault at the CIA's headquarters in Virginia to obtain the Guatemala file. Frank runs into Cooper in his office and they fight; he dislocates Cooper's shoulder and Cooper shoots and wounds Frank. Frank and Sarah are picked up by Marvin and Joe, who survived the assassination. The four seek help from retired British assassin Victoria Winslow, who stitches Frank's wound and joins them as they decide to meet with Alexander Dunning, an arms dealer who is the only name left on the list still alive aside from Frank and Marvin. Joe, Frank and Marvin interrogate Dunning at his home, where he reveals that the killings were ordered by the Vice President of the US, Robert Stanton, in order to cover up Stanton's mass killing of innocent villagers in Guatemala. Meanwhile, Cooper receives a tip that leads him to Dunning's mansion. Joe sacrifices his life to help Frank and Marvin escape. The two and Victoria are extracted by Ivan, but Sarah is captured by Cooper's men. Later, Frank breaks into Cooper's house and calls him, revealing that he intends to kill Stanton, and that if Sarah is harmed, he will kill Cooper's family as well. Finding the Guatemala file Frank left for him at his house, Cooper realizes that he is being used in the coverup and has himself assigned to Stanton's security detail.  The remaining group kidnaps Stanton from a fundraising dinner with the help of Ivan. Frank calls Cooper and arranges to trade Stanton for Sarah. Cooper arrives alone and Cynthia brings Sarah, as well as Dunning, who shoots Stanton and reveals himself and Cynthia to be behind the assassinations. He demands Frank drop his gun and orders Cooper to detain Frank, offering to make him CIA Director if he kills him and Sarah. Cooper instead gives Frank the keys to his handcuffs and kills Cynthia. Marvin and Victoria kill Dunning's bodyguards, and Frank and Marvin kill Dunning. Cooper then lets Frank and everyone else leave, staying behind to clean up after them and take care of the rest of the situation. The group leaves in Ivan's car and Ivan cashes in his favor from Frank; a problem needs to be resolved in Moldova.

Road Kill, known as Road Train in Australia, is a 2010 Australian horror film directed by Dean Francis and written by Clive Hopkins. It stars Xavier Samuel, Bobby Morley, Georgina Haig and Sophie Lowe.    Plot  Marcus (Xavier Samuel), his best friend Craig (Bobby Morley), and their friends, Liz (Georgina Haig) and Nina (Sophie Lowe) are driving through the Australian outback. Craig and Nina made love with each other in the tent during morning, when Liz tried to make out with Marcus, but it is revealed Marcus have erectile disfunction. A road train comes up behind their Jeep Cherokee and pushes them off the road, breaking Craig's arm. The truck stops some distance up the road. The group approaches it, but the driver is nowhere to be found. Distant gunshots are heard, and a crazed figure in the bush screams and runs towards them. Panicked, they commandeer the truck and drive away. The truck's radio turns on by itself. After all four fall asleep, the truck drives itself off the road and up a hill. When they wake up, Nina looks after Craig while Liz leaves to search for a shack she's seen. Unable to start the truck, Marcus accompanies Liz. Nina discovers the truck's fuel tanks are empty, but finds a large pipe underneath the trailer, filled with a mysterious red fluid. Craig, tormented by visions of the hellhound Cerberus, finds a key to the trailers. He opens and enters the rearmost trailer, only for the door to close itself behind him. Marcus and Liz have an argument over her having slept with Craig, causing Liz to storm off. Marcus stays on the road and has a run-in with the truck's driver, who shoots himself. Liz locates the rundown shack, where she finds unlabeled cans containing the red fluid. Thirsty, she drinks some but quickly runs back to the truck after finding bloody remains. Liz and Nina try to start the truck, but Marcus, now bearing the driver's clothes and gun, tries to destroy it. The women overpower and tie him up. Craig emerges from the trailer and kills Marcus. The truck starts up again, and Nina tries to back it up. Liz stands at the rear to signal Nina, but eventually leaves to drink more red fluid. Nina, unable to see Liz, exits the cab and sees Craig, who tries to lure her into the rear trailer. Hearing Liz crying for help from inside, she pushes Craig in and locks the door. Eventually, after Nina turns the truck around, she stops and examines the front trailer. To her horror, she discovers it is an abattoir where human bodies, including Marcus's, are ground into the red fluid that fuels the truck. Shocked, she returns to the cab and keeps driving. Nina spots a car and signals them for help. The truck radio turns on again, distracting Nina long enough to allow Craig and Liz to break into the cab. As the three fight, Craig rams the truck into the car. Liz is thrown from the cab by Nina, who is then knocked out. When Nina awakens, she finds Craig dragging Liz's body to the trailer. He tries to persuade her to help, rambling of a \"magnificent opportunity\". Nina instead flees, but Craig slams her head on the side of the cab. He drags her into the trailer, but she manages to defend herself and flees into the bush. Craig pursues and catches Nina, but she kills him with the truck driver's gun. As Nina emerges from the bush, she spots the couple from the wrecked car examining the truck. She runs toward them, screaming warnings. The couple, having been run off the road, hearing distant gunshots, and seeing a screaming figure running towards them, commandeer the truck and drive off, leaving Nina to watch in horror as the bloody cycle repeats itself.

The Road is a 2009 American post-apocalyptic survival film directed by John Hillcoat and written by Joe Penhall, based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. The film stars Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee as a father and his son in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The film received a limited release in North American cinemas from November 25, 2009, and was released in United Kingdom cinemas on January 4, 2010. It received generally positive reviews from critics; the performances of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee garnered praise. It also received numerous nominations, including a BAFTA nomination for Best Cinematography.    Plot  A man and his young son struggle to survive after an unspecified catastrophe results in an extinction event which causes the death of all plant life and virtually all animal life. The man and boy travel on a road to the coast in hope that they can find safe haven, scavenging for supplies in their journey, and avoiding roaming cannibalistic rape gangs armed with guns. Years earlier, the man's wife gives birth to their son shortly after the catastrophe and she gradually loses hope. When the man shoots an intruder using one of three bullets they have saved for their family as a last resort, she accuses him of wasting the bullet deliberately to prevent her suicide. Removing her coat and hat in the freezing cold, she walks into the woods, never to be seen again. In the present, after shooting a member of a gang of cannibals who stumbles upon them, the man is left with only one bullet. Exploring a mansion, he and the boy discover people locked in the basement, imprisoned as food for their captors. When the cannibals return, the man and his son hide. With discovery imminent, the man prepares to shoot his son, but they flee when the cannibals are distracted by the escaping captives. Further down the road, the man and boy discover an underground shelter full of canned food and supplies. They feast and bathe. When they hear noises above, including a dog, the man decides it is too dangerous to remain and they move on. They meet a near-blind old man, and the son persuades the father to share food with him. At the coast, the man leaves the boy to guard their possessions while he swims out to scavenge a beached ship. The boy falls asleep and their supplies are stolen. The man chases down the thief and takes everything from him, even his clothes. This distresses the boy so much the man turns back and leaves the clothes and a can of food for the thief. As they pass through a ruined town, the man is shot in the leg with an arrow. He kills his ambusher with a flare gun he found on the ship and finds the archer's female companion in the same room. The man thinks the archer and woman were following them, but she claims it was the other way around. He leaves her weeping over the body. Weakened, the man and boy abandon their cart and most of their possessions. The man's condition deteriorates and eventually, he dies. The boy is approached by a man with his wife, two children, and dog. The wife explains they have been following the boy and his father for some time and were worried about him. The father convinces the boy he is one of the \"good guys\" and takes him under his protection.    Cast  In the film, only one of the characters (the old man) is given a name, Ely. The credits give their roles in place of names.  Viggo Mortensen as Man Kodi Smit-McPhee as Boy Charlize Theron as Woman, the man's wife (appearing in a series of flashbacks). Theron was a fan of the book and had worked with producer Nick Wechsler on the 2000 film The Yards. The woman has a larger role in the film than in the book, with Hillcoat stating \"I think it's fine to depart from the book as long as you maintain the spirit of it.\" Robert Duvall as Ely the Old Man Guy Pearce as Veteran, a father wandering with his family Molly Parker as Motherly Woman, the Veteran's wife Michael K. Williams as Thief Garret Dillahunt as Gang Member    Production   In November 2006, producer Nick Wechsler used independent financing to acquire the film rights to adapt the 2006 novel The Road by Cormac McCarthy. When Wechsler had watched John Hillcoat's 2005 film The Proposition after reading The Road, the producer decided to pursue Hillcoat to direct the film adaptation. Devil is a 2010 American supernatural horror film directed by John Erick Dowdle. The screenplay by Brian Nelson was from a story by M. Night Shyamalan. Starring Chris Messina, Logan Marshall-Green, Geoffrey Arend, Bojana Novakovic, Jenny O'Hara, and Bokeem Woodbine, the film revolves around five strangers who become trapped in an elevator. Devil was released on September 17, 2010. Critics praised the film's atmosphere and performances, but criticized the short running-time.    Plot   A Bible verse from 1 Peter 5:8 appears onscreen: \"Be sober, be vigilant: Because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.\" A narrator (later revealed to be Ramirez) relates a story about his childhood, where his mother would explain to him and his siblings the circumstances that surround The Devil roaming the Earth, searching for the souls of unrepentant people to take to Hell. A man jumps to his death from a Philadelphia skyscraper, leaving a suicide note about the Devil's approaching presence. Shortly thereafter, an elevator in the same skyscraper gets stuck with five people inside: a temporary security guard, a mechanic/former Marine, a mattress salesman, a young woman, and an elderly woman. A repairman cannot get the elevator working and nearly dies while attempting to do so. In the elevator, the lights frequently flicker and turn off completely for intervals. During an interval, one of the security guards, Ramirez, watching through the security camera, sees a face on the monitor he believes is the Devil, but his partner Lustig doubts it. At the same time, the young woman feels something on her back and the group becomes suspicious of the mattress salesman. When the lights return, the young woman has a bite mark on her back and the salesman has blood on his hands. Detective Bowden, who was investigating the earlier suicide, is called to the scene. The lights go out again, and the elevator mirrors break. When the lights return, the mattress salesman's jugular vein is impaled with a broken mirror shard and he dies, escalating it into a crime scene investigation. Outside, security guards, the repair technician, and the fire department attempt to get in, to no avail. The passengers begin to suspect each other, while the security guards monitoring through the camera talk to them one-way via the speaker, as they cannot hear the passengers. As the group argues, the repair technician's rappelling device breaks and he falls to his death on top of the elevator, terrifying the occupants. Ramirez unsuccessfully tries to convince the detectives that this could be \"The Devil's Meeting\". An unknown woman attempts to enter the building but is barred, and she goes around to the back. Bowden and his partner use the sign-in sheet and elevator camera to identify the group. The temporary guard is identified as Ben Larson, who has a criminal record of assault and beating someone into a coma. The mattress salesman is identified as Vince McCormick, who lost many people their assets through a Ponzi scheme. The young woman is identified as Sarah Caraway, who is married to a rich man and plans on leaving him after stealing his money, as she has done before. The elderly woman is identified as Jane Kowski, who was caught on the lobby security camera stealing a woman's wallet. The mechanic and former Marine cannot be identified due to him not signing in, making him the main suspect. Upon review of security footage, the detectives see the mechanic had entered the building with a bag he does not have anymore. They find the bag filled with tools hidden in the lobby bathroom and suspect him more. Suddenly, the lights in the elevator flicker and shut off a fourth time. When they turn back on, the older woman is seen hanging from the ceiling by her neck via a light cable. Ramirez shows Bowden the devil face he saw earlier, but Bowden does not believe him. He tells Ramirez that humans don't need a devil to force them to do bad things, because we are capable of that on our own. He then discusses the death of his wife and son who were killed in a hit-and-run five years prior on Bethlehem Pike Road. He says the driver was never caught, and sarcastically says that it's ok because they left a note that read \"I'm so sorry\" at the scene. Bowden shows Ramirez the note, which is written on a car wash coupon. Ben and the Marine get in a fight, each suspecting the other as the killer. Sarah tells Ben to kill the Marine before he kills them and Ben attacks the Marine. Bowden comes back to the control room and defuses the situation by having the passengers put their hands on the wall. Out of answers, Bowden asks Ramirez how to save them, if the Devil is truly there. Ramirez responds, \"They all die.\"  Lustig goes into the basement to shut off the power where the firefighters are drilling into the wall. The dean of the College of Cardinals (Latin: Decanus Collegii Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalium) presides over the College of Cardinals in the Catholic Church, serving as primus inter pares (first among equals). The position was established in the 12th century. He always holds the rank of a cardinal bishop, and is assisted by a vice-dean. Both are elected by and from the cardinal bishops who are not Eastern Catholic patriarchs, with their election subject to papal confirmation. Except for presiding over the college, the dean and vice-dean have no power over the other cardinals. In the order of precedence in the Catholic Church, the dean and vice-dean, as the two most senior cardinals, are placed second and third, respectively, after the pope. For centuries, the cardinal bishop who had been a bishop of a suburbicarian see the longest was the dean. This custom became a requirement with the canon law of 1917. On 26 February 1965, Pope Paul VI empowered the cardinal bishops to elect the dean from among their number. Both the dean and subdean must reside in Rome. Until December 2019, the dean held the position until death or resignation; there was no mandatory age of retirement. Then, upon accepting Cardinal Angelo Sodano's resignation as dean of the College of Cardinals, Pope Francis established that the dean would henceforth serve a five-year term that may be renewed once. In anticipation of the election of a new dean, Francis said: \"I am hoping they will elect someone who can carry this important responsibility full time.\"    Responsibilities   The dean summons the conclave for the purposes of electing a new pope following a death or resignation. The Dean presides over the daily meetings of the College of Cardinals in advance of the conclave and then presides over the conclave if his age does not prohibit his participation. The dean also has the responsibility of communicating the \"news of the Pope's death to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See and to the Heads of the respective Nations\". He is the public face of the Holy See until a new pope is elected. If he participates in the conclave, the dean asks the pope-elect if he accepts the election, and then asks the new pope what name he wishes to use. If the dean himself is elected pope, the aforementioned tasks are assumed by the sub-dean of the College of Cardinals. If the newly elected pope is not already a bishop, the dean ordains him a bishop. The dean has \"the title of the diocese of Ostia, together with that of any other church to which he already has a title,\" such as his suburbicarian diocese. This has been the case since 1914, by decree of Pope Pius X—previous deans had given up their suburbicarian see and taken the joint title of Ostia and Velletri, which were separated in that same 1914 decree.    Deans elected pope  Nine Deans have been elected pope:   Corrado Demitri, elected in 1153 as Pope Anastasius IV Ubaldo Allucingoli, elected Pope Lucius III in 1181 Ugolino di Conti was elected Pope Gregory IX in 1227 Rinaldo di Jenne was elected Pope Alexander IV in 1254 Pedro Julião was elected Pope John XXI in September 1276 Rodrigo Borgia was elected Pope Alexander VI in 1492 Alessandro Farnese was elected Pope Paul III in 1534 Gian Pietro Carafa was elected Pope Paul IV in May 1555 Joseph Ratzinger was elected Pope Benedict XVI in 2005    List of deans   The following is the list of deans of the Sacred College of Cardinals, separated into three groups to account for the Western Schism, which  ended after the Council of Constance. The earliest attested reference to the \"College of Cardinals\" is at the Council of Reims in 1148.

Karl May film adaptations are films based on stories and characters by German author Karl May (1842–1912). The characters Old Shatterhand, Winnetou, and Kara Ben Nemsi are very famous in Central Europe. In most of the film versions the novels were reworked to a great extent, some movies using only the names of characters invented by Karl May. For example, in the book Der Schatz im Silbersee (The Treasure of Silver Lake) the main character was called \"Old Firehand\" – in the movie he  was renamed \"Old Shatterhand\" (played by American actor Lex Barker) after the more famous character. The movies Old Shatterhand (Apaches' Last Battle) and Winnetou and Old Firehand (Thunder at the Border) are not based on any of May's works, but were completely invented by the screenwriters. Several TV productions, such as Das Buschgespenst and Kara Ben Nemsi Effendi, were much closer to the novels. In foreign distribution, most of the movie titles were not translated directly into the target language, but new movie titles were made up. For American distribution the makers of the movie posters also invented some new color formats such as Flaming Arrow Color for the movie Der Schatz im Silbersee [1] and Apache Color [2] for Winnetou 1. Teil (called Apache Gold in America). The silent movies of the 1920s are now probably lost. For 10 movies in the 1960s, German composer Martin Böttcher wrote landmark film scores, whose success also helped the movies' international success and influenced the Italian movie industry to make Western movies of their own and create a whole new genre, the Spaghetti Western (whose most successful composer Ennio Morricone came to fame just after Martin Böttcher). Michael Herbig's 2001 film Der Schuh des Manitu satirized the Karl May films of the 1960s to great commercial success in Germany.

Diamonds Are Forever is a 1971 spy thriller, the seventh film in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions. It is the sixth and final Eon film to star Sean Connery, who returned to the role as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, having declined to reprise his role in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). The film is based on Ian Fleming's 1956 novel of the same name and is the second of four James Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton. The story has Bond impersonating a diamond smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring and soon uncovering a plot by his old enemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld to use the diamonds to build a space-based laser weapon. Bond has to battle his enemy one last time to stop the smuggling and Blofeld's plan of destroying Washington, D.C. and extorting the world with nuclear supremacy. After George Lazenby left the series, producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli tested other actors, but studio United Artists wanted Connery back, paying a then-record $1.25 million salary for him to return. The producers were inspired by Goldfinger; as with that film, Guy Hamilton was hired to direct, and Shirley Bassey performed vocals on the title theme song. Locations included Las Vegas, California, and Amsterdam. Diamonds Are Forever was a commercial success and received positive reviews, though some of the humor has become controversial in retrospect. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.    Plot  Pursuing Ernst Stavro Blofeld to avenge his wife's murder, James Bond – agent 007 – finds him at a facility where Blofeld lookalikes are being created through plastic surgery. Bond kills a test subject, and later the \"real\" Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud. While offbeat assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd kill several people in a diamond-smuggling delivery chain, M suspects that South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping, and assigns Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Impersonating smuggler Peter Franks, Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it seem like Franks is Bond. Tiffany and Bond go to Los Angeles, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks's corpse. At the airport, Bond meets his CIA ally Felix Leiter who is disguised as a customs inspector, then travels to Las Vegas. At a funeral home involved in the smuggling ring, Franks's body is cremated and the diamonds are passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. The funeral home operator double crosses Bond, and Wint and Kidd try to cremate Bond alive. However, Tree stops the process after discovering the diamonds in Franks's body were fake, planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond tells Leiter to ship the real diamonds. At the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, Tree works as a stand-up comedian. There, Tree is killed by Wint and Kidd, who do not know the diamonds were fake. At the craps table Bond meets Plenty O'Toole, and brings her to his room later. Slumber's henchmen ambush them, throwing O'Toole out the window and into the pool far below. Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany, instructing her to retrieve the diamonds at the Circus Circus casino. Tiffany reneges on her deal and flees, passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where they see the diamonds given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby.  They follow Saxby and witness him rendezvous with a scientist at a Shell station where the diamonds change hands again.  They tail the scientist to a remote research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist. Bond sneaks into the laboratory disguised as one of the employees.  However, after being revealed as an imposter, Bond escapes by stealing a moon buggy and busts his way out of the facility and reunites with Tiffany.  Later in the evening, a spectacular car chase occurs on the streets of Vegas where Bond and Tiffany successfully evade the cops. Bond scales the walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two identical Blofelds, who use an electronic simulator to sound like Whyte when communicating with the outside world. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, who turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, picked up by Wint and Kidd, taken out to Las Vegas Valley, placed in a pipeline and left to die. Ashes and Diamonds( Polish: Popiół i diament) is a 1958 Polish drama film directed by Andrzej Wajda, based on the 1948 novel by Polish writer Jerzy Andrzejewski. Starring Zbigniew Cybulski and Ewa Krzyżewska, it completed Wajda's war films trilogy, following\" A Generation\"( 1954) and\" Kanal\"( 1956). The action of\" Ashes and Diamonds\" takes place in 1945, shortly after World War II. The main protagonist of the film, former Home Army soldier Maciek Chełmicki, is acting in the anti-Communist underground. Maciek receives an order to kill Szczuka, the local secretary of the Polish Workers' Party. Over time, Chełmicki increasingly doubts if his task is worth doing. \" Ashes and Diamonds\", although based on the novel which directly supported the postwar Communist system in Poland, was subtly modified in comparison with the source material. Wajda sympathized with the soldiers of the Polish independence underground; thus, he devoted most of the attention to Chełmicki. During the three- month development of\" Ashes and Diamonds\", the director made drastic changes to the baseline scenario, thanks to his assistant director Janusz Morgenstern, as well as Cybulski, who played the leading role. The film received permission from the authorities to be distributed only through Andrzejewski's intercession. The film did not receive permission to be screened at the main competition at the Cannes Film Festival. However,\" Ashes and Diamonds\" appeared at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI award. At first,\" Ashes and Diamonds\" met positive critical reception, both in Poland and worldwide. However, after the Revolutions of 1989, it was criticized for falsifying the collective memory of Polish partisans. Nevertheless, the film maintained the reputation of one of the most famous Polish motion pictures in history. Reinl is a German language surname. Notable people with the name include:\n\nHarald Reinl (1908–1986), Austrian film director\nJessica Reinl (2001), Irish singer and songwriter\n\n\n== References == Old Shatterhand is a fictional character in Western novels by German writer Karl May (1842–1912). He is the German friend and blood brother of Winnetou, the fictional chief of the Mescalero tribe of the Apache. He is the main character in the Eurowestern by the same name from 1964, starring Lex Barker, as well as in six more films of the Winnetou film series.    Characterisation  Old Shatterhand is the alter ego of Karl May, and May himself maintained that he experienced all the adventures in person, even though in fact he did not visit America until after he wrote most of his well-known Western stories, and never traveled west of Buffalo, NY. Most of the stories are written from a first person perspective, and Winnetou often calls Old Shatterhand my brother Scharli ('Scharli' being a German phonetic approximation of 'Charlie', and ultimately meaning Karl in German). May also wrote stories about the same character traveling the Orient, where he is known as Kara Ben Nemsi. May attached the prefix Old to the names of several of his characters, considering it to be typically American and a sign of the characters' great experience. In the stories, Old Shatterhand is given the name by his friend Sam Hawkens (who also originates from Germany but is already an old-timer in the American West), as Old Shatterhand was able to knock his opponents unconscious with a single punch from his fist aimed at the head (specifically the temple).  Old Shatterhand owns two famous rifles, the Bärentöter (Bear Killer) and the Henrystutzen (Henry carbine), both made by a fictional gunsmith called Henry in St. Louis (based on gunsmith Benjamin Tyler Henry 1821–1898). The Henrystutzen was able to fire 25 shots without reloading, probably a hyperbolic reference to the Henry rifle. Old Shatterhand rode a horse called Hatatitla (Lightning), which he got from Winnetou, who rode the horse's brother, called Iltschi (meaning Wind). The tales may have been an influence on the creation of the Lone Ranger media franchise.

Nevertheless, the film has maintained its reputation as one of the most famous Polish motion pictures in history.    Plot  On 8 May 1945, at the end of World War II, near a small country church, former Home Army soldiers, Maciek, Andrzej and Drewnowski, prepare to assassinate Konrad Szczuka, a political opponent and a secretary of Polish Workers' Party. The ambush fails, as the attackers later learn that they have mistakenly killed two innocents. Andrzej and Maciek's superior, Major Waga, learns of the failed assassination attempt. Waga orders Andrzej and Maciek to attempt the mission for a second time. They come to the Hotel Monopol Restaurant, where a banquet in honour of the victorious war begins, but the combatants do not participate. While sitting in the bar, Maciek and Andrzej listen to the song \"The Red Poppies of Monte Cassino\" and reminisce over their fallen comrades. In honour of them, Maciek lights several glasses of rectified spirit on fire. Their hapless comrade Drewnowski gets drunk at the bar, where he discusses career prospects in postwar Poland with Pieniążek, a representative of the democratic press. During the party, Maciek has a flirtatious conversation with a barwoman named Krystyna and invites her to his room. Afterwards, he goes to his hotel room to check his gun. Krystyna comes to his room after her shift ends. As they lay naked in bed, they realize they are in love, but Krystyna does not want to become attached as Maciek does not plan to stay in town for long. They decide to go for a walk. When it begins to rain, Krystyna and Maciek take shelter in a ruined church. Krystyna notices a poem inscribed on the wall, and Maciek somberly recites it from memory. The lovers say their goodbyes, with Maciek promising to change his situation so he can stay with her. Maciek returns to the bar where he discusses his sense of duty and obligation to the cause with Andrzej. However, Andrzej is unsympathetic to his plight and says Maciek will be a deserter if he does not fulfill his obligation to assassinate Szczuka. Meanwhile, a completely drunk Drewnowski spoils the banquet, covering the other guests with foam from a fire extinguisher, and leaves the ball in shame with his intended career as a Communist functionary in ruins. After the reception, Szczuka learns that his son Marek has been arrested for joining an underground militia. Maciek waits for Szczuka to leave the hotel to meet his captured son, follows him, and shoots him to death. The next morning, Maciek plans to leave Ostrowiec by train. He tells Krystyna of his decision to depart, leaving her heartbroken. The hotel guests dance to a pianist and band playing Chopin's \"Military\" Polonaise in A Major.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Which film has the director who was born later, Glamour Boy (Film) or Night By The Seashore?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nVirke Lehtinen (5 August 1940 – 4 June 2022) was a Finnish film director, film producer, actor and screenwriter. He was also the main owner of Filmiryhmä Oy, a Finnish film production company which started in 1964. Lehtinen's first breakthrough film project was the short film Tori (film) (The Market Place) in 1962. It was the incentive which gave the start for the careers of director Erkko Kivikoski, then 27 and cinematographer Virke Lehtinen, 22, with experienced editor Juho Gartz, then 30. Their film won Silver Bear for Best Short Film of the Berlin International Film Festival. Next year the trio made the feature Kesällä kello 5 (film) (This Summer at Five), which got an enormous popularity and personal awards for the trio and entered 14th Berlin International Film Festival. Kivikoski and Gartz wanted to start a production company of their own, and they wanted Virke Lehtinen along, who had left for Paris. His aim was to study film making and hopefully enter Institut des hautes études cinématographiques (IDHEC). He could however not find the famous film school, but he was lucky to make acquaintance with some excellent film makers. First and foremost Virke Lehtinen appreciated that director Jean-Paul Le Chanois gave the young film maker a great opportunity to accompany his working. This strengthened Lehtinen's professional attitude and his everlasting love for the French art of film making – and above all it made him  understand the warm humanism Le Chanois had. Lehtinen had to return to Helsinki because Kivikoski wanted a third success. The new film was a commercial flop, however. The trio started their common production company. They gave it the name Filmiryhmä Oy (\"Film team\") - because the name depicts their ideals of working as a team, and the name was modern then. Company didn't get any financing for a new feature, and when the trio tried to get financiers for their short films, it was falling into boycott of the big traditional production companies. After one year Kivikoski and Gartz were bored of being producers, thus Virke Lehtinen was forced to stay alone to end a couple of started productions. He made his first short Onninen (film) (Mr Happy (film)) with the very talented and popular actor Leo Jokela in 1968. The script was by Lehtinen and Anssi Mänttäri. Onninen was shown on several festivals. To keep his production company going, Lehtinen made partnerships with some banks and big industrial companies, and started some productions and some long time sponsor relations. He asked his old friend Aito Mäkinen, who ran the Finnish Film Archives (now National Audiovisual Institute (Finland)), to join the company. They produced a big number of shorts, even their first TV-documentary The Berlin Film Festival (documentary). In 1968 Mäkinen directed the first feature of the company Vain neljä kertaa (film), and in 1969 Virke Lehtinen directed in Lapland his first feature Muurahaispolku (\"Path of ants”). It got the Finnish State Film Award. Company started to get fame. It produced shorts and educational films. Their social documentary Silta (film) (\"the Bridge\") was awarded the best European industrial film. They made \"The Finnish way” for Finnair, Marimekko (film) and in Lapland \"Reindeer\", which was awarded in Venice. In 1975 Virke Lehtinen started to prepare a feature to be made in Lapland, ”Fires on the Arctic”. The project was interrupted, when the Filmiryhmä company was offered a location for a cinema. It got the name Diana. Even before its opening Filmiryhmä was in boycott: big cinema companies didn't accept the new player to the market, not even a small art house cinema. Big companies imported traditional films, and they could make agreements with the American distributors, who needed more cinema chains than a single small cinema. Lehtinen and Mäkinen decided to import own films for Diana. Then, the other cinemas around Finland didn't show the films of Diana. Lehtinen and Mäkinen were forced to open other own cinemas, by the names Diana and Amanda. During 15 years Diana imported art house films, cinema classics and modern films. It introduced Finland to new film countries and both established and new directors. There were more than 80 French films, the Japanese film culture was presented with more than 30 films. Totally, the company imported more than 200 films from around the world. Also, they showed every independent Finnish film, even on 16 mm.

Boyle stated that he would like to serve as director, unless Garland chooses to. By July of the same year, Murphy stated that he had recently discussed the possibility of a third film with Boyle; once again expressing interest in reprising his role if Boyle and Garland return to the franchise in their creative roles.

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (WWF/WWE) from 1998 to 2009. He has also worked for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.   During his career in WWF/WWE, Venis held the Intercontinental Championship twice, the European Championship once, and the World Tag Team Championship once with Lance Storm. As the masked Steele, he was the youngest person to win the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship.    Professional wrestling career     Training and early career (1994–1998)  He began his wrestling training in the early 1990s under the tutelage of Jason and Dewey \"The Missing Link\" Robertson and debuted on the Canadian independent circuit before making his way to the international circuit, finding work with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in Japan, Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Promo Azteca, International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) in Mexico, International Wrestling Association (IWA) and World Wrestling Council (WWC)  in Puerto Rico where he was one half of a tag team known as the Canadian Glamour Boys with Shane Sewell they were two time WWC World Tag Team Champions. In Japan, he was known as Sean Morgan as the name Morley was difficult to pronounce due to the lack of phonetic differences between the L and R in Japanese. In Mexico, he adopted a robot-like mask and gimmick, changed his name to Steele, and won the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship.    World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (1998-2009)     European Champion; Intercontinental Champion (1998–2000)  Morley was signed to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1998 and given the gimmick of an adult movie star named \"Val Venis\". The night after WrestleMania XIV, on the March 30 episode of Raw is War, vignettes started to air that showcased Venis' lifestyle on and off the set. The most notable of these aired on May 4 and featured Venis with prominent real-life porn star Jenna Jameson. During this time he worked in dark matches while building up for his debut.  He debuted on the May 18, 1998 episode of Raw, defeating Scorpio. Almost immediately, he was involved in an angle with the Kaientai stable, involving him having an affair with Yamaguchi-San's kayfabe wife, Shian-Li Tsang. As a result, the members of Kaientai had a series of unsuccessful matches against him. Venis made his pay-per-view debut at Fully Loaded: In Your House, defeating Jeff Jarrett. On the August 3 episode of Raw, his tag team partner Taka Michinoku would eventually betray him, which led to him and Kaientai tying Venis up backstage where Yamaguchi-San attempted to castrate him with a sword. The next week, however, he reported that he was saved by \"a little shrinkage\" and help from his friend, John Wayne Bobbitt. He then challenged the four Japanese wrestlers to a match, which they accepted under the conditions that it must be a gauntlet match, meaning that Venis would have to fight all four of them individually in one match. The match ended with Michinoku executing the Michinoku Driver on Venis and getting the three-count, ending his undefeated streak. The feud ended a week later, after Venis fought Michinoku to a no contest.  After feuding with Kaientai, Venis got his first title shot in the WWF at SummerSlam 1998 against European Champion D'Lo Brown for his championship. Venis was disqualified and as a result, Brown retained the title. Venis got involved in a storyline where he slept with other people's wives. He started a feud with Dustin Runnels, on the September 14 episode of Raw when Venis showed Runnels his new porn movie, featuring Venis in bed with Dustin's wife, Terri Runnels. She then became his on-screen girlfriend. This culminated in a match at Breakdown: In Your House, which Venis won. On the October 12 episode of Raw, Venis participated in a tournament for the Intercontinental Championship, defeating Marc Mero in the first round before losing in the semifinals to Ken Shamrock. On the same night, Runnels returned to his Goldust gimmick. Venis continued his feud with Goldust, with Goldust gaining a victory at Judgment Day: In Your House. The two faced each other again at Capital Carnage, and Val went on to win the match, to end the feud. Rumbi Katedza is a Zimbabwean Film Producer and Director who was born on 17 January 1974. By the Seashore is a painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir completed in 1883 and is now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\n\n\n== History ==\nRenoir made a trip to Italy in 1881-82 and was deeply influenced by Renaissance art. After this trip he began to explore a new manner of painting, different from impressionism. He started to emphasize contours and modeling, abandoned the principle that scenes should be painted outdoors to capture light and atmosphere.\nLate in the summer of 1883, Renoir spent about a month in St. Peter Port, the capital of Guernsey, and admired the rocks, cliffs and stunning view of Moulin Huet Bay in St. Martin. He painted the starts of fifteen pictures during his stay, most of which were finished later in his Paris studio. Guernsey lies 48 km off the coast of mainland Normandy. Both share the same geology and Guernsey fulfills the \"by the sea\" criterion in the exhibition title.\nHowever, By the Seashore is thought to have been painted in the artist's studio. The beach depicted here is probably not in the Channel Islands but near Dieppe, on the Normandy coast. The model was Aline Charigot, his then girlfriend, whom he married in 1890. The arc of the sitter's dark eyebrows and saucily tilted nose in that pleasant, rosy-cheeked face are common to works by Renoir.\nBy the Seashore proto-typically reflects this period in Renoir's art. He worked with small compositions in the field that he then pulled together in more elaborate, larger works while in his studio. He was also playing with the disparity of space and scale between figure and background at this time. \n\n\n== Provenance ==\nThe painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan since 1929 from the bequest of Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of paintings by Pierre-Auguste Renoir\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (information table beside the painting)\n\n Media related to By the Seashore (1883) by Pierre-Auguste Renoir in the Metropolitan Museum of Art at Wikimedia Commons Erkko Kivikoski (2 July 1936 – 11 August 2005) was a Finnish film director and screenwriter.

Scriabin's Piano Sonata No. 2 in G-sharp minor, (Op. 19, also titled Sonata-Fantasy) took five years for him to write. It was finally published in 1898, at the urging of his publisher.  The piece is in two movements, with a style combining Chopin-like Romanticism with an impressionistic touch. The piece is widely appreciated and is one of Scriabin's most popular pieces.\nThe first movement Andante, in sonata form, begins with echoing effects, followed by two lyrically themed sections. The first theme is in G-Sharp minor, but the following two come in B major (the relative major). After a short climax in the development, the piece modulates to E major (also C-sharp minor) for the recapitulation and lyrical sections are restated with a slightly more complicated accompaniment. The second movement Presto, in sharp contrast to the first movement, is very fast and intense. Alternating crescendos and decrescendos may give the listener the impression of waves.\nThe precedent of Beethoven's \"Moonlight\" Sonata allowed Scriabin the luxury of an opening slow movement to his Second Sonata, whose programme reads thus: \n\"The first section represents the quiet of a southern night on the seashore; the development is the dark agitation of the deep, deep sea. The E major middle section shows caressing moonlight coming up after the first darkness of night. The second movement represents the vast expanse of ocean in stormy agitation.\"\nTypical of Scriabin's piano sonatas, it is technically and musically demanding for the pianist. A typical performance lasts about 11 minutes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSonata No. 2 (Scriabin): Scores at the International Music Score Library Project\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nScriabin's Piano Sonata No. 2 in G-sharp minor, Op. 19 played by Maria Perrotta Ben Palmer is a British film and television director who is known for being the director of\" Bo' Selecta\" and\" The Inbetweeners\".

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 10, 2000. Admiral Sir Edward Belcher  (27 February 1799 – 18 March 1877) was a British naval officer, hydrographer, and explorer. Born in Nova Scotia, he was the great-grandson of Jonathan Belcher, who served as a colonial governor of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Jersey.     Biography     Early life  Belcher was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the second son of Andrew Belcher and entered the Royal Navy in 1812.    Surveys  In 1825, he accompanied Frederick William Beechey's expedition to the Pacific and Bering Strait as a surveyor.: 153  In 1835 he was surveying in the Irish Sea in HMS Lightning: 221 , and in 1836 he commanded a surveying ship on the north and west coasts of Africa and in the British seas. Belcher took up the work which Beechey had left unfinished on the Pacific coast of South America. He was on board HMS Sulphur, which was ordered to return to England in 1839 via the Trans-Pacific route. Belcher made various observations at a number of islands which he visited, having been delayed by being despatched to take part in the war in China in 1840. On 25 January 1841, Commander Belcher landed on Possession Point at the north shore Hong Kong Island, and made the first British survey of Hong Kong harbour. After the war's end in 1842 he reached home and for his services was made a Knight Bachelor in the following year. He was then engaged on HMS Samarang, in surveying work in the East Indies, the Philippines, Port Hamilton, and other places, until 1847.    Arctic expedition  In 1852 Belcher led the last and largest Admiralty expedition to attempt to find and rescue Sir John Franklin. He was also to look for his former surveying officer in Hong Kong, Sir Richard Collinson, and Sir Robert McClure, whose ships had not been seen after entering the Bering Strait. He did a great deal of sledge exploration, rescued McClure and abandoned four of his five ships in the ice. He had five ships: HMS Assistance (Belcher), HMS Resolute (Henry Kellett, second mate George Nares), the steam tenders Pioneer (Sherard Osborn) and Intrepid (Sir Leopold McClintock) and the depot ship HMS North Star (William Pullen). Belcher and one tender were to enter the Wellington Channel, between Cornwallis Island and Devon Island, where Franklin was thought to be, while Kellett was to go west to Melville Island and look for Collinson and McClure. North Star was to stay at Beechey Island as a supply base. He left the Nore in April 1852. By early winter Assistance and Pioneer were frozen in at Northumberland Sound to the north of Wellington Channel while Resolute and Intrepid were frozen in off Melville Island – the first ships this far West since Sir William Edward Parry in 1819. A great deal of exploration was done by manhauled sledges. In April 1853 Leopold McClintock and others left Resolute on sledges and returned 105 days later, having covered 1,400 miles (2,300 km) and discovered Prince Patrick Island. Another party went West and discovered Robert McClure, whose ship was frozen in at Mercy Bay. Belcher went north by sledge and found a channel at the northern tip of Devon Island, hinting that Franklin might have used it to escape to Baffin Bay. When the ice broke up that summer, he pushed his ships up Wellington Channel and became trapped again. By February 1854, Belcher was becoming increasingly worried about the safety of his ships and men. In April he ordered Kellett to abandon his ships and return by sledge to North Star. Belcher abandoned his two ships in late July. Aided by two ships that showed up at Beechey Island (Phoenix and Breadalbane), the whole party returned to England. Belcher went through a court martial, which was automatic for any captain who had lost a ship.  He was exonerated, but his sword was returned to him \"without observation\". He never again received an active command. Curiously Resolute broke free of the ice and drifted all the way to Davis Strait, southwest of Greenland, where it was picked up by an American whaler. The American government graciously returned the ship to the United Kingdom, and when many years later the ship was broken up, its timbers were used to make a desk for the American president by way of a thank you. Ekins Island is an uninhabited island within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the territory of Nunavut. It lies in Norwegian Bay, north of Devon Island, and is also south of Cornwall Island, separated by Belcher Channel. Table Island is located about to the northeast. Saleyards Creek( also known as Saleyard Creek) is a canalised urban stream, acting as a stormwater channel, located in Sydney, Australia.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: What is the date of death of the director of film Escape To France?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nEscape to the Chateau is a Channel 4 reality television series, which follows the story of couple Dick Strawbridge and Angela (\"Angel\") Adoree and their family as they bought and renovated the 19th-century Château de la Motte-Husson, in Martigné-sur-Mayenne, France, while simultaneously raising two young children and starting a business hosting weddings and other events. The first season followed Dick and Angel's quest to restore the derelict château from its uninhabitable state by installing running water, heating and electricity in the 45-room château, which had not been lived in for the previous forty years. They were working against a deadline – their own wedding – which was to be held at the property. The subsequent seasons of the program continued the story as they established their special events business, at the same time as renovating the château and its grounds. It also documented family events and milestones. Nine series of the programme were filmed, with Series 9 first airing on Channel 4 in the UK on 30 October 2022. That was said to be the final series, a decision made with the agreement of the couple. Following the completion of the final series of Escape to the Chateau, Dick and Angel Strawbridge launched a weekly podcast titled Dick & Angel’s CHAT…EAU. The first episode launched on Global Player and other major podcast platforms on 1 November 2023, and is titled 112 Steps, 2 Turrets & 1 Tip. It involved the couple looking back at how they found their chateau and knew that it was \"the one\".

In Escape to the Chateau, his engineering and cooking experience is highlighted, with his can-do attitude and mechanical expertise at the fore, as work on the château and its surrounding land continues through the seasons.    Angela (\"Angel\") Adoree  Adoree was born 7 April 1978 as Angela Newman and grew up on Canvey Island, where her family ran a jewellers' shop. She runs a hospitality business called The Vintage Patisserie, for which she sought investment when she appeared on the reality television business programme, Dragon's Den, in 2010. In 2015, the business relocated to Chateau-de-la-Motte Husson. Adoree provided a creative factor and flair for the show, adding her style and interior-decoration skill to the château renovation, as well as sharing her interest in hospitality and entertaining. The couple has two children, Arthur and Dorothy.

Retrospective series  An additional three episode retrospective series began showing in late 2019. Piccolo mondo antico (literally: Little Ancient World), known in English as Old-Fashioned World , is a 1941 Italian drama film directed by Mario Soldati and based on the 1895 novel by Antonio Fogazzaro. It belongs to the movies of the calligrafismo style. \n\n\n== Production and reception ==\nIn the midst of the Mussolini dictatorship and the outbreak of World War II, Soldati, Mario Bonfantini, and Alberto Lattuada wrote the script while staying in a villa on Lake Como. The cast and crew were watched by police while filming on site at Lake Lugano, for fear they would attempt to escape to Switzerland. Some actors in the film speak in a Lombardi accent, a potentially subversive inclusion given the cultural repressions of the fascist Italian state. \nDespite the possible interpretations of the Austrian villain being an allusion to Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, the film was successful and would go on to be one of Soldati's best known films. Giuseppe De Santis, then a young critic, said of the film: \"For the first time our cinema offers a landscape that is not rarefied or tackily pictorial, but actually responds to the characters’ humanity, both as an emotional element and as an indicator of their sentiments.” The film launched the career of lead actress Alida Valli.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nDuring the Italian Risorgimento (mid-nineteenth century), in Austrian-occupied Lombardy, Franco Maironi (Massimo Serato), a young man from an aristocratic family, decides to marry Luisa (Alida Valli), a humble clerk's daughter, against his grandmother, the Marquess Orsola Maironi's wishes. The old lady makes the life of the newly married couple miserable (she destroys the will which would grant Franco his wealth, and causes Luisa's uncle to lose his job, as he was helping them). In the meantime, Luisa gives birth to little Maria. Franco is forced to go to Turin in search of a job. During his absence, Luisa's daughter drowns in Lake of Lugano and she is almost driven mad. Franco returns home for a short time but Luisa reacts coldly towards him. During the Second Italian War of Independence Franco becomes a volunteer soldier in the fight against Austrian and again meets his wife by Lake Maggiore. Despite Luisa's coldness, Franco is sure she still loves him. Aware that he might die in the war, he makes love to her one last time, leaving her pregnant.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe house of the author Fogazzaro in which some parts of the adaptation were filmed was donated and is now open as a museum.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPiccolo mondo antico at IMDb\n\n\n== References == Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV. Albert Thompson( born 1912, date of death unknown) was a Welsh footballer. Thomas Scott( 1907- date of death unknown) was an English diver. The following is a list of historically infamous prison escapes, and of people who escaped multiple times:    Famous historical escapes  There have been many infamous escapes throughout history:    13th century  In 1244, whilst imprisoned in the Tower of London, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr crafted a makeshift rope made of bed sheets and cloths, lowered it, and climbed down. However, because he was heavy, the rope broke and he fell to his death.    17th century  In 1621 Dutch author Hugo de Groot escaped from Loevestein Castle, where he was held captive, by hiding himself inside a book chest. He was then smuggled outside.    18th century  Englishman Jack Sheppard took to theft and burglary in 1723, and was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but escaped four times, making him a notorious public figure and wildly popular with the poorer classes. The Italian author and adventurer Giacomo Casanova escaped from prison in 1757. In 1781, Samuel Smedley was imprisoned in Old Mill Prison in Portsmouth, England. Smedley eventually escaped. Eugène-François Vidocq a French criminal turned criminalist, and considered to be the father of modern criminology and of the French national police force, escaped multiple times  in 1795 - 1796 over the course of a few weeks at the age of 20 while in captivity with the help of Francine, but was always captured soon again. He is also regarded as the first private detective. The former criminal became the founder and first director of France's first criminal investigative agency, the Sûreté Nationale, as well as the head of the first known private detective agency.    19th century   On 27 November 1863, John Hunt Morgan and six of his officers, most notably Thomas Hines, escaped from their cells in the Ohio Penitentiary by digging a tunnel from Hines' cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron. In the Libby Prison escape, during the American Civil War, over 109 Union POWs broke out of a building at Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia on the night between 9 February – 10 February 1864. Fifty-nine of the 109 prisoners successfully made it back to the Union lines; two were drowned in the nearby James River, and forty-eight were recaptured. Anarchist activist Peter Kropotkin managed to escape from a low-security prison in St. Petersburg. He hid himself in one of the finest restaurants there and later moved to England. The notorious outlaw Billy the Kid managed to escape from prison in 1881, but was captured and shot by Pat Garrett only a few months later. Italian brigand Giuseppe Musolino escaped from prison in 1899, subsequently going on a killing spree targeted against those who testified against him at his first trial. He was recaptured in 1901.    1900–1949  In 1901, Lum You was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by a Pacific County, Washington court.  He enjoyed great public sympathy, including from county officials, who supposedly allowed him to escape by leaving his cell door unlocked at night. He eventually seized the opportunity, but within a few days he either gave himself up or was recaptured. German Naval Air Service Kapitänleutnant Gunther Plüschow escaped from the Donington Hall prisoner of war camp in 1915. Frederick Mors, an Austrian-born American serial killer, was declared insane and placed into the Matteawan Institution for the Insane in the United States in 1915. He escaped in 1916 and was never seen again but supposedly resurfaced in Connecticut in 1917. His body was possibly found in 1923 and identified as a suicide. In 1921, at age 22 Victor Folke Nelson made a sensational and highly publicized run and escape from a line of 13 prisoners after attending chapel at the Charlestown State Prison. Despite an attempted intervening tackle from a prisoner trusty and bullets from a guard's gun, Nelson ran some distance, leapt, caught the lower end of the window bars, and scaled the 40-foot high wall of the prison's Cherry Hill section. At the top of the wall, he performed \"what was always believed an impossible stunt: throwing his body across a 10-foot space to the wall,\" where he managed to catch hold of the coping of a nearby structure and then to drop 30 feet down to the Boston and Maine railroad tracks.  He was convinced to volitionally return to prison by his respected mentor and progressive penologist Thomas Mott Osborne several months later. In 1922, an IRA bomb blew a hole in the wall of the Jail in Dundalk, County Louth, Ireland. William Thomas Smith( born 9 April 1897, date of death unknown) was an English professional footballer. Escape to Victory (or simply Victory) is a 1981 sports war film directed by John Huston and starring Sylvester Stallone, Michael Caine, Max von Sydow and Pelé. The film is about Allied prisoners of war who are interned in a German prison camp during the Second World War who play an exhibition match of football against a German team. The film received great attention upon its theatrical release, as it starred professional footballers Bobby Moore, Osvaldo Ardiles, Kazimierz Deyna, Paul Van Himst, Mike Summerbee, Hallvar Thoresen, Werner Roth and Pelé. Numerous Ipswich Town players were also in the film, including John Wark, Russell Osman, Laurie Sivell, Robin Turner and Kevin O'Callaghan. Other Ipswich Town players stood in for actors in the football scenes – Kevin Beattie for Michael Caine, and Paul Cooper for Sylvester Stallone. Yabo Yablonsky wrote the script and the film was entered into the 12th Moscow International Film Festival.    Plot  A team of Allied prisoners of war (POWs), coached and led by English Captain John Colby, a professional footballer for West Ham United before the war, agree to play an exhibition match against a German team, only to find themselves involved in a German propaganda stunt. Colby is the captain and essentially the manager of the team and thus chooses his squad of players. Another POW, Robert Hatch, an American who is serving with the Canadian Army, is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team as the team's trainer, as Hatch needs to be with the team to facilitate his upcoming escape attempt. Colby's superior officers repeatedly try to convince him to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt, but Colby consistently refuses, fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning his unrelated escape attempt, and Colby's superiors agree to help him if he in return agrees to journey to Paris, contact the French Resistance and try to convince them to help the football team escape. Hatch succeeds in escaping the prison camp and finding the Resistance in Paris. The Resistance initially believes it will be too risky to aid the team's escape, but once they realise the game will be at the Colombes Stadium, they plan the escape using a tunnel from the Parisian sewer system to the showers in the players' changing room. They convince Hatch to let himself be recaptured so that he can pass this information back to the leading British officers at the prison camp. Hatch is indeed recaptured. However, he is placed in solitary confinement, and thus the prisoners do not know if the French underground will help them. Colby tells the Germans that he needs Hatch on the team because Hatch is the backup goalkeeper and the starting goalkeeper has broken his arm. Colby himself actually has to break the starting goalkeeper's arm because the Germans want proof of the injury before they will allow Hatch to join the Allied lineup. In the end, the POWs can leave the German camp only to play the match; they are to be imprisoned again afterward. The resistance's tunnelers break through to the Allied dressing room at halftime with the POWs trailing, 4–1. However, the team  persuades Hatch to return to the pitch for the second half rather than lead the escape as planned. Despite the match officials being heavily biased towards the Germans, and the German team causing several deliberate injuries to the Allied players, a 4–4 draw is achieved after great performances from Luis Fernandez, Carlos Rey  and Terry Brady. Hatch plays goalkeeper and makes excellent saves, including a save of a penalty kick as time expires to deny the Germans the win. An Allied goal had been blatantly disallowed earlier in the match, so the POWs should have won, 5–4. After Hatch preserves the draw, the crowd storms the field and swarms the players. Some of the spectators help the Allied players disguise themselves in the chaos so that they can escape, and they all burst through the gates to freedom.    Cast     Production     Development and writing  Filmed in Hungary, the film is based on the 1962 Hungarian film drama Két félidő a pokolban (\"Two half-times in Hell\"), which was directed by Zoltán Fábri and won the critics' award at the 1962 Boston Cinema Festival. The film was inspired by the now discredited story of the so-called Death Match in which FC Dynamo Kyiv defeated German soldiers while Ukraine was occupied by German troops in World War II. According to myth, as a result of their victory, the Ukrainians were all shot. The true story is considerably more complex, as the team played a series of matches against German teams, emerging victorious in all of them, before any of them were sent to prison camps by the Gestapo. There have been multiple prison escapes where an inmate escapes by means of a helicopter.  One of the earliest instances was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed \"Man Fan\", on August 19, 1971, from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico. Kaplan was a New York businessman who not only escaped the prison but eventually got out of Mexico and went on to write a book about his experience, The 10-Second Jailbreak.\nFrance has had more recorded helicopter prison escape attempts than any other country, with at least 11. One of the most notable French jail breaks occurred in 1986, when the wife of bank robber Michel Vaujour studied for months to learn how to fly a helicopter. Using her newly acquired skills, she rented a white helicopter and flew low over Paris to take her husband from the roof of his fortress prison. Vaujour was later seriously wounded in a shootout with police where he was shot in the head and his wife was arrested.\nThe record for most helicopter escapes goes to convicted murderer Pascal Payet, who has used helicopters to escape from prisons in 2001, 2003, and most recently 2007.\nAnother multiple helicopter escapee is Vassilis Palaiokostas, who on February 22, 2009, escaped for the second time from the same prison.\nTo thwart attempts of this nature, many prisons have taken precautions such as nets or cables strung over open prison courtyards.\nThis list includes prisoner escapes where a helicopter was used in an attempt to free prisoners from a place of internment, a prison or correctional facility.\n\n\n== Actual attempts ==\n\n\n== Escapes in fiction ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of prison escapes\nList of people who escaped multiple times from prison\nList of prisoner-of-war escapes\nEscape tunnel\nRescue\nPrison escape\n\n\n== References == Soldati is an Italian surname.

He then studied humanities at the University of Turin. At that time, the University was a hotbed of intellectual activity and the young Soldati met and befriended the likes of activist and writer Carlo Levi and journalist Giacomo Debenedetti, who were his seniors. He later studied History of Art at the University of Rome. He started publishing novels in 1929. He achieved the widest notice with America primo amore, published in 1935, a memoir of the time he spent teaching at Columbia University. He won literary awards for his work, most notably the Strega Prize for Lettere da Capri in 1954.\nAlso interested in film, Soldati began directing in 1938. His most well-known films are Piccolo mondo antico (1941) and Malombra (1942) with Isa Miranda, both based on novels by Antonio Fogazzaro. These two films belong to the early 1940s movement in Italian cinema known as calligrafismo. Other popular films were Eugenie Grandet, based on Balzac's novel, with Alida Valli; Fuga in Francia (1948); The River Girl (starring Sophia Loren), and La provinciale (starring Gina Lollobrigida). Soldati also regularly published articles in Italian newspapers, including Il Mondo, Il Corriere della Sera, La Stampa, Avanti, L'Unità and Il Giorno.\nSoldati died at Lerici in 1999.

Waterloo (Russian: Ватерлоо) is a 1970 English-language epic historical war film about the Battle of Waterloo. A co-production between Italy and the Soviet Union, it was directed by Sergei Bondarchuk and produced by Dino De Laurentiis. It stars Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte and Christopher Plummer as the Duke of Wellington with a cameo by Orson Welles as Louis XVIII of France. Other stars include Jack Hawkins as General Sir Thomas Picton, Virginia McKenna as the Duchess of Richmond and Dan O'Herlihy as Marshal Ney. Steiger and Plummer often narrate sections in voice-over, presenting thoughts of Napoleon and Wellington. The film takes a largely neutral stance and portrays many individual leaders and soldiers on each side, rather than simply focusing on Wellington and Napoleon. It creates a generally accurate chronology of the events of the battle, the extreme heroism on each side, and the loss of life suffered by all the armies which took part. The film is most famous for its lavish battle scenes, shot on-location in Uzhhorod, Ukraine. Its 15,000 authentically dressed extras, recreating  battle scenes with true numbers and without special effects, remain the largest body of costumed extras in any film. Despite mixed critical reviews, it won several awards, including BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction, and the 1971 David di Donatello for Best Film.    Plot  In the aftermath of the 1814 campaign, French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte is forced to abdicate at the demands of his marshals. Exiled to Elba with 1,000 men, Napoleon escapes after a year and once more rallies the French to his side. King Louis XVIII flees, and the European powers declare war once again. In Brussels during the Duchess of Richmond's ball, the Duke of Wellington is warned of Napoleon's march into Belgium, tactically driving a wedge between the British and Prussian armies. Wellington, in consulting with his staff, elects to halt Napoleon at Waterloo. At Quatre-Bras, Marshal Ney fights the British to a draw, whereas Napoleon defeats the Prussians at Ligny. Ney rides to Napoleon to deliver his report, but in doing so has allowed Wellington to withdraw his still intact forces. Napoleon commands Grouchy to lead 30,000 men against the Prussians to prevent their rejoining the British, whilst Napoleon will command his remaining troops against Wellington. On June 18, 1815, the Battle of Waterloo commences with initial cannon fire from the French. Napoleon launches teasing attacks against Wellington's flanks at Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte, though Wellington refuses to divert his main force. General Picton is sent to plug a gap when a Dutch brigade is routed, and though successful he is killed in doing so. Ponsonby also leads a cavalry charge against the French cannon, but becomes isolated from the main allied force and is cut down by French lancers. Troops spotted emerging from the east are worryingly assumed to be Grouchy by Wellington, and Blücher to Napoleon. Suffering from stomach pain, Napoleon momentarily withdraws and leaves Ney in command. Simultaneously, the order is given to allied troops to retire 100 paces, which Ney incorrectly interprets as a withdrawal. Ney leads a cavalry charge against the British, but is repelled with casualties by infantry squares. Despite this, the battle still wages much in Napoleon's favor; La Haye Sainte falls to the French, and Napoleon ultimately decides to send the Imperial Guard to deliver the decisive blow. During their advance, Maitland's 1st Foot Guards who were lying in tall grass deliver a devastating point blank volley against the Imperial Guard, repulsing them with heavy casualties. At the same time, Blücher arrives in the field. For the first time in its history the Imperial Guard breaks, and the battle is won by the Allied forces. That evening after the battle, Wellington is seen observing the thousands of casualties on the field. Napoleon, having survived the battle, is urged to flee at the pleas of his marshals.

It wasn't until De Laurentiis began talks with the Soviets in the late 1960s, that he found the financing he was looking for. He reached an agreement with Mosfilm, in which final costs were more than £12 million (GBP) (equivalent to about U.S. Capriccio, also released with the international titles Love & Passion and Capri Remembered, is an Italian erotic drama film directed by Tinto Brass.

        "answer": "February 24, 1880",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When is the director of film The Voice In The Fog 's birthday?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nMcGowan  is an Irish and Scottish surname. It is an Anglicization of the Irish Mac Gabhann and Scottish Mac Gobhann, both of which mean 'son of (the) smith'. Belonging to the Uí Echach Cobo, located in modern-day western County Down, Ulster, they were of the same stock as the McGuinness clan.    Meaning  As noted further in the source by John O'Hart, though not an occupational surname, MacGowan evolves as an Anglicisation of the original Gaelic language personal description or nickname gobha, meaning \"blacksmith\". For this reason, the surnames of some septs of the MacGowan are alternately anglicised to Smythe or Smith. The surname MacGowan, therefore, translates from Gaelic language to English language as \"son of (the) smith\".    Scottish origins  In Scotland, Mac an Ghobhain was anglicized to MacGowan. Mac Gobha, later McGow, was also made MacGowan. As the maker of arms and armour, the smith was an important hereditary position in each clan and there were MacGowans, or MacGouns, found throughout the Highlands. The two most important septs, however, were the MacGowans of Clan Donald (only to be found in Antrim and South Uist) and those of Clan MacPherson. There was also an Irish-Scot Clan MacGowan recorded in fourteenth-century Nithsdale in Dumfriesshire. The Irish origins of this clan suggest that the Scottish Clan MacGowan may descend from the same eponymous ancestor as those in Ireland who bear the name, with the Scottish branch of the clan having fled to Scotland during the Norman occupation of Ireland. Separately, in Stirlingshire there was an old family of MacGowans of uncertain origin.    Irish origins   In Ireland the name MacGowan refers to an eponymous ancestor, Aengus an Gobhain (\"Angus the Smith\") or Áengus Goibnenn mac Fergus Gallen mheic Tibraide Tirech, who was a High King of Ulster and the son of Fergus Galeng, son of Tipraiti Tireach.  The MacGowans were formerly chiefs in Dalariada, a principality in eastern Ulidia. However, they were driven to Donegal, Cavan, and Sligo in the 12th century due to English invasions in eastern Ireland. The MacGowans who settled in Sligo had their home at Castlegowan in Sligo, and thereafter a great number of them moved to Rossinver Parish in Leitrim. The name McGowan is now very popular in County Sligo and County Leitrim. The name McGowan is particularly common in the parish of Manorhamilton in Leitrim. This family gave birth to many eminent ecclesiastics and literary men, and among the latter class may be mentioned Tadg Mac-an-Gowan, chief historiographer to the O'Connors towards the close of the 14th century; Felan M'an- Gowan by whom, assisted by the O'Dugans of East Galway, was compiled the Book of the O'Kellys, commonly called the Book of Hy-Many; and the no less distinguished ecclesiastical writer, Angus Ceile De M'anGowan, author of Lives of the Irish Saints and other tracts, who lived in the third quarter of the 8th century, and of whom the following pedigree is preserved. As for the MacGowans who remained in the northeast of Ireland (in Antrim specifically), this family would later be associated with the MacDonnell Chieftains, who were a branch of the Scottish Clan Donald.    Notable people   Alistair McGowan (born 1964), British impressionist Andrew McGowan (born 1961), Australian priest and scholar Angela McGowan, Australian archeologist Archibald C. McGowan (1822–1893), New York politician Baron McGowan, the title of four Scottish barons Bill McGowan (1896–1954), American baseball umpire Brandon McGowan (born 1983), American football player Brian McGowan (disambiguation) several people including: Brian McGowan (businessman) (born 1945), co-founder of Williams Holdings Brian McGowan (footballer) (born 1938), Australian rules footballer Brian McGowan (politician) (1935–1994), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Charles M. McGowan (1923–2013), American businessman and politician Donald W. McGowan (1899–1967), U.S. P. J. McGowan (born 1951/52) is an Irish Gaelic football manager and administrator. He succeeded Brian McEniff as Donegal manager in 1994 and lasted until 1997, thus preceding Declan Bonner's first spell in charge. He also managed Fermanagh.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMcGowan is from Ballybofey. His club is Seán Mac Cumhaills. He first became involved in football when he was ten years of age.\nMcGowan managed Donegal to the 1987 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship. In the early 1990s, he spent a short time as senior manager of Fermanagh.\nMcGowan took over as Donegal's senior manager in the wake of Donegal's success in the 1992 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, at a time when players such as Anthony Molloy and Martin McHugh had retired. He managed Donegal to the finals of the 1994–95 and 1995–96 National Football Leagues. In between he managed Donegal to an Ulster Senior Football Championship victory over reigning All-Ireland champions Down in 1995, a game which took place one week after the first league final loss. They then lost to Monaghan in a game he described as the lowest point of his time as manager.\nHis last championship game in charge was a heavy defeat to Cavan, managed by McHugh. McGowan announced his departure as Donegal manager in 1997, The Irish Times reporting: \"His statement was equivocal — saying that he would not oppose anyone who wanted to take over the position - but he admits it amounts to a resignation\", though McGowan told the newspaper: \"I'd have taken it on if no-one else was willing… I don't have a divine right to this job\". Among the players he introduced during his time as manager were Damian Diver, Peter McGinley, James Ruane and Brian Roper.\nMcGowan was later part of the backroom team of Brian McEniff when he returned as manager.\nMcGowan has been an administrator on the Ulster Council. As vice-chairman of the county board, he was part of the selection committee tasked with choosing a new senior football manager in 2008. He completed five years as Donegal County Chairman in December 2012.\nHe managed Aodh Ruadh in 2006.\n\n\n== References == Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.

A foghorn or fog signal is a device that uses sound to warn vehicles of navigational hazards such as rocky coastlines, or boats of the presence of other vessels, in foggy conditions. The term is most often used in relation to marine transport. When visual navigation aids such as lighthouses are obscured, foghorns provide an audible warning of rock outcrops, shoals, headlands, or other dangers to shipping.    Description  All foghorns use a vibrating column of air to create an audible tone, but the method of setting up this vibration differs. Some horns, such as the Daboll trumpet, used vibrating plates or metal reeds, a similar principle to a modern electric car horn. Others used air forced through holes in a rotating cylinder or disk, in the same manner as a siren. Semi-automatic operation of foghorns was achieved by using a clockwork mechanism (or \"coder\") to sequentially open the valves admitting air to the horns; each horn was given its own timing characteristics to help mariners identify them.    History     Early fog signals   Audible fog signals have been used in one form or another for hundreds of years, initially simply seashell horns, fog bells or gongs struck manually. At some lighthouses, a small cannon was let off periodically to warn away ships, but this was labor-intensive and dangerous. In the United States, whistles were also used where a source of steam power was available, though Trinity House, the British lighthouse authority, did not employ them, preferring an explosive signal. Throughout the 19th century efforts were made to automate the signalling process. Trinity House eventually developed a system (the \"Signal, Fog, Mk I\") for firing a gun-cotton charge electrically.  However, the charge had to be manually replaced after each signal. At Portland Bill, for example, which had a five-minute interval between fog-signals, this meant the horns had to be lowered, the two new charges inserted, and the horns raised again every five minutes during foggy periods. Clockwork systems were also developed for striking bells. Stricken bells were developed throughout the 1800s with the use of a governor, including the use of a giant triangle of 4 ft long sides in Maine in 1837. Ships were required to carry bells, with an exemption for Turkish ships because Islam forbade the use of bells. Captain James William Newton claimed to have been the inventor of the fog signalling technique using loud and low notes.    Mechanization   The first automated steam-powered foghorn was invented by Robert Foulis, a Scotsman who emigrated to Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. Foulis is said to have heard his daughter playing the piano in the distance on a foggy night, and noticed the low notes were more audible than the higher notes: he then designed a device to produce a low-frequency sound, as well as a code system for use with it. Foulis repeatedly presented his concept to the Commissioners of Light Houses for the Bay of Fundy for installation on Partridge Island. While the Commissioners initially rejected Foulis's plan, one commissioner eventually encouraged Foulis to submit detailed plans to the Commission.  For reasons unknown, the plans were given to another Canadian engineer, T. T. Vernon Smith, who officially submitted them to the Commissioners as his own. The foghorn was constructed at Partridge Island in 1859 as the Vernon-Smith horn.  After protest by Foulis and a legislative inquiry, Foulis was credited as the true inventor, but he never patented or profited from his invention. The development of fog signal technology continued apace at the end of the 19th century.  During the same period an inventor, Celadon Leeds Daboll, developed a coal-powered foghorn called the Daboll trumpet for the American lighthouse service, though it was not universally adopted. A few Daboll trumpets remained in use until the mid-20th century. In the United Kingdom, experiments to develop more effective foghorns were carried out by John Tyndall and Lord Rayleigh, amongst others. The latter's ongoing research for Trinity House culminated in a design for a siren with a large trumpet designed to achieve maximum sound propagation (see reference for details of the Trials of Fog Signals), installed in Trevose Head Lighthouse, Cornwall in 1913.

In the same vein as BRB's Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds, the characters are anthropomorphisms of various animals as the species depicted are of much greater variety than in that series. The core trio are all felines being pursued by three canine foes. Willy Fog (Phileas Fogg in the original book) is depicted as a lion, while Rigodon (Passepartout) is a cat, and Romy (Aouda) is a panther. An English dub of the series was directed by Tom Wyner, which featured artists such as Cam Clarke (as Rigodon), Gregory Snegoff (Inspector Dix), Steve Kramer (as Constable Bully) and Mike Reynolds. While the series never achieved popularity in the United States, the English version found fame when it was broadcast on Children's BBC in the United Kingdom. The series was initially screened in 1984 in the UK (and has been repeated many times since) and then on RTÉ in Ireland, while other dubs gained the series fanbases in several other countries. The series was also dubbed into Japanese and aired on Japan's TV Asahi in 1987, where it was titled Anime Around the World in 80 Days (アニメ80日間世界一周, Anime Hachijūnichikan Sekai Isshū). With all of the international versions, the height of popularity remains in Spain, where a sequel series, Willy Fog 2, was produced in 1993 which has the characters in adaptations of Verne's science fiction novels, Journey to the Center of the Earth and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas. Furthermore, in 2008, the series spawned a live-action theatrical musical show in celebration of its 25th anniversary.    Plot  As with every morning since he moved into Savile Row, Willy Fog awakens at 8:00 am and rings for his servant, only to remember that he fired him the previous day for his inability to follow Fog's precise schedule. He has already arranged an interview for a replacement – former circus performer Rigodon, who is even now rushing towards Fog's house to make his 11:00 am appointment. Rigodon is accompanied by his old circus colleague Tico, who hides within his travelling bag, and prompts him through the interview, which gets off to a bad start when Rigodon arrives four minutes late. Nonetheless, Rigodon is hired by Fog as his butler and soon departs for the Reform Club. At the club, the main topic of conversation is the recent theft of £55,000 from the Bank of England which was discussed until the bank's governor Mr. Sullivan arrives and requests a change of topic. Sullivan's off-hand remark that the thief is still in London causes the elderly Lord Guinness to bring up an article in the Morning Chronicle, detailing how it is now possible to travel around the world in eighty days. The article states that one departs London by train for Dover, where one crosses to Calais, and on to Paris. From there, it is a train journey to Brindisi, and the Suez Canal, all within a week. Having rounded the Arabian peninsula, one would arrive in Bombay on day 20 and then a three-day railway journey to Calcutta. Hong Kong is reached on day 33, Yokohama on day 39, and then a mammoth three-week crossing of the Pacific to arrive in San Francisco on day 61, a week-long train crossing to New York City and then finally a nine-day crossing of the Atlantic back to London making it possible to circumnavigate the globe in eighty days. The other members of the club laugh at Lord Guinness's suggestion that he would take on the challenge if he were younger, prompting Fog to defend his honor by taking up the task himself. Sullivan bets Fog £5,000 that it is impossible, and additional wagers by three other club members increase this amount to £20,000. He then stuns the club by announcing that he will leave that very evening and promises to return to the club by 8:45 pm on 21 December 1872. Rigodon is less than thrilled to hear the news of their impending trip, having spent his life travelling with the circus. However, he dutifully accompanies his master as they set out, with Tico still in hiding. Little do they know, however, that they are pursued by three individuals determined to halt their progress.

The Russian script was written by Sergei Grigoryevich Kozlov, who also published a book under the same name. In 2006, Norstein published a book titled Hedgehog in the Fog, listing himself as an author alongside Kozlov.    Plot  The Hedgehog (voiced by Maria Vinogradova) goes to visit his friend the Bear Cub to drink tea with raspberry jam and count the stars. The road along which the Hedgehog moves passes through deserted fields and forest thickets. In the early evening fog, the world seems mysterious, and outlandish images appear before the Hedgehog every now and then. Among them is an eagle-owl looking into a well, a snail suddenly turning into an elephant, a bat with a frightening wingspan, and a dog returning the bundle of jam to the Hedgehog when he loses it. Hedgehog is particularly impressed by a white horse, whose blurred silhouette appears several times in the haze. Through the fog, the voice of the Bear Cub is periodically heard calling out to the Hedgehog. Hurrying to answer the call, the hero falls into the river. His savior is a mysterious “someone” who takes the Hedgehog to the shore. Having finally arrived at the Bear Cub’s house, Hedgehog listens to his friend (voiced by Vyacheslav Nevinny), who says that he has already blown up the samovar on the porch for evening tea, collected juniper branches “so that there is smoke”, and moved the wicker chairs to be more comfortable. He remarks that the Hedgehog is the only one he can really count the stars with.    Creators     Awards  1976—Frunze All-Union Film Festival: Hedgehog in the Fog \"best animated film\" 1976—Tehran Children's and Youth Film Festival: Hedgehog in the Fog \"best animated film\" 2003—Tokyo All time animation best 150 in Japan and Worldwide: Hedgehog in the Fog \"№1 Animated film of all the time\"    Production   The fog effects were created by putting a very thin piece of paper on top of the scene and slowly lifting it up toward the camera frame-by-frame until everything behind it became blurry and white.    Role in Soviet animation  Soviet-era children's animation and literature was faced with the task of producing politically acceptable content. Anthropologist Serguei Oushakine (Sergey Ushakin) recognizes this atmosphere of indefinite deferment in the animation, stating: \"The main thing is the work of imagination, or more precisely, the terror and pleasure with which it is linked. The final scene of pleasure, to which these various phantasmal and/or realistic experiences should indeed have led, is not included in the plot.\" This is evident through the hedgehog's anxiety and fixation on the horse, even after he succeeds in meeting the bear for tea.    Legacy  An English Dub of the film was made for Channel 4 in the United Kingdom for Christmas in 1998. John Paterson McGowan (February 24, 1880 – March 26, 1952) was a pioneering Hollywood actor and director and occasionally a screenwriter and producer. J. P. McGowan, as he was usually known, remains the only Australian to have been made a life member of the Screen Directors Guild (now Directors Guild of America). == Biography ==\n\nBorn in the then-bustling railway centre of Terowie in South Australia, McGowan grew up in Adelaide (Islington) and Sydney (Eveleigh, now Redfern, and Newtown). He was a capable horseman and served in the Second Boer War with Montmorency's Scouts as a special dispatch rider.\nFrom South Africa McGowan was recruited to take part in a Boer War exhibit in the US at the 1904 World's Fair. He then began working in live theatre, and in 1910 joined Kalem Studios in New York City. That year McGowan made his first film appearance in A Lad from Old Ireland as part of the crew that traveled to Ireland to do the first American film shot on location outside of the United States. His horseback riding ability enabled him to do many of Kalem's riding stunts.\nMcGowan directed and often acted in the first 33 episodes of Kalem's 1914 adventure film series, The Hazards of Helen, which eventually ran to 54 episodes, some still with McGowan's participation. With other contributors, the series ran on to 119 episodes in all. While filming he began a relationship with Helen Holmes, the film's star, and the two married. They left Kalem to set up their own production company, Signal Films, which successfully made mainly railroad melodrama serials and features but lost out when their distributor (Mutual) failed. The collaboration ended when they divorced in 1925. There was an adopted daughter, Kaye.\nMcGowan successfully made the transition from silent film to talkies. While never a major star, in a busy career that spanned four decades he is credited with acting in 232 films—mostly strong roles like sheriff or villain—writing 26 screenplays and directing 242 productions. In 1932 he directed a young John Wayne in the 12-episode rail vs airplane serial The Hurricane Express for the independent Mascot Pictures. McGowan had a strong role in the Gene Autry picture Guns and Guitars but only the sidekick actors were noted on the poster\nFrom 1938 to 1951, as Executive Secretary of the Screen Directors Guild, he fought to secure recognition for the director within the studio systems of the film and emerging television industry.\n\nMcGowan died in 1952 in Hollywood and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.\nMcGowan's career was celebrated in the town of his birth with the Terowie Days of Rail and Screen 2002–2010. The adventurous, stunt-filled partnership with Helen Holmes has been celebrated in the inventive bio-tribute, 'Stunt Love', which was presented at the Adelaide Film Festival in February 2011 and at Museum of Modern Art, New York, in April 2011.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\n\n\n=== Director ===\n\n\n=== Actor ===\nWhispering Smith (1908) - George McCloud\nFrom the Manger to the Cross (1912) - Wise Man 1\nThe Hazards of Helen (1914, Serial) - Train Controller / Benton / Rand - Yeggman / Dan Haddon - Cowboy / Brandt - Cashier / Blake - Lineman / Rand - Fireman / Lockwood - Flagman / Warren - Railman / Thomas - Wiretapper Chief / Trow - Wrecking Crewman\nCold Steel (1921)\nHills of Missing Men (1922)\nOne Million in Jewels (1923)\nThe Patent Leather Pug (1925)\nRed Blood (1925)\nFighting Luck (1925)\nBarriers of the Law (1925)\nRiding Romance (1925)\nMakers of Men (1925)\nMoran of the Mounted (1926)\nThe Royal American (1927)\nThe Devil's Tower (1928)\nThe Code of the Scarlet (1928)\nDugan of the Dugouts (1928)\nAn Oklahoma Cowboy (1929)\nSeñor Americano (1929)\nThe Cowboy and the Outlaw (1929)\nBad Men's Money (1929)\nWyoming Tornado (1929)\nThe Oklahoma Kid (1929)\nHeadin' Westward (1929)\nBreezy Bill (1930)\nWhen Lightning Strikes (1934)\nThe Outlaw Tamer (1935)\nFury and the Woman (1936) Brian Saunders( date of birth and death unknown) was a male weightlifter who competed for England.

The Fog is a 1980 American independent supernatural horror film directed by John Carpenter, who also co-wrote the screenplay and created the music for the film. It stars Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh and Hal Holbrook. It tells the story of a strange, glowing fog that sweeps over a small coastal town in Northern California. Filmed in the spring of 1979, The Fog was scheduled to be released at Christmas that year by AVCO Embassy Pictures, but its release date was delayed to February 1, 1980. The film divided critics upon release, receiving praise for its visuals and acting, and criticism for its structure and screenplay. Despite mixed reviews, the film grossed $21.3 million domestically. The Fog contains themes of revenge and repressed corrupt historical events resurfacing in contemporary small-town America. In the years since its original release, it has established a cult following. A remake was released in 2005.    Plot  On the eve of the centennial of the small coastal town Antonio Bay in Northern California, old Mr. Machen tells ghost stories to children by a campfire on the beach. One story is about a clipper ship that crashed against the rocks nearby, causing all of its crew to drown after mistaking a campfire for a lighthouse while sailing through an unearthly fog. Machen finishes the story as midnight strikes and paranormal activity begins occurring around the town. Town priest, Father Malone, discovers his grandfather's diary. The journal reveals that a century earlier, in 1880, the 6 founders of Antonio Bay (including Malone's grandfather) deliberately wrecked a clipper ship named the Elizabeth Dane, so that its wealthy, leprosy-afflicted owner Blake would not establish a leper colony nearby. The conspirators used the gold plundered from the ship to establish the town. Meanwhile, out at sea, a strange, glowing fog envelops a fishermen's trawler. The fog brings with it the Elizabeth Dane, carrying the vengeful ghosts of Blake and his crew, who kill the fishermen. The following morning, local radio DJ Stevie Wayne is given a piece of driftwood by her son Andy, who found it on the beach. It is inscribed with the word \"DANE\". Stevie takes it with her to the lighthouse where she broadcasts her radio show. As she is listening to music on a cassette, the driftwood begins seeping water. As the water touches her cassette player, a man's voice is inexplicably heard on the tape, swearing revenge, and the words \"6 must die\" appear on the wood before it bursts into flames. Stevie extinguishes the fire and sees that the wood once again reads \"DANE\", and the tape is once again playing normally. Town resident Nick and hitchhiker Elizabeth find the lost fishing trawler adrift and the corpse of one of the fishermen. Later, while Elizabeth is in the autopsy room alone, the fisherman's corpse briefly comes to life and accosts her before collapsing. Nick and coroner Dr. Phibes see the now-lifeless corpse has carved the number 3 on the floor with a scalpel. That evening, as the town begins its celebrations, local weatherman Dan is killed by the ghosts at the weather station. The fog has returned and starts moving inland, disrupting the town's telephone and power lines. Using a backup generator, Stevie begs her listeners to go to her house and save her son. The ghosts kill her son's babysitter but Nick and Elizabeth rescue Andy. Stevie advises her listeners to head to the town's church, but then finds herself trapped and under siege by the ghosts when the fog envelops her lighthouse. Seeking refuge inside the church, a group of townsfolk finds a large gold cross in the wall cavity, made from the rest of the stolen gold from the Elizabeth Dane, just as the fog begins enveloping the church and the ghosts begin their attack. Malone, knowing that the ghosts have returned to take 6 lives instead of the 6 original conspirators, offers the gold and himself to spare the others. The ghost of Blake himself seizes the gold cross and he and his crew disappear in a blinding flash of light as the fog miraculously vanishes. Stevie, now alone again at the lighthouse, warns her listeners that the fog could come again and instructs any ships that can hear her to keep an eye out for it. After everyone leaves the church, Malone remains inside and wonders why he was spared given that there were only 5 deaths. The fog then reappears along with the ghosts, and Blake decapitates Malone, making 6.    Cast     Themes and interpretations  The Fog's central themes are revenge and the resurfacing of \"repressed past events\" in small-town America, as it focuses on the supernatural vengeance inflicted on the residents of a community that has prospered from looted salvage. The Voice in the Fog is a lost 1916 silent film produced by Jesse Lasky and distributed by Paramount Pictures. J. P. McGowan directed the film which is based on a novel by Harold McGrath.

Rekha is an Indian actress who has had a prolific career in Hindi films, and is acknowledged as one of the finest actresses of Indian cinema. She first appeared as a child artist in two Telugu-language films Inti Guttu (1958) and Rangula Ratnam (1966), but her career as a lead started with the Kannada film Operation Jackpot Nalli C.I.D 999 in 1969. In that same year, she starred in her first Hindi film, Anjana Safar, which was delayed for ten years due to censorship problems. Her first Hindi release was Sawan Bhadon (1970), a commercial success which established her as a rising star. She followed with roles in Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972), Kahani Kismat Ki (1973), and Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1974), to mainstream success but little recognition for her acting, and press criticism of her looks and overweight. Rekha was motivated to improve her acting and appearance and managed a well-publicised transformation, both physically and in terms of her screen persona and command of the Hindi language. Her work in the 1976 drama Do Anjaane was better received, and critical recognition of her roles as a rape victim in Ghar and a courtesan in Muqaddar Ka Sikandar (1978) marked the beginning of the most successful period of her career. Through most of the 1980s and early 1990s, she was one of the leading actresses in Hindi cinema. Her comic role in Khubsoorat (1980) earned her a first Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Further mainstream success came with roles in a myriad of family and drama films such as Baseraa (1981), Silsila (1981), Ek Hi Bhool (1981), Jeevan Dhaara (1982), and Agar Tum Na Hote (1983). During this period, she extended her work into arthouse films, a movement of neo-realist films known in India as parallel cinema, often to favourable reviews. These films included Kalyug (1981), Umrao Jaan (1981), Vijeta (1982), Utsav (1984), and Ijaazat (1987). Her acclaimed portrayal of the eponymous classical courtesan in Umrao Jaan won her the National Film Award for Best Actress. Her work during the decade included sporadic dubbing and playback singing. Having credited her physical change to diet and yoga practice, she released an exercise audio, Rekha's Mind and Body Temple (1983). A period of decline during the middle of the decade was followed by Khoon Bhari Maang, among the first of a new trend of women-centred revenge films, which starred Rekha in the role of a woman avenging her attempted murder by her husband, and earned her a second Best Actress Filmfare Award. Her work was much less frequent in subsequent decades. Most of her films in early 1990s mostly met with lukewarm reviews and were rejected by the audience. She was cast in several parts similar to that in Khoon Bhari Maang, the great majority of which failed to leave a similar mark, except for considerable success with Phool Bane Angaray (1991). In 1996, she won a third Filmfare Award, in the Best Supporting Actress category, for her negative turn of an underworld don in the action thriller Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996), one of the year's highest-earning Hindi films. She accepted parts in two controversial films: a Kama Sutra instructor in Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love (1996) and a housewife moonlighting as a prostitute in Aastha: In the Prison of Spring (1997), to critical acclaim but some public scrutiny. In the 2000s, she was praised for her supporting roles in the 2001 dramas Zubeidaa and Lajja, and started playing mother roles, among which was her role in the science fiction Koi... Mil Gaya (2003) and its superhero sequel Krrish (2006). While her leading roles in the comedies Bachke Rehna Re Baba (2005) and Kudiyon Ka Hai Zamana (2006) were met with disapproval by critics, her supporting part in Yatra (2006) was better reviewed.

Kanhaiyalal (1910 – 14 August 1982) was an Indian actor who acted in 122 films in his career, primarily in Hindi films produced in Bollywood, the Mumbai-based film industry.    Early life  Kanhaiyalal was born in 1910 in Varanasi. His father Pandit Bhairodutt Choube, popularly known as Choubeji, was the proprietor of the Sanatan Dharm Natak Samaj in Varanasi. With his father not in agreement with him taking up any form of stage work, he eventually wore out his father's opposition and did odd jobs in the troupe. At 16, he started writing and then moved on to small roles. When his father died, the brothers tried to run the drama company for some time. Proving to be unsuccessful, they downed shutters and Kanhaiyalal decided to seek a film career in Bombay. His elder brother Sankatha Prasad Chaturvedi had already set a precedent. He established himself as an actor in silent films, but Kanhaiyalal came to films without the intention of acting, wanting to write and direct instead. Eventually capitulating, he began by working as an extra in Sagar Movietone's Sagar Ka Sher. He would have remained a background extra but for a fated twist.    Career  He was fond of plays and came to Mumbai to find a space on stage. He staged his own written play Pandrah August in Mumbai, and later he tried his luck in films. He also wrote many plays. In the 1939 film Ek Hi Raasta as Banke, he got a break in Hindi films and in 1940 he got the role of the moneylender (Sahukar) in Mehboob Khan's film Aurat as Sukkhi Lala. After that, he later acted in many films as a character artist. When Mehboob Khan directed his film Mother India which was a remake of his earlier film 'Aurat', he again picked Kanhaiyalal to act as Sukkhi Lala, a character that came alive with his natural acting. Some of the performances of Kanhaiyalal which were appreciated by the audience for his versatility include his characters in the films Bhookh (1947), Ganga Jamuna, Upkar, Apna Desh, Janta Hawaldar, Dushman, Bandhan, Bharosa, Dharti Kahe Pukar Ke, Hum Paanch, Gaon Hamara Desh Tumhara, Dadi Maa, Gruhasti, Hatyara, Palkon Ki Chhaon Mein, Heera, Teen Bahuraniyan, Dost etc. His memorable roles include those as villainous scheming moneylenders in the films Mother India , Ganga Jamuna, and Upkaar. As he recalled in an interview, \"An actor playing Motilal's father had not reported on the sets, so there was an opportunity to step into the breach. The dialogue I had to speak ran to a full sheet of foolscap paper. Almost everyone on the sets was ready to laugh at me trying to be an actor, but God helped me and I did my job.\" The film was Jhul Badn, written by K. M. Munshi (the founder of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan), directed by Sarvottam Badami and starring Motilal and Sabita Devi. To his delight, his talkie debut fetched him a ten-rupee increment as his salary rose to Rs 45 a month. \"Another promotion I earned was to play grandfather instead of father. This was in Sadhana (Old), also by Sagar Movietone. My grandson Prem Adib was the hero of the film. That was my first big role after which I became 'acceptable'. I was quite young but I thus started playing old roles. And, down the years, I got older and older but my roles didn't grow younger and younger!\" For Sadhana, he also wrote the dialogues and lyrics. In fact, it was while he was reading out the dialogues he had written that Chimanlal Desai, proprietor of Sagar, made him an offer to enact the role. \"I must also put it on record that when the film was being made, quite a number of people thought I was bogus and withheld cooperation. However, the film was a big hit and achieved a silver jubilee at Imperial Cinema.\" Getting frustrated at not getting the chance to direct a film, however, after Sadhana, Kanhaiyalal went home to Varanasi. When he returned to Bombay, it was with the understanding that he would help Virendra Desai (son of Sagar Movietone boss, Chimanlal Desai).

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: What is the place of birth of Abdullah Ibn Hasan's father?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe Sharifate of Mecca (Arabic: شرافة مكة, romanized: Sharāfat Makka) or Emirate of Mecca was a state, non-sovereign for much of its existence, ruled by the Sharif of Mecca. A sharif is a descendant of Hasan ibn Ali, Muhammad's grandson. In Western sources, the prince of Mecca was known as Grand Sherif, but Arabs have always used the appellation \"Emir\". The Sharifate existed from about 967 to 1916, when it became the Kingdom of Hejaz. From 1201, the descendants of the Sharifian patriarch Qatada ruled over Mecca, Medina and the Hejaz in unbroken succession until 1925. Originally a Zaydi Shi'ite emirate, the Hasanid Sharifs converted to the Shafi'i rite of Sunni Islam in the late Mamluk or early Ottoman period. Their Husaynid kin who traditionally ruled over Medina professed Twelver Shi'ism. Both the Hasanid sharifs in Mecca and Husaynid sharifs in Medina converted to Sunnism in the Mamluk period, however, Mamluk and Ottoman sources hint towards continued Shia sympathies from among the ruling Hasanids and Husaynids after their conversion to Sunnism.    Pre-Ottoman History  Originally, the sharifs of the Hejaz had generally avoided involvement in public life. This situation changed in the second half of the 10th century, with the rise of the Qarmatian sect. The Qarmatians directed tribal raids towards Iraq, Syria and much of Arabia, interrupting the flux of pilgrims to Mecca. In 930, Qaramita raiders sacked Mecca, and stole the holy Black Stone from the Kaaba, gravely embarrassing the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. The Qarmatians returned the Black Stone in 951 and came to an accommodation with Baghdad, ceasing their attacks on the pilgrim caravans in exchange for money to protect them, but the extension of Qarmatian power in the middle of the 9th century effectively severed the routes between Iraq and the Hejaz. As a result, the holy cities turned towards Egypt, from which they received most of their grain, for support; during the rule of Abu al-Misk Kafur, nominally an Abbasid vassal but de facto independent, even the Abbasid caliphal prerogative of sending a ceremonial crown, the shamsa, to be hanged before the Kaaba, was usurped by the Egyptian ruler. As a measure to enhance the safety of the pilgrims he chose one of the sharifs of Hejaz, and installed him as emir of Mecca in about 964. The Egyptian suzerainty over the Muslim holy places was solidified after the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969, when the Fatimid caliphs restored the safety of the Hajj routes and sent annually rich gifts to the sharifs of the Hejaz. In 1012, the Emir of Mecca Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan declared himself caliph, but he was persuaded to give up his title in the same year. The first Sulayhid ruler conquered the whole of Yemen in 1062, and proceeded northwards to occupy the Hejaz. For a time, they appointed the Emirs of Mecca. As Sunni power began to revive after 1058, the Meccan emirs maintained an ambiguous position between the Fatimids and the Seljuks of Isfahan. After Saladin overthrew the Fatimids in 1171, the Ayyubids aspired to establishing their sovereignty over Mecca. Their constant dynastic disputes, however, led to a period free of external interferences in the Hejaz. By circa 1200, a sharif by the name of Qatadah ibn Idris seized power and was recognised as Emir by the Ayyubid sultan. He became the first of a dynasty, the Banu Qatadah, that held the emirate until it was abolished in 1925. The Mamluk Sultanate succeeded in taking over Hejaz, and made it a regular province of their empire after 1350. Jeddah became a base of the Mamluks for their operations in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, leading it to replace Yanbu as the main maritime trade centre on the Hejaz coast. By playing off members of the sharifian house against one another, the Mamluks managed to achieve a high degree of control over the Hejaz.    Ottoman era   During the Ottoman period the Emirate was not hereditary, and owed its succession to direct nomination by the Ottoman Porte. Abdullah ibn Atik was a companion of Muhammad. He participated in the Expedition of' Abdullah ibn' Atik where he successfully assassinated Sallam ibn Abu al- Huqayq. Where he led a group of men from the Banu Khazraj tribe. He was killed in the Battle of Yamama. Abu Rafi's assassination at the hands of Abdullah ibn Atik is mentioned in many Sunni Hadith: Abu Rafi's assassination is mentioned in:,, and many more. Zaydism (Arabic: الزَّيْدِيَّة, romanized: az-Zaydiyya) is one of the three main branches of Shia Islam that emerged in the eighth century following Zayd ibn Ali‘s unsuccessful rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate. Zaydism is typically considered to be a branch of Shia Islam that comes closest to the Sunni, although the \"classical\" form of Zaydism (usually referred to as Hadawi) over the centuries had changed its posture with regard to Sunni and Shia traditions multiple times, to the point where interpretation of Zaydi as Shia is often based on just their acceptance of Ali as a rightful successor to prophet Muhammad. Zaydis regard rationalism as more important than Quranic literalism and in the past were quite tolerant towards Sunni Shafi'ism, a religion of about half of the Yemenis. Most of the world's Zaydis are located in Northern Yemen, and in the Saudi Arabian area of Najran.    History  In the 7th century some early Muslims expected Ali to become a first caliph, successor to Muhammad. After ascension of Abu Bakr, supporters of Ali (and future Shia) continued to believe only people from the Prophet's family to qualify as rulers and selected one leader, imam, from each generation (the proto-Sunni, in contrast, recognized Abu Bakr as a legitimate first caliph). The Zaydis emerged in reverence of Zayd ibn Ali's failed uprising against the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik (r. 724–743). While a majority of the early Shia recognized Zayd's brother, Muhammad al-Baqir, as the fifth leader, some considered Zayd as the fifth imam, and thus in the 8th century formed the Zaydi or \"Fivers\" offshoot of Islam. The Zaydis formed the states in what is now known as northern Iran (Tabaristan, 864 CE, by Hasan ibn Zayd, expanded to Daylam and Gilan) and later in Yemen (893 CE, by al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya). The Zaydis on the Caspian Sea were forcefully converted to Twelver Shi'ism in the 16th century. The Zaydis in Yemen had initially lived in the highlands and the northern territories, but extent of their dominance away from their capital of 7 centuries, Saada, had been changing over time. Rassid dynasty was established after an Ottoman invasion in the 16th century. After another interaction with Ottomans, a new succession line was started in the 19th century by Muhammad bin Yahya Hamid ad-Din. With minor interruptions, these two dynasties ruled in Yemen until the creation of Yemen Arab Republic in 1962. While the rulers ostensibly conformed to Hadawi law (thus the \"imamate\"), the doctrines had to be modified to allow hereditary, as opposed to traditional merit-based, selection of imams. The end of imam rule in 1962, with the new rulers in Yemen no longer conforming to the requirements of Zaydism, caused Zaydi scholars to call for the restoration of the imamate. This contributed to the North Yemen Civil War that lasted from 1962 to 1970. The national reconciliation of 1970 paused the fighting with traumatized Zaydis following three main routes:  joining the new political system (the religious Party of Truth was created in 1990); restoring the spiritual and cultural heritage of Zaydism by opening religious centers and encouraging the tribes to send their youth for education there; preparing for the future fighting (Houthi movement founder Hussein al-Houthi was readying the militia).    Law  In matters of Islamic jurisprudence, the Zaydis follow Zayd Ibn 'Ali's teachings which are documented in his book Majmu’ Al-Fiqh (Arabic: مجموع الفِقه). Zaydi fiqh is similar to the Hanafi school of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, as well as the Ibadi school. Abu Hanifa, the founder of the Hanafi school, was favorable and even donated towards the Zaydi cause. Zaydis dismiss religious dissimulation (taqiyya). Zaydism does not rely heavily on hadith, but uses those that are consistent with the Qur'an, and is open to hadith. ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib (Arabic: عَبْد ٱللَّٰه ٱبْن عَلِيّ ٱبْن أَبِي طَالِب) was one of Ali's sons who was killed in Karbala in 680, and is considered among the martyrs of the Battle of Karbala. Abdullah is also among the four sons of Umm al-Banin, the daughter of Hazam. His kunya was Abu Muhammad.\n\n\n== Battle of Karbala ==\n\nHistorians have written about Abdullah ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib that on the day of Ashura, when the companions of Husayn ibn Ali and many of his family were killed, Abbas ibn Ali called out his brothers in age order and told them to attack on the battlefield. Abdullah ibn Ali was the first one who was called in order to fight Umar ibn Sa'd's army. Abbas said to him:\n\"O my brother, you first go to the battle field, because you don't have children (to be sad of the kid(s)). I want to see you to be killed in the way of Allah, and to be patient in your martyrdom.\"\nSo Abdullah went to the battlefield and recited epic verse(s).  Then he embarked onto the battlefield striking out with his sword.  Eventually Hani ibn Thabit attacked him and struck Abdullah on his head killing him.  He was twenty five years old. Hani ibn Thabit's name was mentioned in the Ziyarat al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa and by Ja'far ibn Ali ibn Abi as the killer of Abdullah Talib.\n\n\n== References == Hasan ibn Ali ibn Muhammad (Arabic: الحَسَن بْن عَلِيّ بْن مُحَمَّدُ, romanized: al-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad; c. 846 – 874), better known as Hasan al-Askari (Arabic: الحَسَن ٱلْعَسْكَرِيّ, romanized: al-Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī), was a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He is regarded as the eleventh of the Twelve Imams, succeeding his father, Ali al-Hadi. Hasan Al-Askari was born in Medina in 844 and brought with his father to the garrison town of Samarra in 848, where the Abbasid caliphs held them under close surveillance until their deaths, even though neither were politically active. After the death of al-Hadi in 868, the majority of his following acknowledged his son, al-Askari, as their next Imam. Al-Askari's contact with the Shia population was restricted by the caliphs and instead he communicated with his followers through a network of representatives. He died in Samarra in 873–874 at the age of about twenty-eight and was buried in the family home next to his father, which later developed into al-Askari shrine, a major center for Shia pilgrimage. Shia sources commonly hold the Abbasids responsible for the death of al-Askari and his father. A well-known early Shia commentary of the Quran is attributed to al-Askari. Al-Askari died without leaving an obvious heir, which created widespread confusion and fragmented the Shia community into several sects, all of which disappeared within a few decades except the Twelver Shia. The Twelvers hold that al-Askari had a son, commonly known as Muhammad al-Mahdi (lit. 'the rightly guided'), who was kept hidden from the public out of the fear of Abbasid persecution. Al-Mahdi succeeded to the imamate after the death of his father and entered a state of occultation. His life is said to be miraculously prolonged until the day he manifests himself again by God's permission to fill the earth with justice. Though in occultation, the Imam still remains responsible in Twelver belief for the spiritual guidance of humankind and the Shia accounts of his occasional encounters with the pious are numerous and popular.    Titles  Hasan ibn Ali is known by the titles al-Samet (lit. 'the quiet'), al-Hadi (lit. 'the guide'), and al-Zaki (lit. 'the pure'), though his most common title is al-Askari (lit. 'military')، on the account of his almost life-long detention in Samarra, a garrison town not far from Baghdad which was the capital of the Abbasids at the time. As a great-grandson of Ali al-Rida, the eighth of the Twelve Imams, Hasan was also known by his contemporaries as Ibn al-Rida (lit. 'son of al-Rida').    Birth and early life  Most Shia sources state that Hasan ibn Ali was born in Rabi' al-Awwal 230 AH (November 844), though other given dates range from 845 to 847. The Shia currently celebrate 8 Rabi' al-Thani as his birthday. Hasan was born in Medina, though Donaldson has cast doubt on this, as he is uncertain between Medina and Samarra. His father was the tenth Shia Imam, Ali al-Hadi, and his mother was a freed slave (umm walad), whose name is variously given as Hudayth, Susan, or Salil in different sources. At the age of about two, Hasan was brought to Samarra with his father in 233 or 234 AH (847–849), where the latter was held under close surveillance by the Abbasid caliphs until his death in 254 (868), some twenty years later. When Hasan was about twenty-two, an agent of his father is said to have providentially bought a Byzantine concubine, named Narjis (Narcissus), who was given to Hasan in marriage, and later bore him his only son. Other sources give her name variously as Sayqal, Sawsan, and Rayhana. The detailed accounts of Majlesi and Tusi describe Narjis as a captured granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor and a pious woman who was told in a dream about her future union with Hasan, though these accounts have been described as hagiographic. Abid Hasan( born 29 April 1995) is a Pakistani first- class cricketer who plays for Rawalpindi. Al-Qāsim ibn al-Ḥasan (Arabic: القاسم بن الحسن) (Sha'ban 7, 47 AH / October 4, 667 CE in Medina – Muharram 10, 61 AH / October 10, 680 CE in Karbala) was the son of Hasan ibn Ali. He supported his uncle Husayn ibn Ali in fighting off the Umayyad forces during the Battle of Karbala where he was killed at the age of 13.    Early life  Qasim was born the son of Hasan ibn Ali, the second Imam, and his wife Umm Farwa. His father was the elder son of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatima. Qasim was thus a great-grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who was the father of Fatima.    Death of Hasan ibn Ali   Hasan ibn Ali, Qasim's father died on the 28th Safar 50 AH (2 April 670 CE) by Mu'awiya I due to poisoning. Qasim was only three years old when his father died. However he grew up in the company of his paternal family. Like his cousins, Awn and Muhammad, the sons of his paternal aunt Zaynab bint Ali, Qasim was taught fencing by his uncle Abbas ibn Ali and cousin Ali al-Akbar ibn Husayn. When Hasan's brother Husayn ibn Ali prepared to leave Medina in 680, Qasim's mother Umm Farwa asked Husayn to take her and the young Qasim with him.    Battle of Karbala   Prior to his death, the Umayyad ruler Mu'awiya I appointed his son, Yazid I as his successor. Yazid tried to desire religious authority by obtaining the allegiance of Husayn ibn Ali, but Husayn would not give up his principles. After the people of Kufa sent letters to Husayn and asking his help and pledging their allegiance to him, Husayn and his family members (including Qasim) and his companions traveled from Mecca to Kufa in Iraq but were forced to camp in the plains of Karbala by Yazid's army of 30,000 men. Husayn and most of his family and companions, including Qasim ibn Hasan,  were killed and then beheaded in the Battle of Karbala on 10 October 680 (10 Muharram 61 AH) by Yazid, and the women and children were taken as prisoners.    Battle  Qasim asked his uncle, \"Will I also be among the martyrs?\" Husayn ibn Ali replied: \"How do you see death?\" Qasim said, \"O uncle, death to me is sweeter than honey.\"    Ashura  On the day of Ashura, Qasim, like other cousins before him, went to his uncle to ask for permission. Husayn would not permit him to fight because he was too young and Husayn could not bear the thought of anything happening to him. Qasim asked many times before going to his mother. When his mother saw that her son was upset, she gave him a letter that Qasim's father had written before he died. The letter stated:  My son Qasim, a day will come when my brother Husayn will be facing an enemy army of tens of thousands. That will be the day when Islam will need to be saved by sacrifice. You must represent me on that day. Qasim read the letter and gave to his uncle. After reading the letter Husayn said,  O my brother's son, how can I stop you from doing what your father wanted you to do? In the Name of Allah, go! Allah be with you!\" He went to the battlefield and killed many fighters. A man came from behind and struck Qasim on the head. He fell to the ground, bleeding heavily. He called out for his uncle. Husayn and Abbas rushed over. The army of Yazid got scared thinking they were coming to attack them, creating confusion. Horses began running from one side to another, trampling and killing Qasim. Husayn and Abbas called out for him, but no reply came. When they found his body Husayn as took off his abaa and with Abbas collected his remains.    Burial  On 10 October 680 (Muharram 10, 61 AH), the day of Ashura, Qasim ibn Hasan was killed near the Euphrates, where Husayn and his followers were not allowed to get water. All the 72 companions of Husayn, including Qasim ibn Hasan were buried in a mass grave. He was the father of Obata Masamori. Fadl ibn Abbas( 611-639) was a brother of Abdullah ibn Abbas and was a cousin of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī (Arabic: عبد الله بن الحسن بن علي) was the son of Hasan ibn Ali. He went to Karbala with his uncle Husayn ibn Ali, and was killed at the Battle of Karbala. His name was mentioned in Ziyarat al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa.\nAccording to Shia Muslims, Abd Allah ibn al-Hasan was 11 years old when he was killed in the Battle of Karbala. During the last moments of Husayn ibn Ali's life, Bahr ibn Ka’ab was about to strike him when Abd Allah came running out of the tents. He stood in his way and shouted \"O, son of the corrupt woman! Are you going to strike my uncle?\". Abd Allah shielded Husayn from the stroke of the sword, whereby his hand got cut and began to dangle. Abd Allah cried \"O, uncle\". Husayn took hold of his nephew, drew him to his chest and said \"O, son of my brother! Bear patiently what you have suffered, and consider it good, because Allah will make you meet your pious forefathers.\" At that point Harmala ibn Kahil threw an arrow at Abd Allah, and killed him in his uncle's arms.\n\n\n== References == Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Abi Talib (624–670 CE), sometimes spelled Hasan or Hassan, was the eldest son of Ali and Muhammad's daughter Fatimah, and was the older brother of Husayn. Muslims respect him as a grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Among Shia Muslims, Hasan is revered as the second Imam. Hasan was elected for the caliphate after his father's death, but abdicated after six or seven months to Muawiyah I, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty to end the First Fitna. Al-Hasan was known for donating to the poor, his kindness to the poor and bondmen, and for his knowledge, tolerance and bravery. For the rest of his life, Hasan lived in Medina, until he died at the age of 45 and was buried in the Jannat al-Baqi cemetery in Medina. His wife, Ja'da bint al-Ash'at, is commonly accused of having poisoned him. Hasan ibn Ali (Arabic: الْحَسَنِ بْن عَلِيّ, romanized: al-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī; c. 625 – 2 April 670) was an Alid political and religious leader. The eldest son of Ali and Fatima and a grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Hasan briefly ruled as Rashidun caliph from January 661 until August 661. He is considered as the second Imam in Shia Islam, succeeding Ali and preceding his brother Husayn. As a grandson of the prophet, he is part of the ahl al-bayt and the ahl al-kisa, and also participated in the event of mubahala. During the caliphate of Ali (r. 656–661), Hasan accompanied him in the military campaigns of the First Fitna. Following Ali's assassination in January 661, Hasan was acknowledged caliph in Kufa. His sovereignty was not recognized by Mu'awiya I (r. 661–680), the governor of Syria, who led an army into Kufa while pressing Hasan for abdication in letters. In response, Hasan sent a vanguard under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Abbas to block Mu'awiya's advance until he arrived with the main army. Meanwhile, Hasan was severely wounded in an abortive assassination attempt by the Kharijites, a faction opposed to both Ali and Mu'awiya. This attack demoralized Hasan's army and led to widespread desertion. Ubayd Allah and most of his troops also defected after Mu'awiya bribed him. In August 661, Hasan signed a peace treaty with Mu'awiya on the condition that the latter should rule in compliance with the Quran and the sunna, a council should appoint his successor, and Hasan's supporters would receive amnesty. Hasan retired from politics and abdicated in Medina where he died either from illness or poisoning, though the early sources are nearly unanimous that he was poisoned. Mu'awiya is commonly viewed as the instigator in the murder of Hasan, which removed an obstacle to the succession of his son Yazid I (r. 680–683). Critics of Hasan call his treaty with Mu'awiya an indication of weakness, saying that he intended to surrender from the beginning. Given Mu'awiya's military superiority, supporters of Hasan maintain that his abdication was inevitable after his soldiers mutinied and that he was motivated by the desire for unity and peace among Muslims, which was reportedly predicted by Muhammad in a Sunni hadith. Another Sunni hadith, also attributed to Muhammad, predicted that the prophetic succession would last for thirty years, which may have been interpreted by some early Sunni scholars as evidence that Hasan's caliphate was rightly-guided (rāshid). In Shia theology, the divine infallibility (isma) of Hasan as the second Shia Imam further justified his course of action. As the rightful successor of Muhammad in Shia Islam, Hasan's all-inclusive temporal and religious authority came from divinely-inspired designation (nass), which was not annulled by abdication to Mu'awiya, who usurped only the temporal authority. The imamate and caliphate are viewed as separate institutions in Shia Islam until such time that God would make the Imam victorious.    Early life     Birth  Hasan was born in Medina in c. 625. Sources differ on whether he was born in the Islamic months of Sha'ban or Ramadan, though most early works give his birthdate as 15 Ramadan 3 AH (2 March 625 CE), which is annually celebrated by the Shia. Hasan was the firstborn of Muhammad's daughter Fatima and his cousin Ali. Their union holds a special spiritual significance for Muslims, write Nasr and Afsaruddin, and Muhammad said he followed divine orders to marry Fatima to Ali, narrates the Sunni al-Suyuti (d. 1505), among others. Ali reportedly had chosen another name in Sunni sources but deferred to Muhammad who named the child Hasan (lit. 'good, virtuous'). To celebrate his birth, Muhammad sacrificed a ram, while Fatima shaved Hasan's head and donated the weight of his hair in silver.    Lifetime of Muhammad  Hasan was raised in Muhammad's household until the age of seven when his grandfather died. Early sources widely report Muhammad's love for Hasan and his brother Husayn, saying that Muhammad allowed the boys to climb on his back while he was prostrate in prayer, and interrupted a sermon to pick Hasan up after his grandson fell. Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Hashimi (Arabic: أَبُو مُحَمَّد الْحَسَنِ بْنِ الْحَسَنِ بْنِ عَلِي ٱلْهَاشِمِي, romanized: Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥasan ibn al-Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī al-Hāshimī; c. 661–715) was an Islamic scholar and theologian. He was a son of Hasan ibn Ali and Khawla bint Manzur. He was a grandson of the fourth caliph Ali (r. 656–661) and a great-grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\nAl-Hasan ibn al-Hasan was a contemporary of Umayyad caliph al-Walid I.\n\n\n== Life ==\nHasan was born in Medina in c. 661. His father Hasan ibn Ali ruled briefly as caliph in 661 and was a grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Hasan's mother Khawla bint Manzur was a daughter of Manzur ibn Zaban, the chieftain of the Banu Fazara.\nHis mother was Khawla bint Manzur ibn Zaban ibn Sayyar Fazari. Hasan al-Muthanna was present in the Battle of Karbala. Ahmad ibn Ibrahim Hasani, in a tradition quoted from Abu Mikhnaf, he said that his age at that time was nineteen or twenty.\nOn the day of Ashura, he fought beside Imam Husayn and was injured and was kept as captive. His maternal uncle, Asma' ibn Kharijah Fazari, saved him. He was cured in Kufa; and after recovering, he returned to Medina.\nHasan ibn Hasan's uncle Husayn ibn Ali reportedly offered him to choose either of Husayn's two daughters Sukayna and Fatima, to be his wife. Hasan, who was too shy to accept, consequently chose Fatima, as she resembled his grandmother Fatima al-Zahra.\nThe caliph Al-Walid I had some correspondence with Al-Hassan Ibn Hassan through letters.\n\n\n=== Children ===\nSayyed Ibn Tawus writes about the merit and nobility of Hasan ibn Hasan and some other children of Imam Hasan: \"These are people whose lofty position and merit all Muslims acknowledged\".\nAccording to a part of a narration reported from Imam Reza about the continuation of the offspring of Imam Hasan and Imam Husayn, it is inferred that Hasan al-Muthanna had many children and Imam Hasan's offspring continued through him and another brother of his named Zayd. It has been reported in this tradition: \"Hasan ibn Ali's offspring continued through two of his sons named Zayd and Hasan. Zayd had a son whose name was Hasan. Also, Hasan al-Muthanna had sons named Abd Allah al-Mahd, Ibrahim al-Ghamr and Hasan al-Muthallath from Fatima bint Husayn; Ja'far and Da'wud from Umm al-Walad; Muhammad from Ramla bint Sa'id ibn Zayd; who continued a third generation of Imam Hasan.\"\nAlthough genealogically senior, Hasan's descendants never managed to establish serious claims to the imamate (other than Zaydism and Imams of Yemen). Moreover, many later shifted to Sunnism. The Banu Qatadah and the Hashemite dynasty claim descent from him.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMarsham, Andrew (2022). \"Kinship, Dynasty, and the Umayyads\".

He competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics. Hasan ibn Hasan (Arabic: حسن بن حسن, Hasan al-Muthana ibn Hasan ibn Ali, popularly known as Hasan al-Muthana) was a great-grandson of Muhammad. Abdullah ibn Hasan (Arabic: عبدالله بن حسن) was the son of Hasan ibn Ali. He went to Karbala with his uncle (Hussain), and finally was killed at the battle of Karbala. Also, his name has been mentioned in Ziyarat Nahiya Muqaddasa.  Abdullah ibn Unais was a companion( Sahaba) of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. He participated in several military campaigns ordered by Muhammad. The first was to kill Khaled bin Sufyan Al- Hathali who belonged to the Banu Lahyan tribe at the time of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. Muhammad alleged that he was planning on attacking Madinah and inciting the people of Nakhla and Uranah to attack him. Therefore he sent Abdullah ibn Unais to assassinate him in 625 during the Expedition of Abdullah Ibn Unais. Abdullah ibn Unais found Hudayr in the company of his wife, when asked about his identity. Unais replied:\" I am an arab tribesman who has heard of you and the Army you are raising to fight Muhammad, so i have come to join your ranks\" Then Muhammad sent him on the Expedition of Al Raji. Some men requested that Muhammad send instructors to teach them Islam, but the men were bribed by the two tribes of Khuzaymah who wanted revenge for the assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan by Muhammad's followers Beshr ibn Hasan( Arabic: بشر بن حسن) was a great- grandson of Muhammad. He was the son of second Shia Imam Hasan ibn Ali. He is considered to be one of the martyrs of the Battle of Karbala, although no record describes the circumstances surrounding his death by enemy forces. The first instance of Beshr ibn Hasan to be listed among the martyrs of Karbala was by Shia scholar Ibn Shahrashub. Of Hasan ibn Ali's twenty sons, seven participated in the battle, among them Beshr ibn Hasan. All but one brother was killed during the battle. In his account of their deaths, Shahrashub writes on Beshr:\" ... and it has been said that Beshr has been martyred, too.\" Among Beshr ibn Hasan's brothers who were present at the event of Ashura were Amrobne Hasan( who was killed in the event at Karbala when he was a child), Hasan ibn Hasan( who was famously known as' Hasan Muthanna'), Qasim ibn Hasan( who was also considered to be one of the martyrs of Karbala), Abdullah ibn Hasan( Abdullah Asghar). Husayn ibn Ali (Arabic: الحسين بن علي, romanized: al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī; 11 January 626 – 10 October 680) was a social, political and religious leader. The grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a son of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Muhammad's daughter Fatima, as well as a younger brother of Hasan ibn Ali, Husayn is regarded as the third Imam (leader) in Shia Islam after his brother, Hasan, and before his son, Ali al-Sajjad. Being the grandson of the prophet, he is also a prominent member of the Ahl al-Bayt. He is also considered to be a member of the Ahl al-Kisa, and a participant in the event of the mubahala. Muhammad described him and his brother, Hasan, as the leaders of the youth of Paradise. During the caliphate of Ali, Husayn accompanied him in wars. After the assassination of Ali, he obeyed his brother in recognizing the Hasan–Mu'awiya treaty, despite it being suggested to do otherwise. In the nine-year period between Hasan's abdication in AH 41 (660 CE) and his death in AH 49 or 50 (669 or 670 CE), Hasan and Husayn retreated to Medina, trying to keep aloof from political involvement for or against Mu'awiya. After the death of Hasan, when Iraqis turned to Husayn, concerning an uprising, Husayn instructed them to wait as long as Mu'awiya was alive due to Hasan's peace treaty with him. Prior to his death, Mu'awiya appointed his son Yazid as his successor, contrary to the Hasan–Mu'awiya treaty. When Mu'awiya died in 680, Yazid demanded that Husayn pledge allegiance to him. Husayn refused to do so. As a consequence, he left Medina, his hometown, to take refuge in Mecca in AH 60 (679 CE). There, the people of Kufa sent letters to him, invited him to Kufa and asked him to be their Imam and pledged their allegiance to him. On Husayn's way to Kufa with a retinue of about 72 men, his caravan was intercepted by a 1,000-strong army of the caliph at some distance from Kufa. He was forced to head north and encamp in the plain of Karbala on 2 October, where a larger Umayyad army of some 4,000 or 30,000 arrived soon afterwards. Negotiations failed after the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad refused Husayn safe passage without submitting to his authority, a condition declined by Husayn. Battle ensued on 10 October during which Husayn was martyred along with most of his relatives and companions, while his surviving family members were taken prisoner. The battle was followed by the Second Fitna, during which the Iraqis organized two separate campaigns to avenge the martyrdom of Husayn; the first one by the Tawwabin and the other one by Mukhtar al-Thaqafi and his supporters. The Battle of Karbala galvanized the development of the pro-Alid party (Shi'at Ali) into a unique religious sect with its own rituals and collective memory. It has a central place in the Shi'a history, tradition, and theology, and has frequently been recounted in Shi'a literature. For the Shi'a, Husayn's suffering and martyrdom became a symbol of sacrifice in the struggle for right against wrong, and for justice and truth against injustice and falsehood. It also provides the members of the Shi'a faith with a catalog of heroic norms. The battle is commemorated during an annual ten-day period during the Islamic month of Muharram by many Muslims especially Shi'a, culminating on tenth day of the month, known as the day of Ashura. On this day, Shi'a Muslims mourn, hold public processions, organize religious gathering, beat their chests and in some cases self-flagellate. Sunni Muslims likewise regard the incident as a historical tragedy; Husayn and his companions are widely regarded as martyrs by both Sunni and Shi'a Muslims.    Early life   According to majority of narrations, Husayn was born on the 3rd of Sha'ban 4 AH (11 January 626 CE) in Medina and was still a child when his grandfather, Muhammad, died. He was the younger son of Ali, the cousin of Muhammad, and Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, both from the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. Both Hasan and Husayn were named by Muhammad, although Ali had other names such as \"Harb\" in mind. The Sharif of Mecca (Arabic: شريف مكة, romanized: Sharīf Makkah) or Hejaz (Arabic: شريف الحجاز, romanized: Sharīf al-Ḥijāz) was the title of the leader of the Sharifate of Mecca, traditional steward of the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the surrounding Hejaz. The term sharif is Arabic for \"noble\", \"highborn\", and is used to describe the descendants of Hashim ibn Abd Manaf.\nThe Sharif was charged with protecting the cities and their environs and ensuring the safety of pilgrims performing the Hajj. The title is sometimes spelled Sheriff or  Sherif, with the latter variant used, for example, by T. E. Lawrence in Seven Pillars of Wisdom.\nThe office of the Sharif of Mecca dates back to the late Abbasid era. Until 1200, the Sharifate was held by a member of the Hashim clan, not to be confused with the larger clan of Banu Hashim from which all Sharifs claim descent. Descendants of the Banu Hashim continued to hold the position until the 20th century on behalf of various Muslim powers including the Ayyubids and the Mamluks. In 1517, the Sharif acknowledged the supremacy of the Ottoman Caliph, but maintained a great degree of local autonomy. During the Ottoman era, the Sharifate expanded its authority northwards to include Medina, hitherto a sharifate of its own, and southwards to the frontiers of 'Asir, and regularly raided Nejd.\nThe Sharifate came to an end shortly after the reign of Hussein bin Ali, who ruled from 1908, who rebelled against the Ottoman rule during the Arab Revolt of 1916. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 and its subsequent dissolution in 1923, Hussein formed the independent Kingdom of Hejaz and then declared himself Caliph. The British granted control over the newly formed states of Iraq and Transjordan to his sons Faisal and Abdullah. In 1924, however, in the face of increasing attacks by Ibn Saud, Hussein abdicated his political titles to his eldest son, Ali bin Hussein, who was to become the last Grand Sharif. At the end of 1925, Ibn Saud conquered the Hejaz and expelled the Hashemites. The House of Saud has ruled Mecca and Medina and overseen the Hajj (annual pilgrimage to Mecca) since that time.\n\n\n== List of Sharifs of Mecca (967–1925) ==\n\n\n=== During the Fatimid Dynasty (967–1101) ===\n\n\n=== During the Ayyubid Empire (1201–1254) ===\n\n\n=== 1250–1301 ===\n\n\n=== During the Mamluk Empire (1254–1517) ===\n\n\n=== During the Ottoman Empire (1517–1917) ===\n\n\n=== During the Kingdom of Hejaz (1916–1925) ===\n\n\n== Geneaology ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques\nHashemite custodianship of Jerusalem holy sites\nHejaz Vilayet\nKingdom of Hejaz\nBattle of Mecca (1916)\nBattle of Mecca (1924)\nSiege of Medina\nList of caliphs\nList of Sunni dynasties\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Did John Agoglia and John E. Toews have the same nationality?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nMiriam Toews ( ; born 1964)  is a Canadian writer and author of nine books, including A Complicated Kindness (2004), All My Puny Sorrows (2014), and Women Talking (2018). She has won a number of literary prizes including the Governor General's Award for Fiction and the Writers' Trust Engel/Findley Award for her body of work. Toews is also a three-time finalist for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and a two-time winner of the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize. Toews had a leading role in the feature film Silent Light, written and directed by Mexican filmmaker Carlos Reygadas, and winner of the 2007 Cannes Jury Prize, an experience that informed her fifth novel, Irma Voth (2011). Toews lives in Toronto and is an adjunct professor at the University of Toronto in the Faculty of Arts & Science.    Early life  Toews grew up in Steinbach, Manitoba, Canada the second daughter of Mennonite parents, both part of the Kleine Gemeinde. Through her father, Melvin C. Toews, she is a direct descendant of one of Steinbach's first settlers, Klaas R. Reimer (1837–1906), who arrived in Manitoba in 1874 from Ukraine. Her mother, Elvira Loewen, is a daughter of the late C. T. Loewen, an entrepreneur who founded a lumber business that would become Loewen Windows. As a teenager, Toews rode horses and took part in provincial dressage and barrel-racing competitions and attended high school at the Steinbach Regional Secondary School. She left Steinbach at eighteen, living in Montreal and London before settling in Winnipeg. She has a B.A. in Film Studies from the University of Manitoba, and a Bachelor of Journalism degree from the University of King's College, Halifax.    Career     Early work  Toews wrote her first novel, Summer of My Amazing Luck (1996), while working as a freelance journalist. The novel explores the evolving friendship of two single mothers in a Winnipeg public housing complex. The novel was developed from a documentary that Toews was preparing for CBC Radio on the subject of welfare mothers. It was shortlisted for the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour, and the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award. Toews won the latter prize with her second novel, A Boy of Good Breeding (1998). Toews has written for CBC's WireTap, Canadian Geographic, Geist, The Guardian, The New York Times Magazine, Intelligent Life, and Saturday Night. In 1999, she won a National Magazine Award Gold Medal for Humour. She is the author of The X Letters, a series of personal dispatches addressed to the father of her son, which were featured on This American Life in an episode about missing parents. Toews' father died by suicide in 1998. His death inspired Toews to write a memoir in her father's voice, Swing Low: A Life. The book was greeted as an instant classic in the modern literature on mental illness, and it won the Alexander Kennedy Isbister Award for Non-Fiction and the McNally Robinson Book of the Year Award.    A Complicated Kindness  Toews' third novel, A Complicated Kindness (2004), is set in East Village, a small religious Mennonite town much like her native Steinbach. The narrator is Nomi Nickel, a curious, defiant, sardonic sixteen-year-old who dreams of hanging out with Lou Reed in the 'real' East Village of New York City. She lives alone with her doleful father, after the departure of her older sister and the unexplained disappearance of her mother. Unlike her father, who is a dutiful member of the church, Nomi is rebellious by nature, and her questioning brings her into conflict with the town's various authorities, most notably Hans Rosenfeldt, the sanctimonious church pastor. A Complicated Kindness was highly acclaimed nationally and internationally, with the character of Nomi Nickel invoking comparisons to J. D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield. It won the 2004 Governor General's Award for Fiction, described by the jury as \"an unforgettable coming-of-age story... melancholic and hopeful, as beautifully complicated as life itself.\" It was also shortlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and longlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award.  The novel was selected for the 2006 edition of Canada Reads, the first book by a female writer to win the competition.    The Flying Troutmans  The Flying Troutmans (2008) is a road-trip novel narrated by 28-year-old Hattie, who takes charge of her teenage niece and nephew after her sister Min is admitted to a psychiatric ward.

James Robertson( 1911–1988) was a psychiatric social worker and psychoanalyst based at the Tavistock Clinic and Institute, London from 1948 until 1976. '( He) was a remarkable person who achieved great things. His sensitive observations and brilliant observations made history, and the courage with which he disseminated – often in the face of ignorant and prejudiced criticism – what were then very unpopular findings, was legendary. He will always be remembered as the man who revolutionised children's hospitals, though he accomplished much else besides. I am personally deeply grateful for all that he did.' – John Bowlby. Trade registers in several countries have the same English name: John Joseph Agoglia (September 24, 1937 – March 14, 2014) was an American television executive noted for his work at NBC from 1980 to 1998, including a tenure as President of NBC Enterprises. He was considered one of the network's top negotiators, often heading complicated negotiations between NBC and producers, actors and television studios. Agoglia was instrumental in the decision to replace Johnny Carson, the departing host of \"The Tonight Show\", with Jay Leno in 1992. Agoglia was born in Brooklyn, New York. His career began at Barclays Bank, before switching to the television industry. He worked as an executive at CBS for sixteen years before joining rival NBC in 1980. Agoglia moved to southern California permanently when he took the position at NBC. Agoglia worked directly under a string of well-known Presidents of NBC Entertainment and other executives, including Brandon Tartikoff, Warren Littlefield and Don Ohlmeyer. He earned a reputation as one of the network's toughest dealmakers. Agoglia led the often drawn-out negotiations with outside television studios and on-air talent. For example, Agoglia hammered out a deal with Paramount Studios for the renewal of \"Cheers\". He also negotiated the agreement to retain three cast members of Seinfeld - Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards - when each actor was demanding one million dollars per episode at the peak of the show's popularity. Agoglia played a significant role in the decision by NBC to name Jay Leno as the host of \"The Tonight Show\" over David Letterman in 1992. The move sparked controversy, as Letterman jumped to CBS after Leno's appointment. Agoglia's role in choosing Leno as Johnny Carson's successor was noted in the 1994 book, \"The Late Shift\", by \"New York Times\" journalist, Bill Carter. An HBO film adaptation of the book, \"The Late Shift\", aired in 1996. Agoglia was portrayed by actor Reni Santoni in the film. Agoglia led a multi-network 1993 boycott of the Emmy Awards, following a decision by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to air the awards exclusively on ABC. The Emmys had previously broadcast on the television networks on a rotating basis. Agoglia denounced the exclusivity agreement between ABC and the Emmys as \"bizarre at best\" and retaliated by boycott all Academy events, including the Primetime Emmy Awards. The Academy and the Emmys, under pressure from Agoglia's boycott, eventually relented and cancelled the deal with ABC. The Emmys returned to the previous agreement, in which the award show was broadcast on each of the four broadcast networks on a rotating basic each year. Agoglia rejoined the executive committee of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in 1994 after the deal with ABC was ended. On June 17, 1997, Agoglia announced his decision to retire from NBC. He left NBC in 1998 after eighteen years with the network. During his retirement Agoglia launched a Media Consulting firm; served as President of the Board of LAX Airport Commission; Served on board of directors of KCET Los Angeles; and was board chairman of the Los Angeles Universal Preschool Program. John Agoglia died on March 14, 2014, at the age of 76 following a three-year illness with cancer. He was survived by his sons, Anthony and John Steven, three grandchildren, and his brother, Thomas Agoglia. His wife, Joanne Agoglia, died in 2010.

David Longfen Ji is an American businessman who co-founded Apex Digital, an electronics manufacturer. In 2004, he was arrested in China following a dispute with Sichuan Changhong Electric, a supplier owned by the city of Mianyang and the province of Sichuan. Changhong accused him of defrauding them through bad checks. Ji was taken, according to an account by his lawyer, to the senior management and told, \"I decide whether you live or die.\" He has been held in China without charges. Ji's case highlighted an \"implicit racism\" in dealings with American businessmen. As a U.S. citizen he was not granted the same treatment by authorities as non-ethnically Chinese businessmen sharing the same nationality.

He was noted for playing Poppie on the television sitcom Seinfeld, Tony Gonzales in Cobra, and Chico González in Dirty Harry.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSantoni was born in New York City on April 21, 1938. His family was of Corsican and Spanish descent. He began his career in Off-Broadway theatre, writing the play Raisin' Hell in the Son which premiered in 1962. Reni is short for Renaldo.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSantoni's first significant film role was an uncredited appearance in the 1964 film The Pawnbroker (starring Rod Steiger), in which he played a junkie trying to sell a radio to the title character (using anti-Semitic slurs to no effect). His first leading role was as a young actor in Enter Laughing. He was cast into the role of delivery boy David Kolowitz after being scouted by Carl Reiner; the film was a semi-autobiographical story about the latter. Santoni went on to play Inspector \"Chico\" González in the 1971 film Dirty Harry. His character, who is a newcomer detective and college graduate in sociology, was initially dismissed by the title character as \"a college boy\". He ultimately uttered the memorable phrase, \"No wonder they call him Dirty Harry; [he] always gets the shit end of the stick\".\nSantoni again collaborated with Reiner in the comedic homage to film noir Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982). His other film roles during this decade included juvenile correction facility officer Ramon Herrera in Bad Boys (1983), as well as Detective Tony Gonzales in the action film Cobra (1986) opposite Sylvester Stallone. He featured in the short-lived series Sanchez of Bel Air and Manimal, in which he played Nick Rivera. He was described by Tracy Newman as having a completely different personality from the characters he played, which were most frequently cops, crime lords, or judges. She noted his reputation among friends as being \"the funniest guy in the room\".\nSantoni made guest appearances on television shows such as Barnaby Jones, Lou Grant, Hawaii Five-O, Hardcastle and McCormick, Hill Street Blues, The Odd Couple and Midnight Caller. In 1973, Santoni played a junior partner on Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law. His most notable later role was as Poppie, the bombastic, antiabortion, neurotic, and very unhygienic restaurateur in Seinfeld.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSantoni was married to Lisa James. He then had a long-term relationship with actress and director Betty Thomas, and a son named Nick.\n\n\n== Death ==\nSantoni died on August 1, 2020, at a hospice in Los Angeles at the age of 82.

Released by HBO Pictures and produced in conjunction with Northern Lights Entertainment, the film premiered on HBO on February 24, 1996. Based on Carter's 1994 book of the same name, the film chronicles the late-night television conflict between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 1990s, surrounding NBC's appointment of Leno to succeed Johnny Carson as host of The Tonight Show, and Late Night host Letterman's resulting efforts to negotiate out of his contract with the network to host his own competing talk show for CBS.    Plot  In 1991, behind-the-scenes network politics embroil television executives responsible for NBC's late-night programming. Johnny Carson has hosted The Tonight Show since 1962, but he and his audience are both growing older, leaving NBC to anticipate the day when a new host will be needed. Carson's then-permanent guest host, Jay Leno, and the host of the show that follows Carson's each night, David Letterman, both vie for Carson's job. It is widely assumed that Letterman is the hand-picked successor whom Carson favors, but NBC executives privately speculate that Leno could be more popular with audiences, as well as easier for the network to control. Moreover, NBC believes they have highly favorable contract terms with Letterman that will prevent him from leaving in any case. Leno's manager, Helen Kushnick, secures the spot for Leno with negotiating tactics that could be construed as either shrewd or unethical. Leno is concerned that Kushnick's methods might alienate Carson but does not wish to be disloyal, as he believes that she has been responsible for his success; in addition, he had promised to take care of her after her husband's death. Kushnick harshly instructs Leno to just keep telling jokes and leave the business end to her. Surely enough, Kushnick secures the producer's position for herself at The Tonight Show, on the condition that no public announcement will be made. Letterman continues to believe he is still in contention for the position. In the spring of 1991, Carson, feeling he is being pushed aside, unexpectedly announces his retirement. NBC executives inform an angry Letterman they have selected Leno to replace Carson. Leno takes over on May 25, 1992, but Kushnick's bullying manner angers his colleagues, potential guests and others to the point of interfering with network airtime and relations. Executives warn the mild-mannered Leno that they are going to fire Kushnick and, if he sides with her, he will be let go as well. Kushnick is dismissed by NBC and barred from the studio lot. Despite her pleas to keep his promise to take care of her, Leno is angry because she nearly cost him a dream job. After a heated argument, Leno fires Kushnick and ends their friendship. Later, Leno eavesdrops on a meeting in which NBC executives discuss the possibility of replacing him with Letterman. Letterman, devastated at being passed over, hires Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz to negotiate on his behalf. Ovitz promises that not only will Letterman be offered an 11:30 p.m. show, he will be offered it by every network. True to Ovitz's word, Letterman is courted by all the major networks and syndicates, albeit only informally after Ovitz learns that Letterman is contractually barred from negotiating with NBC's competitors. After securing more lenient terms from NBC, Ovitz receives a lucrative offer from CBS which effectively guarantees Letterman an 11:30 p.m show. Letterman provisionally accepts but continues to hold on to his lifelong dream of hosting The Tonight Show. Per Letterman's contract with NBC, the network still has several months to either match CBS's offer or present an acceptable counteroffer to keep Letterman. Producer Peter Lassally, close to both Carson and Letterman, finally convinces NBC to offer Letterman the Tonight Show position. However, NBC's offer is substantially weaker than CBS's and would force Letterman to wait until May 1994 to take over the show. Lassally, disappointed at NBC's offer, makes it clear to Letterman that the Tonight Show job is now \"damaged goods\" and Letterman would be working with the very people who passed him over and may yet double-cross him. In addition, Lassally warns Letterman that he will be vilified in the press for forcing Leno out. Taking Lassally's suggestion, Letterman calls Carson to ask for advice; Carson says he would probably leave NBC if he were in Letterman's position. Maqamat may have the following meanings.

He represented Provencher in the House of Commons of Canada from 2000 until his resignation on July 9, 2013, and served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, most recently as Minister of Public Safety.  He previously served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1995 to 1999, and was a senior cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon.  Prior to his appointment to the judiciary, Toews was a member of the Conservative Party of Canada.    Personal life  Toews was born September 10, 1952, in Filadelfia, Boquerón Department, Paraguay to Mennonite Canadian parents. His father, Victor David Toews, was a Reverend who was teaching in the Fernheim Mennonite Colony with Toews mother, Anna Peters. In 1920, his paternal great-grandparents were killed in a bomb blast during the Russian Civil War after the Russian Revolution. Vic Toews has five siblings: Bernhard, Clara, Marlene, Edward, and Esther. His family left Paraguay in 1956 for Canada and settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Toews speaks Mennonite Low German (his mother tongue), Spanish and English. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from the University of Winnipeg (1973), and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba (1976). Toews was called to the Manitoba Bar in 1977.  He joined the provincial Ministry of Justice in 1976 and became a Crown attorney the following year.    Divorce  Toews divorced from his wife of 30 years, Lorraine Kathleen Fehr, after it was discovered that he had fathered a child with a young Conservative Party staffer. In divorce documents, Fehr claimed Toews had a much earlier relationship with the family's child care provider. This incident later became publicized in February 2012, when an anonymous Twitter account (later discovered to be a Liberal Party staffer) began posting information from Toews' divorce affidavit (that were on the public record, filed with the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba) as reaction to the introduction of Bill-30.    Conviction  In 2005, Toews was charged with violating Manitoba's Election Finances Act in the 1999 provincial election. During the election cycle, it was discovered that his election campaign had spent $7,500 more than the allowed limit. Toews pleaded guilty, and was later convicted and fined $500.    Provincial politician  Toews joined the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 1989,  winning a seat in the 1995 election, by narrowly defeating NDP incumbent Harry Schellenberg in the north Winnipeg riding of Rossmere.  In 1999, the Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 1999 provincial election and Toews himself lost to Schellenberg in a rematch.    Minister of Labour  Toews was appointed to the cabinet of Premier Gary Filmon after the election, becoming Minister of Labour on May 9, 1995.  In his debut speech to the legislature, he said that his political philosophy was partly influenced by leaders of Canada's social democratic movement, as well as his own Mennonite upbringing. Toews's tenure as Labour Minister was marked by a difficult relationship with organized labour. His first major legislative initiative was Bill 26 (1996), which required unions to disclose the salaries of their officials and indicate how membership dues were spent, mandated union certification votes to take place within seven days of an application, and granted employees the right to prevent their dues from being donated to political parties. Several labour leaders described the bill as anti-union.  NDP leader Gary Doer argued that the provision regarding donations unfairly targeted his party, and suggested that corporate shareholders should be given the same right to shield their investments from party donations. Toews rejected these criticisms, and argued that Bill 26 provided greater autonomy to individual workers. Toews's department proposed the privatization of home-care delivery services in 1996, drawing opposition from many in the field and triggering an extended strike.  He was also forced to deal with strikes at Boeing, Inco, and the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation, leading one journalist to describe 1996 as \"the busiest year for picketing since the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike\". Toews blamed unions for provoking the strikes, saying they were conducted \"for political, not economic, reasons.\" Toews cancelled the provincial Payment of Wages Fund in July 1996, argued that it was not achieving its purpose. The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno, and the Network Battle for the Night is a 1994 non-fiction book written by The New York Times media reporter Bill Carter. It chronicles the early 1990s conflict surrounding the American late-night talk show The Tonight Show. The book was later made into a film of the same name by HBO.    Contents  The book chronicles the behind-the-scenes corporate battle surrounding American late-night talk shows, leading up to, and after, Johnny Carson's 1992 retirement as host of NBC's The Tonight Show. The book primarily details the power struggle between David Letterman and Jay Leno to succeed Carson as the \"King of Late Night\", NBC choosing Leno over Letterman as the next Tonight Show host, and Letterman later moving to rival network CBS.    Cast of characters  The following is a partial list of people featured in the book:  Major principals Johnny Carson: Host of The Tonight Show from 1962 to 1992. Jay Leno: Permanent guest host of The Tonight Show since 1987. Chosen by NBC to succeed Carson as host. David Letterman: Host of NBC's 12:30am show Late Night with David Letterman since 1982. After being bypassed as Carson's successor in favor of Leno, moves to rival network CBS in 1993. Others Helen Kushnick: Leno's tough manager who helps him secure his spot as Carson's successor. Becomes executive producer of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, but her fierce tactics eventually force both NBC and Leno to fire her. Peter Lassally: Executive producer of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and later Late Night with David Letterman. Becomes an unofficial counselor to Letterman after Leno is selected to succeed Carson. Michael Ovitz: Head of the Creative Artists Agency from 1975 to 1995. Hired by Letterman to negotiate his move from NBC to another network, studio, or syndicator (eventually CBS). Howard Stringer: President of CBS from 1988 to 1995. After several unsuccessful attempts to break NBC's ratings stranglehold on the late night hours, negotiates to bring Letterman to his network. Brandon Tartikoff: President of NBC's entertainment division from 1981 to 1991. Instrumental in helping to build NBC's 1980s late night lineup of Carson and Letterman, as well as signing Leno to be Carson's permanent guest host in 1987. Bob Wright: President of NBC from 1986 to 2007. Tries to negotiate to keep Letterman on NBC. John Agoglia: NBC executive from 1980 to 1998 and supporter of Leno.    Reception  In a review of The Late Shift for The New York Times Book Review, Jon Katz wrote, \"[This] is a reporter's book, unfailingly balanced, thoroughly researched, filled with scoops and fresh details. Even though CBS's wooing and winning of Mr. Letterman was the subject of enormous publicity, Mr. Carter's book makes clear that we knew less than we thought about what was really going on.\" Katz criticized the book for not going into more depth about Letterman's switch to CBS, writing, \"As readable as it is, 'The Late Shift' needed to take a more critical, detached look at the long-term significance of Mr. Letterman's move. A number of questions are not addressed.\" He concluded, \"'The Late Shift' is nonetheless a powerful story, and ultimately a sad one, filled with casualties as well as winners. Mr. Leno, who has been made to seem a second choice by the very people who elevated him, has been betrayed by his employers in the most basic of ways, and he has not yet recovered.\"  Kim Campbell reviewed the book for The Christian Science Monitor. \"More than just a play-by-play account of the actions that followed Johnny Carson's 1991 retirement announcement, Carter's well-written book is a look at the history of the late-night franchise, and of the men who host the shows that we would rather watch instead of going to bed.\" Campbell described the book as revealing in its assessment of NBC's decision to pass over Letterman for The Tonight Show, concluding, \"Carter's eye-opening book leaves the impression that NBC will be remembered more for its loss of Letterman, than for its role as creator of late-night television.\"    Lawsuit  Helen Kushnick, Jay Leno's manager at the time of Carson's retirement who was pushed out following her heavy-handed tactics, filed a $30 million lawsuit against Bill Carter, claiming libel. Specifically, her case related to a claim that she planted a story about Carson's retirement in a New York City tabloid. The then-pending lawsuit was noted in the closing credits of the film, as the Broadway tune \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" plays. The MacArthur Fellows Program, also known as the MacArthur Fellowship and colloquially called the \"Genius Grant\", is a prize awarded annually by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to typically between 20 and 30 individuals working in any field who have shown \"extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction\" and are citizens or residents of the United States.\nAccording to the foundation's website, \"the fellowship is not a reward for past accomplishments but rather an investment in a person's originality, insight, and potential\", but it also says such potential is \"based on a track record of significant accomplishments\". The current prize is $800,000 paid over five years in quarterly installments. Previously, it was $625,000. This figure was increased from $500,000 in 2013 with the release of a review of the MacArthur Fellows Program.  The award has been called \"one of the most significant awards that is truly 'no strings attached'\".\nThe program does not accept applications. Anonymous and confidential nominations are invited by the foundation and reviewed by an anonymous and confidential selection committee of about a dozen people. The committee reviews all nominees and recommends recipients to the president and board of directors.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When is the director of film Eclipse Of Reason 's birthday?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nEtan Boritzer( born 1950) is an American writer of children ’s literature who is best known for his book\" What is God?\" first published in 1989. His best selling\" What is?\" illustrated children's book series on character education and difficult subjects for children is a popular teaching guide for parents, teachers and child- life professionals. Boritzer gained national critical acclaim after\" What is God?\" was published in 1989 although the book has caused controversy from religious fundamentalists for its universalist views. The other current books in the\" What is?\" series include What is Love?, What is Death?, What is Beautiful?, What is Funny?, What is Right?, What is Peace?, What is Money?, What is Dreaming?, What is a Friend?, What is True?, What is a Family?, What is a Feeling?\" The series is now also translated into 15 languages. Boritzer was first published in 1963 at the age of 13 when he wrote an essay in his English class at Wade Junior High School in the Bronx, New York on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. His essay was included in a special anthology by New York City public school children compiled and published by the New York City Department of Education. Boritzer now lives in Venice, California and maintains his publishing office there also. He has helped numerous other authors to get published through\" How to Get Your Book Published!\" programs. Boritzer is also a yoga teacher who teaches regular classes locally and guest- teaches nationally. He is also recognized nationally as an erudite speaker on\" The Teachings of the Buddha.\" Eclipse of Reason is a 1987 anti-abortion documentary video directed, filmed, and narrated by Bernard Nathanson, with an introduction by Charlton Heston. \" Eclipse of Reason\" is a follow up to Nathanson’s first film \"The Silent Scream\". The film is perhaps most known for its controversial depiction of a dilation and evacuation (D&E) abortion. The subject matter of this film focuses more on the moral implications of abortion. It served as Nathanson’s call to the women of the world to end the practice of abortion. This film, as well as \"The Silent Scream\", was instrumental in the Right to Life Committee's garnering the attention of the United States public regarding the issue of abortion. \"Eclipse of Reason\" represented the argument that the fetus is human, and therefore abortion is murder. The film also serves to combat critics to \"The Silent Scream\" who argue that, although Nathanson claimed the film relied only on imagery and not pejorative speech, the film was heavily reliant on upon the language of the narrator. Therefore, \"Eclipse of Reason\" delivers the same message that abortion is murder, with similar imagery as its predecessor \"The Silent Scream\"; however, to avoid the previous appropriation of language over imagery \"Eclipse of Reason\" asks it viewers to consider reason rather than using emotionally charged narration. == Overview ==\n\nEclipse of Reason shows a late term abortion occurring sometime after the fourth month of pregnancy. The film focuses on the limbs of the fetus while in the womb then proceeds to show the abortion in graphic detail. While the fetus in Nathanson’s previous film was little more than a black and white pulsating image, the fetus in Eclipse of Reason was shown vividly in full color.\nDifferent women who have had abortions and suffered harmful effects from the procedure give testimony later in the film.\nNathanson concludes Eclipse of Reason with a montage of photographs that depicts his idea of opposing worlds, one filled with abortions and one without abortions. He argues that we cannot achieve a “World of Reason” without completely eliminating abortions.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAccording to Newsweek, the film is \"harder for critics to dismiss as misleading\" than was The Silent Scream.\nEclipse of Reason is most heavily criticized for its idealization of the “World of Reason” and for creating a dichotomy that may not exist in between the two hypothetical worlds. According to one set of critics Nathanson created a world of good (pro-life) versus evil (pro-choice), which directly opposed his intention of creating a film devoid of any sort of emotionally charged language. Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV. Escape from Freedom is a book by psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, first published in the United States by Farrar & Rinehart in 1941 with the title Escape from Freedom and a year later as The Fear of Freedom in UK by Routledge & Kegan Paul. It was translated into German and first published in 1952 under the title Die Angst vor der Freiheit (The Fear of Freedom). In the book, Fromm explores humanity's shifting relationship with freedom, how individual freedom can cause fear, anxiety and alienation, and how many people seek relief by relinquishing freedom. He describes how authoritarianism can be a mechanism of escape, with special emphasis on the psychosocial conditions that enabled the rise of Nazism.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCritical theory\nFreudo-Marxism\nLife Against Death\nPsychohistory\n\n\n== References == Terence D.

Max Horkheimer (; German: [ˈhɔɐ̯kˌhaɪmɐ]; 14 February 1895 – 7 July 1973) was a Jewish-German philosopher and sociologist who was famous for his work in critical theory as a member of the Frankfurt School of social research. Horkheimer addressed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis, and the poverty of mass culture using the philosophy of history as a framework. This became the foundation of critical theory. His most important works include Eclipse of Reason (1947), Between Philosophy and Social Science (1930–1938) and, in collaboration with Theodor Adorno, Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947). Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible.    Biography     Early life  On 14 February 1895, Horkheimer was born the only son of Moritz and Babetta Horkheimer. Horkheimer was born into a conservative, wealthy Orthodox Jewish family. His father was a successful businessman who owned several textile factories in the Zuffenhausen district of Stuttgart, where Max was born. Moritz expected his son to follow in his footsteps and own the family business.  Max was taken out of school in 1910 to work in the family business, where he eventually became a junior manager. During this period he would begin two relationships that would last for the rest of his life. First, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would later become a close academic colleague, and who would remain Max's closest friend. He also met Rose Riekher, his father's personal secretary. Eight years Max's senior, a Christian, and from a lower economic class, Riekher (whom Max called \"Maidon\") was not considered a suitable match by Moritz Horkheimer. Despite this, Max and Maidon would marry in 1926 and remain together until her death in 1969.  In 1917, his manufacturing career ended and his chances of taking over his family business were interrupted when he was drafted into World War I. However, Horkheimer avoided service, being rejected on medical grounds.    Education  In the spring of 1919, after failing an army physical, Horkheimer enrolled at Munich University. While living in Munich, he was mistaken for the revolutionary playwright Ernst Toller and arrested and imprisoned.  After being released, Horkheimer moved to Frankfurt am Main, where he studied philosophy and psychology under Hans Cornelius. There, he met Theodor Adorno, several years his junior, with whom he would strike a lasting friendship and a collaborative relationship. After an abortive attempt at writing a dissertation on gestalt psychology, Horkheimer, with Cornelius's direction, completed his doctorate in philosophy with a 78-page dissertation titled The Antinomy of Teleological Judgment (Zur Antinomie der teleologischen Urteilskraft).  In 1925, Horkheimer was habilitated with a dissertation entitled Kant's Critique of Judgment as Mediation between Practical and Theoretical Philosophy (Über Kants Kritik der Urteilskraft als Bindeglied zwischen theoretischer und praktischer Philosophie). Here, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would be his colleague at the Institute of Social Research. The following year, Max was appointed Privatdozent. Shortly after, in 1926, Horkheimer married Rose Riekher.    Institute of Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung)  In 1926, Horkheimer was an \"unsalaried lecturer in Frankfurt.\" Shortly after, in 1930, he was promoted to professor of philosophy at Frankfurt University. In the same year, when the Institute for Social Research's (now known as Frankfurt School of Critical Theory) directorship became vacant, after the departure of Carl Grünberg, Horkheimer was elected to the position \"by means of an endowment from a wealthy businessman\". The Institute had had its beginnings in a Marxist study group started by Felix Weil, a one-time student of political science at Frankfurt who used his inheritance to fund the group as a way to support his leftist academic aims. Pollock and Horkheimer were partners with Weil in the early activities of the institute. Horkheimer worked to make the Institute a purely academic enterprise. As director, he changed Frankfurt from an orthodox Marxist school to a heterodox school for critical social research. The following year publication of the institute's Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung began, with Horkheimer as its editor.  Horkheimer intellectually reoriented the institute, proposing a programme of collective research aimed at specific social groups (specifically the working class) that would highlight the problem of the relationship of history and reason. The Institute focused on integrating the views of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. A lunar eclipse is an astronomical event that occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow, causing the Moon to be darkened. Such an alignment occurs during an eclipse season, approximately every six months, during the full moon phase, when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to the plane of the Earth's orbit. This can occur only when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are exactly or very closely aligned (in syzygy) with Earth between the other two, which can happen only on the night of a full moon when the Moon is near either lunar node. The type and length of a lunar eclipse depend on the Moon's proximity to the lunar node. When the Moon is totally eclipsed by the Earth (a \"deep eclipse\"), it takes on a reddish color that is caused by the planet when it completely blocks direct sunlight from reaching the Moon's surface, as the only light that is reflected from the lunar surface is what has been refracted by the Earth's atmosphere. This light appears reddish due to the Rayleigh scattering of blue light, the same reason sunrises and sunsets are more orange than during the day. Unlike a solar eclipse, which can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth. A total lunar eclipse can last up to nearly two hours, while a total solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes at any given place, because the Moon's shadow is smaller. Also, unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view without any eye protection or special precautions. The symbol for a lunar eclipse (or indeed, any body in the shadow of another) is  (U+1F776 🝶).    Types of lunar eclipse  Earth's shadow can be divided into two distinctive parts: the umbra and penumbra. Earth totally occludes direct solar radiation within the umbra, the central region of the shadow. However, since the Sun's diameter appears to be about one-quarter of Earth's in the lunar sky, the planet only partially blocks direct sunlight within the penumbra, the outer portion of the shadow.    Penumbral lunar eclipse  A penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when part or all of the Moon's near side passes into the Earth's penumbra. No part of the moon is in the Earth's umbra during this event, meaning that on all or a part of the Moon's surface facing Earth, the sun is partially blocked. The penumbra causes a subtle dimming of the lunar surface, which is only visible to the naked eye when the majority of the Moon's diameter has immersed into Earth's penumbra. A special type of penumbral eclipse is a total penumbral lunar eclipse, during which the entire Moon lies exclusively within Earth's penumbra. Total penumbral eclipses are rare, and when these occur, the portion of the Moon closest to the umbra may appear slightly darker than the rest of the lunar disk.    Partial lunar eclipse  When the Moon's near side penetrates partially into the Earth's umbra, it is known as a partial lunar eclipse, while a total lunar eclipse occurs when the entire Moon enters the Earth's umbra. During this event, one part of the Moon is in the Earth's umbra, while the other part is in the Earth's penumbra. The Moon's average orbital speed is about 1.03 km/s (2,300 mph), or a little more than its diameter per hour, so totality may last up to nearly 107 minutes. Nevertheless, the total time between the first and last contacts of the Moon's limb with Earth's shadow is much longer and could last up to 236 minutes.    Total lunar eclipse   When the Moon's near side entirely passes into the Earth's umbral shadow, a total lunar eclipse occurs. Just prior to complete entry, the brightness of the lunar limb—the curved edge of the Moon still being hit by direct sunlight—will cause the rest of the Moon to appear comparatively dim. The moment the Moon enters a complete eclipse, the entire surface will become more or less uniformly bright, being able to reveal stars surrounding it. Later, as the Moon's opposite limb is struck by sunlight, the overall disk will again become obscured. This is because, as viewed from the Earth, the brightness of a lunar limb is generally greater than that of the rest of the surface due to reflections from the many surface irregularities within the limb: sunlight striking these irregularities is always reflected back in greater quantities than that striking more central parts, which is why the edges of full moons generally appear brighter than the rest of the lunar surface. This is similar to the effect of velvet fabric over a convex curved surface, which, to an observer, will appear darkest at the center of the curve. Roe v. Wade is a 2020 American political legal drama film produced, written and directed by Nick Loeb and Cathy Allyn. It serves as a dramatization of the 1973 landmark decision of the same name, rendered by the U.S. Supreme Court on the issue of the constitutionality of laws that criminalized or restricted access to abortions. The film stars a predominantly conservative ensemble cast, including Jon Voight, Stacey Dash and Robert Davi. Loeb also stars as Bernard Nathanson, a gynecologist who co-founded the abortion rights organization NARAL Pro-Choice America and later became an anti-abortion movement advocate. According to Loeb, the film is about \"the women's rights movement versus the pro-life movement. It's a social war movie where we take both sides of the argument and hopefully let the audience decide.\" The film, which received mostly negative reviews, was first screened at the Vienna Independent Film Festival in October 2020 and was released on April 2, 2021.    Plot  After experiencing a personal tragedy with his girlfriend relating to abortion, Dr. Bernard Nathanson (Nick Loeb) becomes a strong abortion advocate to make sure no woman has to go through what she went through. Together with journalist Larry Lader (Jamie Kennedy), they fight to legalize abortion across the country. Fighting against the anti-abortion lobby headed by Dr. Mildred Jefferson (Stacey Dash), the decision ends up in the U.S. Supreme Court leading to a verdict on abortion.

Wade had been filming since June 15, 2018, under the title 1973. The production was kept hidden from the media until a July 2018 report in The Hollywood Reporter revealed that shooting had taken place in Louisiana. Several cast and crew members (including the original director) left the project within the first few days of filming because of the anti-abortion theme of Loeb and Cathy Allyn's screenplay.  Loeb and Allyn stepped in as directors despite their lack of experience. One crew member told The Daily Beast, \"They're not keeping people in the loop with the script. When people finally receive the script, they've dropped out really fast.\" Rather than send scripts out in advance, lines were changed just before shooting. Some locations barred the filmmakers from shooting. Louisiana State University explained filming was not allowed there because of logistical issues and not the film's subject matter. Executive producer Alveda King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece, told Fox News the aim of the film is \"to educate the public\" with \"facts, no fake news\". Of the controversy surrounding the film, she acknowledged: \"Folks that are inside the set, inside the project, are getting pressure from Hollywood and from outside. They don't want the truth to come out. And so for various reasons, investors, donors, cast [and] crew are getting rattled from all this pressure.\" The film's unit production manager (UPM), though, disputed King's \"no fake news\" statement in a Salon report. The UPM told the website that he withdrew from the project the day before filming began because in his opinion the partial script he received contained historical inaccuracies but promoted them as factual.  For example, an early draft portrayed Margaret Sanger, founder of Planned Parenthood, as a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) sympathizer who disparaged Black people before 15 robed women during a cross burning, a claim which Sanger biographer Jean H. Baker declared false.    Reception  On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 14% of seven critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The Silent Scream is a 1984 anti-abortion film created and narrated by Bernard Nathanson, a former abortion provider who had become an anti-abortion activist. It was produced by Crusade for Life, Inc., an evangelical anti-abortion organization, and has been described as a pro-life propaganda film. The film depicts the abortion process via ultrasound and shows an abortion taking place in the uterus. During the abortion process, the fetus is described as appearing to make outcries of pain and discomfort. The video has been a popular tool used by the anti-abortion campaign in arguing against abortion, but it has been criticized as misleading by members of the medical community.    Development  Nathanson credits then-president Ronald Reagan for inspiring him to make The Silent Scream. In a speech to the Association of National Religious Broadcasters in January 1984, Reagan stated that a fetus suffers \"long and agonizing pain\" during an abortion.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a statement in response to the president's comment, saying that the neurological pathways necessary to experience pain do not begin to develop until the third trimester of pregnancy. Nathanson agreed with the president and issued a counterstatement. When critics continued to dispute that a fetus feels pain during the first two trimesters of pregnancy, Nathanson decided to make a movie, saying \"I mulled it over and thought there's only one way we can resolve this issue, and that's by photographing an abortion, beginning to end.\"    Overview  Nathanson, an anti-abortion (formerly pro-abortion rights) obstetrician, serves as both the medical expert and narrator of the film, describing the events of the abortion as they unfold. He begins by stating the viewer is about to witness the \"dazzling\" new \"science of fetology\" and to witness an abortion in real time \"from the victim's vantage point.\" The film compiled a series of still ultrasound images of the abortion of a twelve-week-old fetus (referred to as a child by Nathanson) spliced together to create the video. Nathanson displays the instruments used in a typical abortion and calmly demonstrates how each instrument is introduced into a woman's body during an abortion. Nathanson states that the head, even at 12 weeks' gestation, will be too large to enter the suction device and shows how forceps are used to crush the skull. He suggests that brain waves have been active for six weeks, though this is disputed by scientists. A television screen shows ultrasound images of a fetus. As the images of an abortion appear on the screen, Nathanson describes step-by-step what is taking place, pointing out new instruments that are introduced into the uterus. The suction cannula is described as a lethal weapon that will \"dismember, crush, and destroy\" the child. He narrates that the fetus is unprepared for the invasion of the womb and attempts to escape the cannula, describing it as a \"child being torn apart ... by the unfeeling steel instruments of the abortionist.\" He notes how the fetus's heartbeat speeds up and how it seems to open its mouth in a \"chilling silent scream.\" The film culminates in the now-famous \"silent scream\" which is accompanied with a shrill musical accompaniment. The film concludes by discussing the implications behind hiding this material from women. Nathanson states that he believes the film is necessary in keeping women informed on matters concerning abortion. This was the first time the images of an aborted fetus were given an electronic platform, as opposed to the printed form of the imagery used in prior years.    Reception  The Silent Scream was viewed by its producer and by the anti-abortion lobby as a tool capable of swaying public opinion against abortion. The film premiered on televangelist Jerry Falwell's program, and aired five times over the span of a month on major television networks. The film was later distributed widely to high schools and colleges and, according to Time magazine, \"embraced as an effective propaganda weapon by right-to-life organizations.\" The film was popular among people who opposed abortion, even being shown at the White House by then-President Ronald Reagan. Reagan said that \"if every member of Congress could see that film, they would move quickly to end the tragedy of abortion.\" The film's producers reportedly planned to send copies to every member of the United States Congress and to the Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States upon its release. Some opponents of abortion stated that the film gave a scientific basis to their position.    Medical community  Many members of the medical community were critical of the film, describing it as misleading and deceptive. Peter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre. Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America and commonly known as simply NARAL ( NAIR-əl), is a non-profit 501(c)(4) organization in the United States that engages in lobbying, political action, and advocacy efforts to oppose restrictions on abortion, to expand access to abortion and birth control, and to support paid parental leave and protection against pregnancy discrimination. NARAL is associated with the NARAL Pro-Choice America Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization, and the NARAL Pro-Choice America PAC, a political action committee. Founded in 1969, NARAL is the oldest extant abortion rights advocacy group in the United States, though it was predated by a few now-defunct groups including the Society for Humane Abortion and the Association for the Study of Abortion.    History  The precursor to NARAL was the Association to Repeal Abortion Laws (ARAL). ARAL was an expansion of the \"Army of Three\" which was made up of abortion rights activists Pat Maginnis, Rowena Gurner, and financial investor Lana Phelan. The Army of Three organized and distributed referral lists of people performing illegal abortions and held classes on do-it-yourself abortions in California.  Originally called the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, NARAL was established at the \"First National Conference on Abortion Laws: Modification or Repeal?\" held February 14–16, 1969, in Chicago. Its formation was announced on the front page of The New York Times. The conference, sponsored by 21 organizations and attended by 350 people, included a planning session for NARAL and the report of NARAL's pre-formation planning committee: Lawrence Lader of New York City, Garrett Hardin of California, and Dr. Lonny Myers of Chicago. Key conference speakers included obstetrician/gynecologist Bernard Nathanson (who later became an anti-abortion activist), journalist Lawrence Lader, and women's rights advocate Betty Friedan. The conference was split between those favoring abortion law \"reform\" and those favoring \"repeal\". The more conservative reform position would involve adopting something like the American Law Institute guidelines, which would liberalize existing abortion law by allowing abortion to preserve the physical or mental health of the mother, or in the case of pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. The repeal position, led by Betty Friedan and Conni Bille, favored \"ad libitum\" abortion rights at the discretion of the mother. The conference voted to adopt the more radical repeal position. Those agents attending the session elected a 12-person Planning Committee for NARAL's formation: Lawrence Lader (Chairman), Ruth Proskauer Smith (Vice-Chair), Ruth Cusack (Secretary), Beatrice McClintock (Treasurer), Constance Bille Finnerty (Secretary), Mrs. Marc Hughes Fisher, Betty Friedan, Norval Morris, Stewart Mott, Dr. Bernard Nathanson, Edna Smith, and Percy Sutton. The committee held its first official meeting in New York on February 25, 1969. It hired Lee Gidding as the first Executive Director; she opened NARAL's office in New York City on March 3. Several founding leaders, including Lader and Proskauer Smith, were previously active in the more conservative, pro-reform Association for the Study of Abortion founded in 1965. A number were also active in groups associated with the population movement, such as the Association for Voluntary Sterilization and Zero Population Growth. The Planning Committee, meeting regularly between February and September 1969, defined NARAL's purpose and program, drafted bylaws to submit to the membership for approval, prepared a slate to run for the Board of Directors, and directed NARAL's activities. The Committee defined NARAL's purpose as follows:  NARAL, recognizing the fundamental human right of a woman to limit her own reproduction, is dedicated to eliminating all laws and practices that would compel any woman to bear a child against her will. To that end, it proposes to initiate and co-ordinate political, social, and legal action of individuals and groups concerned with providing safe operations by qualified physicians for all women seeking them, regardless of economic status. The original NARAL program had six parts:  Assist in the formation in all states of direct political action groups dedicated to the purpose of NARAL; Serve as a clearinghouse for activities related to NARAL's purpose; Create new materials for mass distribution which tell the repeal story dramatically and succinctly; Train field workers to organize and stimulate legislative action; Suggest direct action projects; Raise funds for the above activities. The Board of Directors, elected by the membership, officially replaced the Planning Committee at the first Board meeting, held on September 27, 1969. The Board elected Honorary Officers (Co-Presidents Dr. Eclipse of Reason is a 1947 book by Max Horkheimer, a German philosopher and sociologist who was a key figure in the Frankfurt School of critical theory. In the book, Horkheimer argues that in modernity the concept of reason has been reduced to a mere instrument for achieving practical goals, rather than a means of understanding objective truth. He contends that this \"eclipse of reason\" has led to the rise of authoritarianism, as well as the dominance of a manipulative \"culture industry\" that serves the interests of those in power. Horkheimer asserts that to counter these trends, it is necessary to develop a more substantive and critical form of reason that is grounded in a commitment to human emancipation and the pursuit of a more just society.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nHorkheimer deals with the concept of reason within the history of western philosophy. He defines true reason as rationality, which can only be fostered in an environment of free, critical thinking. He details the difference between objective, subjective and instrumental reason, and states that we have moved from the former through the center and into the latter (though subjective and instrumental reason are closely connected). Objective reason deals with universal truths that dictate that an action is either right or wrong. It is a concrete concept, and a force in the world that requires specific modes of behavior. The focus in the objective faculty of reason is on the ends, rather than the means. Subjective reason is an abstract concept of reason, and focuses primarily on means. Specifically, the reasonable nature of the purpose of action is irrelevant - the ends only serve the purpose of the subject (generally self-advancement or preservation). To be \"reasonable\" in this context is to be suited to a particular purpose, to be \"good for something else\". This aspect of reason is universally conforming, and easily furnishes ideology. In instrumental reason, the sole criterion of reason is its operational value or purposefulness, and with this, the idea of truth becomes contingent on mere subjective preference (hence the relation with subjective reason). \nHorkheimer argues that modern philosophy has increasingly advocated subjective rationality to the point of rejecting any form of meaning or objective rationality and enabling technocracy. He associates the decline in objective rationality in philosophy with  a mechanical worldview, disenchantment and the decline of a belief in a living or holistic nature. Although he denounces a wide range of contemporary philosophical schools of thought, Horkheimer asserts that these trends are epitomized in positivism, a term he defines broadly. \n\nBecause subjective/instrumental reason rules, the ideals of a society, for example democratic ideals, become dependent on the \"interests\" of the people instead of being dependent on objective truths. Nevertheless, Horkheimer admits that objective reason has its roots in Reason (\"Logos\" in Greek) of the subject. He concludes, If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate – in short, the emancipation from fear – then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service we can render.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nHorkheimer's argument in Eclipse of Reason that social repression demands the repression of the natural environment and of human nature influenced later developments in ecofeminism.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEclipse of Reason.

Nathanson (July 31, 1926 – February 21, 2011) was an American physician and co-founder in 1969 of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL), later renamed National Abortion Rights Action League. He was also the former director of New York City's Center for Reproductive and Sexual Health but later became an anti-abortion activist. He was the narrator for the controversial 1984 anti-abortion film The Silent Scream.    Early life and education  Nathanson was born in New York City to a Jewish family. His father was an obstetrician/gynecologist, the same career that Nathanson held in his professional life. Nathanson earned his undergraduate degree at Cornell University, and in 1949 graduated with a medical degree from McGill University Faculty of Medicine in Montreal.    Career  Nathanson was licensed to practice medicine in New York state in 1952, and became board-certified in obstetrics and gynecology in 1960. He was for a time the director of the Center for Reproductive and Sexual Health (CRASH), then the largest free-standing abortion facility in the world. In 1974, Nathanson wrote: \"I am deeply troubled by my own increasing certainty that I had in fact presided over 60,000 deaths.\" He also wrote that he performed an abortion on a woman whom he had impregnated.    Activism     Pro-abortion rights  Originally an abortion rights activist, Nathanson gained national attention as one of the founding members, along with Lawrence Lader, of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (later renamed the National Abortion Rights Action League, and now known as Reproductive Freedom for All). He worked with Betty Friedan and others for the legalization of abortion in the United States. Their efforts essentially succeeded with the Roe v. Wade (1973) decision.    Anti-abortion  With the development of ultrasound in the 1970s, Nathanson had the chance to observe a real-time abortion. This led him to reconsider his views on abortion. He is often quoted as saying that abortion is \"the most atrocious holocaust in the history of the United States\". He wrote the book Aborting America in which he discussed what he called \"the dishonest beginnings of the abortion movement\". In 1983, Nathanson debated Henry Morgentaler for an hour on a Canadian national superstation. In 1984, Nathanson directed and narrated a film titled The Silent Scream, in co-operation with the National Right to Life Committee, which contained the ultrasound video of a mid-term (12 weeks) abortion. His second documentary, Eclipse of Reason, dealt with late-term abortions. He stated that the numbers he once cited for Naral concerning the number of deaths linked to illegal abortions were \"false figures\". Referring to his previous work as an abortion provider and abortion rights activist, he wrote in his 1996 autobiography Hand of God: \"I am one of those who helped usher in this barbaric age.\" Nathanson developed what he called the \"vector theory of life\", which states that from the moment of conception there exists \"a self-directed force of life that, if not interrupted, will lead to the birth of a human baby.\"    Religious conversion  Nathanson grew up Jewish, and for more than ten years after he became anti-abortion, he described himself as an \"atheist\". In 1996, he converted to Catholicism through the efforts of the Reverend C. John McCloskey. In December 1996, Nathanson was baptized by John Cardinal O'Connor in a private Mass with a group of friends in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. He also received Confirmation and first Communion from the cardinal. When asked why he converted to Roman Catholicism, he stated that \"no religion matches the special role for forgiveness that is afforded by the Catholic Church\".    Personal life and death   Nathanson married four times; his first three marriages ended in divorce. He died of cancer in New York on February 21, 2011, at the age of 84. He was survived by his fourth wife Christine Reisner-Nathanson whom he married in the church shortly after his 1996 baptism. He was also survived by his son Joseph, from his second marriage with wife Rosemary.    Works  Aborting America, Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1979. ISBN 0-385-14461-X.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Are both buildings, Santa María De Santa Cruz De La Serós and Newcastle Cruise Terminal, located in the same country?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nSan Caprasio is a church in Santa Cruz de la Serós, Jacetania, Spain, in First Romanesque style. Sancha Ramírez (born c. 1045, died 1097) was an Aragonese princess, the daughter of King Ramiro I and Queen Ermesinda. She was the countess of Urgell from c.1063 until 1065 as the wife of Count Ermengol III. Her brothers Sancho Ramírez and García Ramírez became king of Aragon and bishop of Pamplona, respectively. During her brother's reign she played an important role in consolidating the Kingdom of Aragon, which had been founded by her father in 1035.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\nAround 1063, when she was only about 18 years old, Sancha married the much older count of Urgell. She was his fourth wife and he had been count since 1038. He died after only a few years of marriage in 1065. As a twenty-year-old widow, Sancha remained for a while in Urgell, appearing in acts beside her stepson Count Ermengol IV. On 12 April 1065, she made a donation for the sake of her late husband's soul.\n\n\n== Convent ==\nWhen Sancha finally returned to Aragon she entered the convent Santa María of Santa Cruz de la Serós, the oldest house of nuns in Aragon, founded in 922. Her sister Urraca was already a nun there, having entered at their father's request in 1061. Her other sister, Theresa, later also entered the monastery, probably on her brother Sancho's orders because no suitable husband could be found for her. Sancha does not appear to have become a nun, but to have instead acted as administrator of the convent. She was a beneficiary of her brother's donations, and her estates formed almost an apanage (infantazgo) of the royal family. They would form the nucleus of the monastery's later territory.\nOn 27 October 1070 in the atrium of the abbey of Santa Cruz, before the abbess and the nuns, Sancha de Aibar, the mother of King Ramiro, gave to her granddaughter and namesake, Countess Sancha, the monastery of Santa Cecilia de Aibar with its appurtenances and revenues, the Villa Miranda in the Cinco Villas and the estate of San Pelayo de Atés. The elder Sancha had received the estate at Aibar with the monastery from Queen Jimena Fernández, the grandmother of Ramiro. From Ramiro her son she received Miranda and San Pelayo after he became king. After her gift to her granddaughter she entered the convent of Santa Cruz. The younger Sancha was to enjoy the profits of her acquisitions until her own death, when they would pass to Santa Cruz. This donation and its stipulations is evidence that Sancha, although quite young, had no intention of remarrying as of 1070.\nIn 1078, Sancha, acting on behalf of Santa Cruz, exchanged some land with the monastery of Leire. In 1079, she made a similar exchange of properties with San Juan de la Peña, this time accompanied by the abbess of Santa Cruz, Mindonia. She also administered the abbey of San Pedro de Siresa. In 1080, she witnessed the will of Count Sancho Galíndez.\n\n\n== Policy ==\nSancha had the confidence of her brother. She judged cases along with the king and queen, and confirmed royal diplomas. In 1082, during a dispute between her brothers, the king gave the administration of the diocese of Pamplona and its revenues to Sancha. She managed it until the election of a new bishop, Pedro de Roda, in 1083. In her administration of both the abbey of Santa Cruz and the diocese of Pamplona, Sancha worked to further the Gregorian reforms. She was possibly the most important ally Pope Gregory VII had in the Iberian peninsula at the time.\nSancha was present on 4 December 1094 when the church of San Juan de la Peña was consecrated and the body of her brother Sancho was interred. On 17 December 1096, she and her nephew King Peter I confirmed the donation made by Pedro de Roda, newly made bishop of Huesca, to the monastery of Saint-Pons-de-Thomières after the conquest of the city of Huesca. On 5 April 1097, she confirmed her nephew's donation of the cathedral of Huesca to the church.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources == The Cathedral of Santa María de Vitoria (Basque: \"Santa Maria katedrala\", Spanish: \"Catedral de Santa María de Vitoria\") is a Gothic-style, Roman Catholic cathedral located in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque country, Spain. It was declared \"Bien de Interés Cultural\" in 1931. Disney Cruise Line is a cruise line operation that is a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. The company was incorporated in 1996 as Magical Cruise Company Limited, through its first vessel Disney Magic, and is domiciled in London, England, with their operational headquarters located in Celebration, Florida. Disney Cruise Line operates five ships: Disney Magic, Disney Wonder, Disney Dream, Disney Fantasy, and Disney Wish. Three ships will join the fleet in 2024, 2025, and 2026. The next ones are announced to be named Disney Treasure, Disney Adventure, and Disney Destiny. Disney Cruise Line owns Castaway Cay, a private island in the Bahamas designed as an exclusive port of call for Disney's ships. A second private destination, Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point, a 700-acre property on the southern end of Eleuthera, Bahamas opened on June 6, 2024. Disney Cruise Line operates two Disney Cruise Line Terminals in Florida. The cruise line has experienced some growth over the past several years. In 2011, the company held a 1.95 percent market share and by 2015, Disney Cruise Lines had 2.8 percent of the worldwide cruise market by passenger and 2.4 percent by revenue. In 2018, Disney Cruise Lines declined to 2.3 percent of the worldwide cruise market by passenger and 2.2 percent by revenue. In 2021, the market share is 2.2 percent by passenger and 2.7 percent by revenue. For 2024, Disney Cruise Lines is forecast to capture 2.8 percent of the passenger market and 4.2 percent of total revenue.    Background  In 1985, Premier Cruise Line became Disney's licensed partner cruise line. This allowed Disney characters on their ships and combined cruise, hotel, and theme park packages. In 1993, Premier ended their relationship with Disney and signed a new one with Warner Brothers, utilizing the Looney Tunes characters. Premier continued to offer Disney Land and Sea packages while adding Universal Studios as an option. Thus, Disney approached both Carnival and Royal Caribbean cruise lines to replace Premier as an exclusive sea partner.    History  When Disney's negotiations with two major cruise lines, Carnival and Royal Caribbean, did not produce results, Disney had cruise ship designs drawn up by February 1994. Meanwhile, Walt Disney Travel Company started signing up other cruise lines to offer Disney hotels and resort packages. In May 1994, Disney announced that they intended to start cruise line operations in 1998. Arthur Rodney was selected to serve as the first president of the cruise line tentatively called Disney Vacation Cruises. In 1995, Disney Cruise Line commissioned Disney Magic and Disney Wonder from Fincantieri in Italy. The cruise line was incorporated as Devonson Cruise Company, Limited in February 1996, in the United Kingdom, and was renamed Magical Cruise Company Limited in October 1996. The cruise line cost as much as a theme park to start up. In 1996, Magical Cruise Company purchased Gorda Cay as the line's private island. The company spent $25 million over 18 months on the island and renamed it Castaway Cay. The Disney Magic's first cruise was originally scheduled for March 1998 but was postponed twice. The Disney Wonder was scheduled for December 1998. On July 30, 1998, with the first voyage of Magic, the Disney Cruise Line was operational. A 10-year contract was signed with Port Canaveral for its home terminal. With the August 1999, resignation of Rodney as cruise line president, the senior operating officer Matt Ouimet was named as his replacement in July. In 2002, the line added seven-day cruises and western Caribbean cruises. In May 2005, Disney Magic moved its port for the summer cruise season to the Port of Los Angeles. This was temporary for the company's 50th-anniversary celebration of Disneyland and as a test for California expansion. The transfer cruise sold out quicker than expected. Bookings from first-time Disney cruisers were up for these cruises by at least 60%. While Disney had wanted additional ships, shipbuilding costs had increased by at least 33% since it built its first two ships. The Disney Magic was transferred to the Mediterranean for an extended stay in 2007. In 2007, Disney announced the building of two new cruise ships. Disney Dream set sail in January 2011, followed closely by Disney Fantasy in 2012. Meyer Werft shipyard, based in Papenburg, Germany, built the new ships.    New Vacation Operation unit  In February 2009, Tom McAlpin left the Disney Cruise Line presidency and was replaced by Karl Holz as president of Disney Cruise Line and New Vacation Operations. In early 2009, Disney and Canaveral Port Authority extended their agreement to 2022 with expansion to the terminal to handle the new class of ships. San Caprasio is a church in Santa Cruz de la Serós, Jacetania, Spain, in First Romanesque style. The White Bay Cruise Terminal is a terminal for cruise ships on Sydney Harbour. The terminal is located at the eastern end of the White Bay wharves, on the northern shore of White Bay. It opened on 15 April 2013 as a replacement for Wharf 8 on Darling Harbour which closed to make way for the Barangaroo development. \nWhite Bay handles all domestic cruise operations.  The Overseas Passenger Terminal meanwhile handles all International cruise liners.\n\nThe terminal building was constructed within and amongst a twin-beam gantry structure originally constructed in the 1960s for gantry cranes for container use. In October 2013 it won the transport section at the World Architecture Festival. The Overseas Passenger Terminal remains as Sydney's primary terminal, with the White Bay Cruise Terminal only taking those vessels which can fit under the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nWhen the terminal is occupied, Captain Cook Cruises operate a ferry service to Barangaroo.\nA 2017 study into implementing shore power at the White Bay Cruise Terminal estimated the implementation cost to be $36 million causing the NSW State Government to rule out implementing it. On 21 March 2022 it was announced that approximately $60 million would be spent to enable shore power at the terminal from 2024. \nA free shuttle bus connects cruise passengers to the nearby Sydney CBD and Circular Quay.\n\n\n== References == The Church of Santa María de Palacio( Spanish:\" Iglesia de Santa María de Palacio\") is a church located in Logroño, Spain. It was declared\" Bien de Interés Cultural\" in 1943. Santa María de Santa Cruz de la Serós is a former Benedictine nunnery in Spain. It is located about ten miles from Jaca, in the village of Santa Cruz de la Serós, which is named after the nunnery. The church of San Caprasio, built between 1020 and 1030, a half century earlier than Santa María, stands nearby in the same village. == Royal connection ==\nIn the 11th century it functioned as a \"family monastery\" for the royal family of Aragon. Female members of the family ruled the monastery from within while family members outside the monastery patronised it.\nThe date of Santa María's foundation is unknown. It is first mentioned in a document of 1070. In that document, Sancha de Aibar, mother of King Ramiro I, grants some land to Ramiro I's daughter Sancha on the condition that she leave them to the nuns of Santa María on her death. Although there is no earlier reference to the nunnery, it appears to have been in existence for some times, since it had both an abbess, Menosa, and a church building at the time of Sancha's grant, since the document itself was drawn up \"in the atrium of Santa María, before the abbess Lady Menosa\". In her will of 1095, the younger Sancha specifies that her bequest should go to \"the workshop of the church for Santa María\". Besides Sancha, Ramiro I's other two daughters, Teresa, his eldest who never married, and Urraca, who may have been married to Count William Bertrand of Provence, both made donations to Santa María before entering it as nuns. In a document dated 15 March 1061, Ramiro I commends his daughter Urraca to the abbess and nuns of Santa María, but this document is probably a forgery. Urraca seems to have entered the nunnery towards 1070. \nRamiro I's daughter-in-law, Felicia, wife of King Sancho Ramírez, donated an evangelary to the nunnery. It is now lost, but either of two surviving silver-gilt plaques incorporating some Byzantine ivories is thought to have been its book cover. The covers, one of which bears Felicia's name, now reside in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Both may have at one time belonged to Santa María.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe nuns' church, which was at least under construction in the late 11th century, is one of the earliest buildings in Aragon in the Romanesque style. The plan of the small church, which is the only building of the complex that still stands, is that of a Latin cross. The exterior is ashlar masonry. The interior has sculpted capitals and intricate mouldings. The nave is barrel-vaulted with a semicircular apse. The south arm of the transept has a high tower with a dome on squinches. The bunched and massive look of the church probably stood out less when it was merely the central building among many, but today it stands alone. Many of the architectural elements have traces of polychrome: they were once painted in bright colours.\nThe tympanum has a carved chrismon and two lions reminiscent of the tympanum of the cathedral of Jaca, which was the original capital and royal city of Aragon. There is an unusual octagonal \"secret\" chamber above the crossing with a ribbed dome-shaped vault that can only be reached through a steep stairway buried in the thick south wall of the nave, which stairs can only be accessed through a small door set high in the wall. This room may have been the abbess's quarters or perhaps a chamber for the nuns to hide in in the event of danger. The corbel on the west wall of this room was carved by the same master who carved the sarcophagus of  Ramiro I's daughter Sancha.\nIn 1490, a large reredos centred around an alabaster sculpture of the Virgin Mary was added by the holy water font. Several capitals rescued from the now lost cloisters were relocated to the area by the font as well.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources == The Port of Newcastle is a major seaport in the city of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. It is the world's largest coal port.\nIt is made up of facilities located at Port Hunter - Yohaaba in the Hunter River estuary.  The port was the first commercial export port in Australia and is the world's busiest coal export port.  Annual exports of coal from Newcastle exceeded A$15 billion in 2012–13. Newcastle berthed more than 2,200 ships a year in 2012–13.\nThe port's harbourmaster is the Port Authority of New South Wales.  Cargo facilities are operated by Port Waratah Coal Services and Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group at Kooragang Island, as well as other operators at Mayfield, Carrington and Walsh Point.  There are plans to build a cruise terminal.\nIn April 2014 Premier Mike Baird and Treasurer Andrew Constance announced that a \"a consortium which comprises Hastings Funds Management and Chinese state-owned China Merchants\" had successfully bid $1.75 billion for a 98-year lease of the Port of Newcastle.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-colonial history ===\n\nThe Awabakal people were the inhabitants of Newcastle (Muloobinba) living around the harbour and foreshore prior to European contact. Discarded shells of shellfish harvested by local clans for thousands of years formed enormous middens which were burned by Europeans to produce lime for building purposes.

Newcastle upon Tyne, or simply Newcastle (  new-KASS-əl, RP:   NEW-kah-səl), is a city and metropolitan borough in Tyne and Wear, England. It is England's northernmost metropolitan borough, located on the River Tyne's northern bank opposite Gateshead to the south. It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England. Newcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as Monkchester before taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror's eldest son, Robert Curthose. It was one of the world's largest ship building and repair centres during the Industrial Revolution. Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, but governed as a county corporate after 1400. In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear. The local authority is Newcastle City Council, which is a constituent member of the North East Mayoral Combined Authority.    History     Roman  The first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius (\"Hadrian's bridge\"), a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. It was given the family name of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD. This rare honour suggests Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain. The population of Pons Aelius then is estimated at 2,000. Fragments of Hadrian's Wall are visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the \"Roman Wall\" can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort in Wallsend – the \"wall's end\" – and to the separate supply fort of Arbeia in South Shields, across the river from Hadrian's Wall. The extent of Hadrian's Wall was 73 miles (117 km), spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was built primarily for defence and to prevent the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, and probably not as a fighting line for a major invasion. However, it seems that the Vallum stopped just west of Newcastle, where its role as a secondary line of defence was performed by the River Tyne.    Anglo-Saxon and Norman  After the Roman departure from Britain, completed in 410, Newcastle became part of the powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, and was known throughout this period as Munucceaster (sometimes modernised as Monkchester). Conflicts with the Danes in 876 left the settlements along the River Tyne in ruins. After the conflicts with the Danes, and following the 1088 rebellion against the Normans, Monkchester was all but destroyed by Odo of Bayeux. Because of its strategic position, Robert Curthose, son of William the Conqueror, erected a wooden castle there in the year 1080. The town was henceforth known as Novum Castellum or New Castle. The wooden structure was replaced by a stone castle in 1087. The castle was rebuilt again in 1172 during the reign of Henry II. Much of the keep which can be seen in the city today dates from this period.    Middle Ages  Throughout the Middle Ages, Newcastle was England's northern fortress. In 1400 Newcastle was separated from Northumberland for administrative purposes and made a county of itself by Henry IV. Newcastle was given the title of the county of the town of Newcastle upon Tyne. The town had a new charter granted by Elizabeth I in 1589. A 25-foot-high (7.6 m) stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century, to defend it from invaders during the Border war against Scotland. The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town. Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century.    16th to 19th centuries   From 1530, a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from Tyneside to Newcastle Quayside, giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as the Hostmen. This monopoly, which lasted for a considerable time, helped Newcastle prosper and develop into a major town. The phrase taking coals to Newcastle was first recorded contextually in 1538. The phrase itself means a pointless pursuit. In the 18th century, the American entrepreneur Timothy Dexter, regarded as an eccentric, defied this idiom. The monastery of Santa María de Oseira( Galician:\" Mosteiro de Santa María de Oseira\"; Spanish:\" Monasterio de Santa María la Real de Oseira)\" is a Trappist monastery in Galicia, Spain. One of the first streams of Romanesque architecture in Europe from the 10th century and the beginning of 11th century is called First Romanesque or Lombard Romanesque. It took place in the region of Lombardy (at that time the term encompassing the whole of Northern Italy) and spread into Catalonia and into the south of France. Its principal decoration for the exterior, bands of ornamental blind arches are called Lombard bands. It was characterized by thick walls and lack of sculpture in facades, and with interiors profusely painted with frescoes. During the first quarter of the 11th century, much architectural activity by groups composed of Lombard teachers and stonemasons (Comacine Guild), who worked throughout much of Europe and Catalan territories and erected fairly uniform temples, some of which still exist today. For a considerable area this process of craft diffusion started in Lombardy and Lombardus became the word for mason at an early period. One might call the First Romanesque style the style of this Italian architectural reconquest. The large promoter and sponsor of this art in Catalonia was Oliva, monk and abbot of the monastery of Ripoll who, in 1032, ordered the extension of the body of this building with a façade with two towers, plus a transept which included seven apses, all decorated on the outside with the Lombardic ornamentation of blind arches and vertical strips. Catalan architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch suggested that what was formerly considered the late form of pre-Romanesque architecture in Catalonia bore features of Romanesque and thus classified it as First Romanesque (primer romànic). The First Romanesque churches of the Vall de Boí were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in November 2000. The geographical proximity of this Iberian region to the rest of Europe, resulted in depictions of the emerging Romanesque art being brought to Catalonia. While the art failed to take root in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula until the second third of the 11th century, there are numerous examples of its presence in Catalan counties before this time. Though this style may not be considered fully Romanesque, the area contained many of the defining characteristics of this artistic style. To avoid the term Pre-Romanesque, which is often used with a much broader meaning than is generally suited to refer to early Medieval and early Christian art, and in Spain may also refer to the Visigothic, Asturias, Mozarabic and Repoblación art forms, Puig i Cadafalch preferred to use the term \"First Romanesque\" or \"first Romanesque art\" to designate those Catalan anticipations of the Romanesque itself.

Jason Ankeny, music critic for AllMusic, said Alexander was a \"country-soul pioneer\" and that, though largely unknown, \"his music is the stuff of genius, a poignant and deeply intimate body of work on par with the best of his contemporaries. \" Alexander's songs were covered by such stars as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Gerry and the Pacemakers, Otis Redding, Tina Turner and Jerry Lee Lewis. Arthur Alexander (May 10, 1940 – June 9, 1993) was an American country-soul songwriter and singer. Jason Ankeny, music critic for AllMusic, said Alexander was a \"country-soul pioneer\" and that, though largely unknown, \"his music is the stuff of genius, a poignant and deeply intimate body of work on par with the best of his contemporaries.\" Alexander's songs were covered by such stars as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Gerry and the Pacemakers, Otis Redding, Tina Turner, Pearl Jam, and Jerry Lee Lewis.    Life  Alexander was born in Sheffield, Alabama, United States. Working with Spar Music in Florence, Alabama, Alexander recorded his first single, \"Sally Sue Brown\", under the name of June Alexander (short for Junior), which was released in 1960 on Jud Phillips' Judd Records. (Phillips is the brother of music pioneer Sam Phillips). A year later, Alexander cut \"You Better Move On\", at the fledgling FAME Studios, which at that point was located above the City Drug Store in Florence, Alabama. (The studio would shortly move to its more famous location in nearby Muscle Shoals, Alabama.) Released on Nashville's Dot Records, the song became a soul/R&B chart hit, and laid the foundation for the modern recording studio FAME. \"You Better Move On\" is perhaps Alexander's best-known song, covered by the Rolling Stones, the Hollies, George Jones & Johnny Paycheck, Gene Clark (from the Byrds) and Mink DeVille. \"Anna (Go to Him)\", a U.S. R&B Top Ten Hit, was covered by the Beatles, Roger McGuinn (from The Byrds) and Humble Pie. The Beatles did live recordings of \"Soldier of Love\" (also performed by Marshall Crenshaw and Pearl Jam), \"A Shot of Rhythm and Blues\", and \"Where Have You Been\" at the Star-Club in Hamburg in 1962. In 1962, Steve Alaimo was the first to record Alexander's \"Every Day I Have to Cry\", which reached No.46 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Dusty Springfield also recorded the song for her first UK solo EP, \"I Only Want to Be With You\", released in 1964. In the mid-1960s, Alexander switched to another label, Sound Stage 7, but failed to find commercial success. Although a 1972 album for Warner Brothers was promising, the singer's potential seemed to wither. He secured a pop hit with \"Every Day I Have to Cry Some\" on Buddah Records in 1975, but the success remained short-lived. The song was also covered by Ike and Tina Turner (produced by Phil Spector), the McCoys, Dusty Springfield, Joe Stampley, C.J. Chenier, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Gentrys and others. The follow-up single \"Sharing The Night Together\" (written by Muscle Shoals songwriters Ava Aldridge and Eddie Struzick) reached No. 92 on the R&B charts, but earned Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show a Top 10 hit in 1978; the Dr. Hook version was used in the 2012 Family Guy episode \"Mr. and Mrs. Stewie\". For many years, Alexander was out of the music business; he was a bus driver for much of this time. In 1990, he was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. He began to perform again in 1993 as renewed interest was shown in his back catalogue. His last album, Lonely Just Like Me, was his first in 21 years. He signed a new recording/publishing contract in May 1993 but suffered a fatal heart attack on June 9, 1993, in Nashville, three days after performing there with his new band. He is buried in Florence City Cemetery in Florence, Alabama.    Legacy  Alexander is the only songwriter whose songs have been covered on studio albums by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan (who recorded \"Sally Sue Brown\" on his 1988 LP Down in the Groove). In 1987, Paul McCartney claimed that \"If the Beatles wanted a sound, it was R&B. That's what we used to listen to and what we wanted to be like. Black, that was basically it.

Early life  Noah Lindsey Cyrus was born January 8, 2000, in Nashville, Tennessee, to producer and director Tish Cyrus and country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. Her parents had a loving but tumultuous marriage, each filing for divorce on several occasions, but restoring their relationship. Her siblings include Miley, Braison, Brandi, Trace, and Christopher Cyrus, who have also mostly become musicians and entertainers. Their paternal grandfather, Ron Cyrus, was a politician in Kentucky. Cyrus, like many child performers, attended Brighton Hall School in Burbank, California.    Career     Acting  At the age of 2, Cyrus began her acting career, playing Gracie Hebert on the sixth episode of her father's TV show Doc. She was a background dancer in the 2009 film Hannah Montana: The Movie (with her real-life older sister), and played small roles in six episodes of the Disney Channel original series Hannah Montana. She appeared in the straight-to-DVD film Mostly Ghostly: Who Let the Ghosts Out? (2008), where she was spotted as a Trick or Treater. In 2009, her first film role was in the English version of the Japanese anime feature film Ponyo, in which she voiced the titular character. She sang the English version of the theme song to that film, performing alongside her co-star Frankie Jonas. Between 2009 and 2010, Cyrus ran a webshow with her childhood best friend, former child actress Emily Grace Reaves, called The Noie and Ems Show. In 2021, she guest-starred in the seventh episode of the horror anthology series American Horror Stories, playing a character named Connie.    Music     2016–2018: Music beginnings and Good Cry   On November 15, 2016, it was announced that Cyrus had signed a record deal with Barry Weiss' record label named Records, and later signed a management deal with Maverick under Adam Leber. She released her debut single \"Make Me (Cry)\" featuring English singer Labrinth that same day. In December 2016, she released an acoustic performance of \"Almost Famous\". She also provided vocals on the song \"Chasing Colors\" performed by Marshmello and Ookay, which was released in February 2017. On April 14, 2017, she released another single, called \"Stay Together\", followed by the single \"I'm Stuck\", released on May 25, 2017. On September 21, 2017, she released another single \"Again\" featuring XXXTentacion. From September 19, 2017, to November 1, 2017, she opened for Katy Perry on the Witness: The Tour. In November 2017, Cyrus made an appearance at Emo Nite in Los Angeles for a surprise DJ set which included some of her and her half-brother Trace Cyrus' music. \"My Way\", a collaboration with electronic group One Bit, was released on November 24, 2017.

On July 9, 2018, Cyrus announced her first headlining tour, The Good Cry Tour. \"Live or Die\", a collaboration with her now ex-boyfriend Lil Xan, was released on August 20, 2018. Norwegian DJ Matoma featured Cyrus on \"Slow\" in 2017, which was featured on his second album One in a Million, released on August 24, 2018. \"I Guess I'll Have to Cry, Cry, Cry\" is a song written and performed by James Brown. Released as a single in 1968, it charted #15 R&B and #55 Pop.\nThis song is noted as the last single by Brown to give label credit to his vocal group, The Famous Flames. Although they technically stopped singing on Brown's singles in 1964, The Flames, Bobby Byrd, Bobby Bennett, and Lloyd Stallworth, were still together, touring as a live performance group with Brown, and Byrd continued to sing on record with him. In 1968, however, The Flames all left Brown, citing monetary differences, and although Byrd returned 18 months later, the other members never returned. All of Brown's King Records singles from this point on, starting with Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud, gave him sole label credit.\nThe Wailers recorded a reggae version of the song under the title \"My Cup\" on their 1970 album Soul Rebels.\n\n\n== References == Alonso Mudarra( c. 1510 – April 1, 1580) was a Spanish composer of the Renaissance, and also played the vihuela, a guitar- shaped string instrument.

Flamboyant, charismatic, and energetic, Arthur used his prominent American and European financial connections to fund numerous business ventures, most of which were overly ambitious and ultimately failed.  A proponent of economic advancement in what became known as the New South, Arthur played a primary role in the development of the Cumberland Gap area, and in the course of his endeavors established the cities of Middlesboro, Kentucky and Harrogate, Tennessee.  The community of Arthur, Tennessee, is named for him. After spending his early life migrating back and forth between Scotland, Canada, and Scandinavia, Arthur moved to Boston in 1879, and accepted a position as the general manager of the Scottish-Carolina Timber and Land Company's American operations.  In the early 1880s, Arthur identified a rich stand of timber in the upper Blue Ridge Mountains along the Tennessee-North Carolina border, and devised a boom system to extract the timber from the difficult mountain terrain.   Later in the same decade, Arthur identified the abundant iron ore deposits in the Cumberland Gap region, and established a multimillion-dollar iron production operation in hopes of making Middlesboro the \"Pittsburgh of the South.\" While he never experienced great financial success, Arthur's endeavors were a harbinger of the great logging and mining operations that became major economic forces in Southern Appalachia in the early 20th century.    Biography     Early life  Alexander Arthur was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the eldest son of Alexander and Catherine Allen Arthur.  While Alexander was still a child, the Arthurs moved to Montreal, Canada, although Arthur returned to Glasgow within a few years to attend school.  In 1867, Arthur joined the 167th Highlander Regiment, and during the same period married his first wife, Mary Forrest.  Arthur moved several times throughout the following decade, living in Norway and Sweden before immigrating to the U.S. city of Boston in 1879.  After the death of his first wife, Arthur married Boston socialite Nellie Goodwin, who introduced him to numerous New England financial connections.    Scottish-Carolina Timber and Land Company  In the early 1880s, Arthur, working in Knoxville, Tennessee as an agent for the Glasgow-based Scottish-Carolina Timber and Land Company, concocted a plan to harvest the dense, virgin forests of the Pigeon River Valley on the northern fringe of the Great Smoky Mountains east of Knoxville.  While these mountains contained one of the richest timber stands in the eastern United States, their general remoteness and rugged terrain had left them mostly untouched by loggers for much of the 19th century.  Arthur's plan called for harvested logs to be floated down the Pigeon River in a controlled fashion using a series of logging booms. Arthur chose the small community of Newport, near where the Pigeon River exits the high mountains and enters the upper Tennessee Valley, as a base for his logging operations.  Company employees and specialists from as far away as South Africa arrived to begin building the booms, and by 1884 the company had begun accumulating logs in its boom reservoirs.  Historian Wilma Dykeman described Arthur during this period as the \"epitome of elegance,\" moving about in a Prince Albert coat and \"lord mayor air.\"  Dykeman said of Arthur:  ... he rode, lord and master, on a shiny black stump-tailed horse over his domain, never settling the bulk of his weight into the saddle, but always standing in the stirrups as if personally overseeing in the wilderness the birth of empire.  Arthur built a large house in Newport— known as \"The Mansion\"— and made plans to redesign the rough frontier village as an ideal community, complete with parks, clubhouses, hotels, a new town hall, and a college.  However, Arthur underestimated the volatility of Appalachian Mountain streams, which swell to many times their size after heavy rains.  In Spring 1886, a cloudburst dumped torrential rains into the upper Pigeon Valley, and the river flooded, threatening the boom that held the company's stock of logs.  Arthur spent 12 hours in the pouring rain directing efforts to save the boom, but it eventually collapsed, and the logs scattered for miles downstream.  An investigation by Scottish Timber blamed Arthur for the loss, determining that he should have foreseen such a flood, and the entire operation folded shortly afterward.    American Association, Ltd.  In 1885, Arthur travelled to Cumberland Gap (at the junction of Tennessee, Virginia, and Kentucky) to report on the feasibility of building a railroad in the area, and was impressed by the abundant iron ore and coal deposits in the Yellow Creek Valley, on the Kentucky side of the Gap. Alexander Arthur Van Halen (Dutch pronunciation: [aːlɛkˈsɑndər fɑn ˈɦaːlə(n)]; born May 8, 1953) is an American retired musician who was the drummer and a co-founder of the rock band Van Halen, which was formed in 1972 by Van Halen and his younger brother Eddie under the name \"Mammoth\" before adding Michael Anthony and David Lee Roth in 1974 and changing their name to Van Halen. Warner Bros. signed the band in 1977, and the band's debut album was released a year later. Prior to their disbandment in 2020, following Eddie's death, Van Halen released 12 studio albums, and the brothers were the only two constant members of the band.    Early life  Van Halen was born in Amsterdam. The family name in Dutch is van Halen (with lower-case 'v') and is pronounced in Dutch as [vɑn ˈɦaːlə(n)]. His Dutch father, Jan van Halen (1920–1986), was an accomplished jazz saxophonist and clarinetist. His mother, Eugenia van Beers (1914–2005), was an Indo (Eurasian) from Rangkasbitung, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Alex spent his early years in Nijmegen in the east of the Netherlands. The family moved to Pasadena, California, in 1962. Alex and his brother Eddie became naturalized U.S. citizens. Both brothers were trained as classical pianists during childhood. Although Alex is known as a professional drummer, he began his musical aspirations as a guitarist, with his brother Eddie taking up drums. While Eddie was delivering newspapers to pay for his drum kit, Alex would practice playing on them. After spending some time playing Eddie's drum kit, Alex became more skilled than Eddie was as a drummer. After Eddie heard Alex's mastery of The Surfaris drum solo in the song \"Wipe Out\", he decided to learn to play the electric guitar. Alex was influenced by Budgie drummer Ray Phillips. Alex, Eddie and three other boys formed their first band when they were in the fourth grade, calling themselves \"The Broken Combs\"; they performed at lunchtime at Hamilton Elementary School in Pasadena. In 1971, Van Halen graduated from Pasadena High School. He then took classes in music theory, scoring, composition and arranging at Pasadena City College for a short while. While there, Alex met Michael Anthony and David Lee Roth. They formed the band Mammoth, and Alex, along with the others, left Pasadena City College.    Career  Alex and Eddie Van Halen had several early bands before the formation of Van Halen. In addition to The Broken Combs, there were The Space Brothers, The Trojan Rubber Company, and Mammoth. In 1972, the brothers formed Mammoth with Mark Stone on bass and Eddie on lead vocals. The band rented David Lee Roth's PA system for their shows. Soon after, Eddie became tired of singing lead, and asked Roth to join the band. Later, in 1974, since the name Mammoth was already taken by another band, the name was changed to Van Halen, and Stone was replaced by Michael Anthony. Roth has claimed that it was his idea to rename the band Van Halen, and that he actually named it after Alex. In addition to his musical duties at this time, Alex handled managerial duties, such as booking gigs, and the like for the band. Their 1978 self-titled debut album Van Halen was released to much fanfare, influencing many musicians in hard rock. Van Halen had released eleven more studio albums since then, and officially disbanded a month after Eddie's death on October 6, 2020. Although the term \"brown sound\" is generally associated with Eddie's guitar, it was actually coined by Alex to refer to the sound of his snare drum. Alex never recorded any music without his brother being involved, with Michael Anthony saying that \"the only person that he plays with is Ed.\" The only recording Alex has made outside of the band is playing keyboards on the Eddie Van Halen instrumental \"Respect the Wind\", done for the Twister soundtrack and earning the Van Halen brothers a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In June of 2024, Alex auctioned off all of his drum gear he had in storage for decades. This led people to believe that he will no longer be involved in music without his brother Edward on stage with him.  Alex is set to release a book called Brothers on October 22, 2024.    Equipment   Van Halen endorses Ludwig drums, pedals and hardware, Paiste cymbals, Remo drumheads and Regal Tip drumsticks. Edward Arthur Alexander Shackleton, Baron Shackleton,  (15 July 1911 – 22 September 1994) was a British geographer, Royal Air Force officer and Labour Party politician.    Early life and career  Born in Wandsworth, London, Shackleton was the younger son of Emily Mary and Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Antarctic explorer. Edward Shackleton was educated at Radley College, an independent boarding school for boys in Oxfordshire, followed by Magdalen College, Oxford. Shackleton arranged the 1932 Oxford University Exploration Club expedition to Sarawak in Borneo organised by Tom Harrisson. During this trip, he made the first ascent of Mount Mulu. In 1934 Shackleton organised the Oxford University Ellesmere Land Expedition and chose Gordon Noel Humphreys to lead it. Shackleton accompanied the party as assistant surveyor to Humphreys. The expedition was eventually responsible for naming Mount Oxford (after the University of Oxford) and the British Empire Range.  On leaving the university, he worked as a Talks Producer for the BBC in Northern Ireland – an experience that turned him away from the Conservatives towards Labour.    Royal Air Force service  Shackleton served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. On 29 July 1940, he was commissioned into the Administrative and Special Duties Branch, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, as a pilot officer on probation. On 1 March 1941, he was promoted and granted the war substantive rank of flying officer. Following the probationary period, his commission was confirmed on 29 July 1941. He was promoted to flight lieutenant (temporary) on 1 September 1942, and made a war substantive flight lieutenant on 15 February 1944. He was an acting squadron leader by June 1944, and an acting wing commander by June 1945. In 1944, Shackleton was mentioned in despatches. In the 1945 King's Birthday Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). Shackleton relinquished his commission on 15 July 1956 and was granted permission to retain the rank of wing commander.    Political life  Shackleton stood unsuccessfully for Labour at Epsom in the 1945 general election and in the 1945 Bournemouth by-election. In 1946, he was elected for Labour as Member of Parliament for Preston in a by-election.  In 1949 he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Minister of Supply, George Strauss. A boundary change divided Preston into two seats, and in 1950 Shackleton was elected as MP for Preston South on a much-reduced majority.  The following year, he was promoted to be PPS to Lord President of the Council and Foreign Secretary Herbert Morrison, one of the heavyweight political figures in the post-war government.  He was re-elected in 1951. At the 1955 election, he was defeated. Hugh Gaitskell recommended Shackleton to the Prime Minister, and on 11 August 1958 he was created a life peer by letters patent as Baron Shackleton, of Burley in the County of Southampton. Shackleton delivered his maiden speech in the House of Lords on 11 November 1958, in a debate on a Wages Councils bill, one he thoroughly approved of and welcomed, to increase understanding between unions and management. In Harold Wilson's government, he served as Minister of Defence for the RAF 1964–67.  He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1966 and made Deputy Leader of the House of Lords a year later.  As Minister without Portfolio, 1967–1968, and Paymaster General in 1968, he had a seat on the cabinet.  During the Aden Emergency he was sent on a Special Mission as British Resident to help with the British withdrawal. In April 1968, after the budget, Wilson made Shackleton Leader of the House of Lords, succeeding the Earl of Longford. Shackleton was active in Wilson's proposals for House of Lords reform, designed to reduce the Lords delaying powers from two years to just six months, and he liaised between committees and sub-committees, but in April 1969 Wilson dropped the bill to \"concentrate on priorities.\"  Sitting on the committee for Civil Service Reform, Shackleton successfully widened access to entry for scientists.

The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as trade schools and colleges. Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education beyond secondary education is known as further education in the United Kingdom, or included under the category of continuing education in the United States. Tertiary education generally culminates in the receipt of certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees. Higher education represents levels 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the 2011 version of the International Standard Classification of Education structure. Tertiary education at a nondegree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. UNESCO stated that tertiary education focuses on learning endeavors in specialized fields. It includes academic and higher vocational education.  The World Bank's 2019 World Development Report on the future of work argues that given the future of work and the increasing role of technology in value chains, tertiary education becomes even more relevant for workers to compete in the labor market.    Definition   Higher education, also called post-secondary education, third-level or tertiary education, is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. This consists of universities, colleges and polytechnics that offer formal degrees beyond high school or secondary school education. The International Standard Classification of Education in 1997 initially classified all tertiary education together in the 1997 version of its schema. They were referred to as level 5 and doctoral studies at level 6. In 2011, this was refined and expanded in the 2011 version of the structure. Higher education at undergraduate level, masters and doctoral level became levels 6, 7, and 8. Nondegree level tertiary education, sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education was reordered as level 4, with level 5 for some higher courses. In the days when few pupils progressed beyond primary education or basic education, the term \"higher education\" was often used to refer to secondary education, which can create some confusion. This is the origin of the term high school for various schools for children between the ages of 14 and 18 (United States) or 11 and 18 (United Kingdom and Australia).    Global progress   Globally, the gross enrollment ratio in tertiary education increased from 19% in 2000 to 38% in 2017, with the female enrollment ratio exceeding the male ratio by 4 percentage points. The tertiary gross enrollment ratio ranges from 9% in low-income countries to 77% in high-income countries, where, after rapid growth in the 2000s, reached a plateau in the 2010s. Between now and 2030, the biggest increase in tertiary enrollment ratios is expected in middle-income countries, where it will reach 52%. Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) commits countries to providing lifelong learning opportunities for all, including tertiary education. This commitment is monitored through the global indicator for target 4.3 in the sustainable development goal 4 (SDG 4), which measures the participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non-formal education and training in the previous 12 months, whether for work or non-work purposes.    The right of access to higher education  The right of access to higher education is mentioned in a number of international human rights instruments. The UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 declares, in Article 13, that \"higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education\". In Europe, Article 2 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, adopted in 1950, obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the right to education.    Criticism  In 1994, the UNESCO Salamanca Statement called on the international community to endorse the approach of inclusive education, including at the tertiary level. Since this time the world has witnessed the global massification of tertiary education, yet this explosion of facilities and enrollment has largely entrenched and exacerbated the exclusion of people with disabilities. This is particularly the case in low- and middle-income contexts, where university completion rates for students with disabilities are much lower compared to completion rates of students without disabilities. Some tertiary schools have been criticized as having permitted or actively encouraged grade inflation. In addition, certain scholars contend that the supply of graduates in some fields of study is exceeding the demand for their skills, aggravating graduate unemployment, underemployment and credentialism.    Influence on views  Graduates of tertiary education are likely to have different worldviews and moral values than non-graduates. Research indicates that graduates are more likely to have libertarian principles with less adherence to social hierarchies.

The club competes as a member club of Major League Soccer (MLS) in the Western Conference. Founded in 2004, the club began play in 2005 as an expansion team of the league. The club plays its home games at America First Field (formerly known as Rio Tinto Stadium), a soccer-specific stadium located in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy, Utah, which they shared with their sister team, Utah Royals FC. Before moving to America First Field, RSL previously played home games at Rice-Eccles Stadium, located on the campus of the University of Utah, from 2005 to 2007. The team is currently led by head coach Pablo Mastroeni. In domestic soccer, Real Salt Lake won the 2009 MLS Cup, and they finished as runners-up in the Supporters Shield in 2010 and the 2013 editions of both the U.S. Open Cup and MLS Cup. The club additionally finished runners-up in the 2010-11 CONCACAF Champions League, becoming the first American club to do so during the tournament's group stage format. Their fully owned USL affiliate, Real Monarchs, won the USL Championship, the second division in American soccer, in 2019.    Name  The Spanish title Real (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal]), meaning \"royal\" in English, has been used since the early 20th century by Spanish soccer clubs who have received royal patronage from a reigning monarch — most notably Madrid, Zaragoza, Betis and Sociedad. In choosing the name Real for the Salt Lake-based team, initial owner Dave Checketts intended to create a brand name that would become well-known for its simplicity, followed the European-style naming conventions of the league, and would potentially foster a partnership with Real Madrid — admired both because of their successful soccer history and close association with basketball (similar to Checketts' own history with Utah's NBA team). Local reaction to the new team's name was initially met with mixed feelings, with the name being accused of contrivance. Other suggested team names, such as \"Highlanders\", \"Latter Day Saint FC\", \"Salt Lake SC\", or \"Union SLC\", were initially preferred for the club by locals. However, by at least 2014, reaction to the name had drastically improved, with the team establishing an identity representative of the Salt Lake community.    History     Early years (2005–2006)   Real Salt Lake became the twelfth MLS franchise when Major League Soccer awarded an expansion franchise on July 14, 2004, to SCP Worldwide, headed by Dave Checketts. Jason Kreis became the first player in RSL history, coming in a trade from the Dallas Burn. Other notable players who played in RSL's early years included veterans Clint Mathis, Eddie Pope and Jeff Cunningham. RSL's first season was 2005 under head coach John Ellinger. RSL began play on April 2, 2005, against New York MetroStars at Giants Stadium, which ended in a scoreless tie. The following week, Jason Kreis scored the first goal in franchise history in a 3–1 loss to LA Galaxy at the Home Depot Center. RSL played its first-ever home match on April 16, 2005, before 25,287 fans at Rice-Eccles Stadium; Brian Dunseth scored a header in the 81st minute to deliver a 1–0 victory over the Colorado Rapids. The season was mostly a disappointment, however, with the team setting a league record by posting a 557-minute scoreless streak (later broken by Toronto FC). They were also on a 10-game losing streak before managing a 2–2 draw on the road against San Jose Earthquakes. The first season finished with a record of 5–22–5. In 2006, Real Salt Lake's second season, the team recorded five losses and one tie in the first six matches of the season. RSL had gone 18 consecutive matches without a victory—the longest winless streak in MLS history. Jeff Cunningham, who came to Salt Lake from Colorado, provided most of Real's highlights during an otherwise poor 2006 season. The team failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing with a 10–13–9 record.    Turnaround and new stadium (2007–2008)  Real Salt Lake boasted a formidable attack with Cunningham and Kreis up front, joined by recently signed Panamanian international Luis Tejada. They were supported by veteran talent in the midfield and defense, such as Chris Klein, Carey Talley, and newly arrived goalkeeper Nick Rimando. Their first game of the 2007 MLS season was a 2–2 draw for FC Dallas on Real's home turf. Ghilamara Model Higher Secondary School is a Higher Secondary School situated in Ghilamara Lakhimpur Assam.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Are director of film The Monster Squad and director of film The Cup (2011 film) from the same country?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nNight of the Creeps is a 1986 American science fiction horror comedy film written and directed by Fred Dekker in his feature directorial debut, starring Jason Lively, Jill Whitlow, and Tom Atkins. The film is an earnest attempt at a B movie and an homage to the genre. While the main plot of the film is related to zombies, the film also mixes in takes on slashers and alien invasion films. Night of the Creeps did not perform well at the box office, but it developed a cult following. In the film, a college student and his best friend steal a cadaver from a cryogenics lab, as part of an initiation rite in a local fraternity. The \"corpse\" is an undead body from the late 1950s, and is under the control of an extraterrestrial organism. Soon, several other people are infected with these alien slugs.    Plot  In 1959, on board a spacecraft, two aliens race to keep an experiment from being released by a third member of the crew. The seemingly possessed third alien shoots the canister into space where it crashes to Earth. Nearby, a college man takes his date to a parking spot when they see a falling star and investigate. It lands in the path of an escaped criminally insane mental patient. As his date is attacked by the axe-wielding maniac, the boy finds the canister, from which a small slug-like thing jumps out and into his mouth. Twenty-seven years later in 1986, Chris Romero pines over a love lost, supported by his disabled friend J.C. Hooper. During pledge week at Corman University, Chris spots a girl, Cynthia Cronenberg, and falls instantly in love. To get her attention, he decides to join a fraternity. Cynthia's boyfriend, who heads the Beta Epsilon fraternity, tasks them with stealing a cadaver from the university medical center and depositing it on the steps of a rival fraternity house. Chris and J.C. find a frozen corpse in a secret room, but when it grabs them, they flee. The thawed corpse then kills a medical student working at the lab. Detective Ray Cameron, a haunted cop, is called in to the cryogenics lab break-in, where he discovers one of the bodies – the boy who discovered the alien experiment in 1959 – is now missing, set free by Chris and J.C. The corpse makes its way back to the sorority house where he picked up his date twenty-seven years ago. There, his head splits open and releases more of the slugs. Called to the scene, Cameron finds the body, interpreting the condition of the head as the result of an axe wound in the face. The next day, the fraternity brothers confront Chris and J.C., who they believe to be responsible for the previous night's incident. They are then taken in for questioning by the police. Based on the testimony of a janitor who witnessed them running out of the university medical center, \"screaming like banshees,\" they confess to breaking in but deny moving the corpse. That night, the dead medical student rises from his slab and runs into the janitor. Cynthia attempts to convince Chris and J.C. that the attacks are zombie-related, but they are skeptical. When J.C. sees Cynthia leaning on Chris' shoulder, J.C. leaves the two alone and is attacked by the slugs that emerge from the possessed janitor. After Chris walks Cynthia back to the sorority house, he runs into Cameron, who has overheard their conversation. At his house, Cameron explains to Chris that the escaped lunatic's 1959 victim was his ex-girlfriend, and that he secretly hunted down and killed the axe-murderer in revenge. After Cameron reveals that he buried the body under what is now the sorority house, he gets a call that the same axe-wielding lunatic has killed the house mother. Cameron blows off the corpse's head with his shotgun, which releases more slugs. The next night, while everyone prepares for a formal dance, Chris finds a recorded message that J.C. posthumously left for him. J.C. says that the slugs have incubated in his brain, but he has discovered that they are susceptible to heat. He confesses his love to Chris, and wishes him luck with Cynthia. Chris recruits Cameron, who was in the midst of a suicide attempt, and they retrieve a flamethrower from the police armory. They arrive at the sorority house just as Cynthia breaks up with Brad, who has become possessed. After killing him, the Beta fraternity brothers show up, despite having been killed in a bus crash. Cynthia and Chris team up to destroy the outside zombies while Cameron clears the house. After they stop the horde, Chris spots more slugs racing toward the basement; Cynthia explains that a member of the sorority had received specimen brains for biology class.

It is the sequel to the 1990 film RoboCop 2 and the third and final entry in the original RoboCop franchise. It stars Robert Burke, Nancy Allen and Rip Torn. Set in the near future in a dystopian metropolitan Detroit, the plot centers on RoboCop (Burke) as he vows to avenge the death of his partner Anne Lewis (Allen) and save Detroit from falling into chaos, while evil conglomerate OCP, run by its CEO (Torn), advances its program to demolish the city and build a new \"Delta City\" over the former homes of the residents. It was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia. Most of the set and background buildings were slated for demolition to make way for facilities in the 1996 Summer Olympics. RoboCop 3 is the first film to use digital morphing in more than one scene. The film was a critical and commercial failure in the US, grossing $47 million worldwide against its $22 million budget, making it the least profitable film of the RoboCop franchise. Two television series, RoboCop and RoboCop: Prime Directives, were released in 1994 and 2001 respectively, and the film series was rebooted with the 2014 remake RoboCop. A video game midquel, RoboCop: Rogue City (set between RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3), with Peter Weller reprising his role, was released in 2023.    Plot  In a dystopian future, the conglomerate Omni Consumer Products (OCP) have succeeded in their plan from prior films and have acquired the city of Detroit via bankruptcy, but are now struggling with their plans to create the new Delta City. The Delta City dream of the now-deceased OCP CEO lives on with the help of the Japanese Kanemitsu Corporation, which has bought a controlling stake in OCP and is trying to finance the plan with OCP having a new CEO. Kanemitsu, CEO of the Kanemitsu Corporation, proceeds with the plans to remove the current citizens to create Delta City, but is doubtful about the competence of his new partners. Due to passive resistance by the DPD toward mass eviction, OCP creates a heavily armed private security force called the Urban Rehabilitators, nicknamed \"Rehabs\", under the command of Paul McDaggett, to forcibly relocate the evicted citizens such as the residents of the now condemned Cadillac Heights. Nikko Halloran, a young resident of Cadillac Heights skilled with computers, loses her parents in the relocation process. RoboCop and his partner Anne Lewis try to defend civilians from the Rehabs one night, but McDaggett mortally wounds Lewis. Unable to fight back because of his \"Fourth Directive\" programming, RoboCop is saved by members of a resistance movement composed of Nikko and residents from Cadillac Heights and he joins them. Because he was severely damaged during the shoot-out, RoboCop's systems efficiency plummets and he asks the resistance to summon Dr. Lazarus, one of the scientists who created him. Upon arrival, she treats him, deleting the Fourth Directive in the process. During an earlier raid on an armory, the resistance acquired a jet-pack prototype, originally intended for RoboCop's use, which Lazarus modifies and upgrades to hold RoboCop. After recovering from his injuries, RoboCop conducts a one-man campaign against the Rehabs and OCP. He finds McDaggett and attempts to subdue him. However, McDaggett successfully escapes and obtains information from disgruntled resistance member Coontz about the location of the resistance fighters' base. Kanemitsu has developed his own ninja androids called \"Otomo\" and sends one to assist McDaggett against the resistance. The Rehabs attack and most of the resistance members are either killed or imprisoned. When RoboCop returns to the rebel base to find it abandoned, an Otomo unit arrives and attacks him. RoboCop experiences another power drain and both his left arm and auto gun are destroyed, but destroys his opponent with his arm-mounted gun. Nikko infiltrates the OCP building and assists a captured Lazarus in broadcasting an improvised video, revealing OCP as responsible for the city's high crime rates and incriminating them for removing and killing the Cadillac Heights residents. The broadcast causes OCP's stock to plunge, financially ruining the company. Meanwhile, McDaggett decides to execute an all-out strike against Cadillac Heights with the help of the Detroit police, but the police officers, enraged at the company's callous ways, instead defect to the resistance, escalating the rebellion against OCP into a full-scale war. As a result, McDaggett turns to hiring street gangs and hooligans to assist with his plans. Lonesome Dove is a 1989 American epic Western adventure television miniseries directed by Simon Wincer. It is a four-part adaptation of the 1985 novel of the same name by Larry McMurtry and is the first installment in the Lonesome Dove series. The novel was based upon a screenplay by Peter Bogdanovich and McMurtry. The miniseries stars an ensemble cast headed by Robert Duvall as Augustus McCrae and Tommy Lee Jones as Woodrow Call. The series was originally broadcast by CBS from February 5 to 8, 1989, drawing a huge viewing audience, earning numerous awards, and reviving both the television Western and the miniseries. An estimated 26 million homes tuned in to watch Lonesome Dove, unusually high numbers at that time for both a Western and a miniseries. By the show's end, it had earned huge ratings and virtually revamped the entire 1989–1990 television season. A favorite with audiences, as well as critics, Lonesome Dove garnered many honors and awards. At the 1989 Emmy Awards, the miniseries had 18 nominations and seven wins, including one for director Simon Wincer. Lonesome Dove also won two Golden Globes, for Best Miniseries and Best Actor in a Miniseries (Robert Duvall).    Plot  In the late 1870s, Captain Augustus \"Gus\" McCrae and Captain Woodrow F. Call, two famous former Texas Rangers, run a livery in the small, dusty Texas border town of Lonesome Dove along the Rio Grande. Gus is an upbeat womanizer and twice a widower, and Call is a strict, stoic workaholic. Working with them are Joshua Deets, a black tracker and scout from their Ranger days, Pea Eye Parker, another former Ranger who works hard but isn't very bright, and Bolívar, a retired Mexican bandit who is their cook. Also living with them is Newt Dobbs, a 17-year-old whose mother was a prostitute named Maggie and whose father may be any man on the ranch, save for Gus who secretly knows who Newt's true father is.    Part I: Leaving  Former Texas Ranger and comrade of Gus and Call's, Jake Spoon, shows up after an absence of more than a decade. He reveals that he is a fugitive after having accidentally shot the dentist and mayor of Fort Smith, Arkansas, in a bar-room gunfight. The dentist/mayor's brother happens to be the sheriff, July Johnson. Reunited with Gus and Call, Jake's glowing description of Montana inspires Call to gather a herd of cattle and drive them there, attracted by the notion of settling pristine country. Gus is less enthusiastic, pointing out that they are getting old and that they are Rangers and traders, not cowboys. But he changes his mind when he realizes Lonesome Dove has little left to offer him by way of excitement, now that much of the land has been \"civilized\". At the continued insistence of the dentist's widow, Sheriff Johnson sets off in pursuit of Spoon, accompanied by his young stepson Joe who travels at the request of Joe's mother and Sheriff Johnson's wife Elmira.  Once her son and husband have left for Texas, Elmira leaves Fort Smith for Ogallala, Nebraska, to meet up with her first husband and Joe's father, Dee Boot. Sailing up the Arkansas River on a whiskey boat, she falls in with a pair of buffalo hunters. Meanwhile, the men of Lonesome Dove make preparations for their adventure north, including stealing 2,500 horses and cattle from across the Rio Grande in Mexico, befriending two lost Irish immigrants, Allan and Sean O'Brien, and being joined by nearly all of the male citizens of the town. Before leaving, Gus returns to fetch his livery sign and say farewell to his pigs, who end up following him anyway. Back in Fort Smith, Peach (widowed from Jake's shooting) insists that Roscoe Brown, July's timid deputy, must find July to inform him that his wife has run off and is pregnant. Jake decides not to travel with the herd, mainly because he promises to take the town's only prostitute, Lorena \"Lorie\" Wood, to San Francisco via Denver. Some time later the group survives a huge dust storm, but Sean, one of the Irishmen, is attacked by water moccasins while crossing the Nueces River.    Part II: On the Trail  The young Irishman soon succumbs to his numerous snakebites, dies, and is buried. While travelling through a forest in east Texas, Roscoe encounters Janey, a young girl fleeing from an old abusive \"owner\". As they travel together they are robbed, when luckily Sheriff Johnson happens to catch up with them. Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.

The film details a struggle between a Los Angeles district attorney (Washington) and a vengeful criminal (Lithgow) whom he arrested when he was a cop.    Plot  In 1983, rookie Los Angeles police officer and law student Nick Styles meets Alice, and drifts away from childhood friend Odessa, who has become a drug dealer in South Central Los Angeles. Styles and his partner Larry Doyle patrol a carnival, where they encounter hitman Earl Talbot Blake and his accomplice Kim. Styles is forced into an armed standoff when Blake takes a hostage after killing several drug dealers. After stripping his equipment and uniform off, Styles uses a gun hidden in his athletic supporter, shooting Blake in the knee and subduing him. The incident is caught on camera by an amateur videographer and televised, making Styles a hero. He and Doyle are promoted to Detective, while Blake and Kim are sent to prison. Eight years later, Styles has become an Assistant District Attorney and is married to Alice with two daughters. Behind bars, Blake allies himself with the Aryan Brotherhood to plot an escape and take revenge against Styles. Kim is paroled and assists in Blake's escape. Blake and the AB members stage a violent and deadly prison escape during a parole hearing, which only Blake and the AB leader survive. Afterwards, Blake murders the AB gang leader and burns his corpse; however, while in prison, he had swapped their dental records, in order to fake his own death and ensure authorities would believe that Blake had died in the fire. Styles finds Odessa, now a major drug dealer in the neighborhood, and pleads with him to cease dealing to children. Blake and Kim kill city councilman Farris, a colleague of Styles, dressing his body in drag, planting child pornography in his briefcase and staging his death to look like a suicide, framing Styles for embezzling city funds. Blake and Kim abduct Styles outside his home and hold him hostage in an empty swimming pool for several days. Blake engages Styles in arm wrestling and then repeatedly injects him with heroin and cocaine. Blake hires a prostitute to have sex with Styles who is impaired with the drugs. She ignores the weakened Styles' objections and rapes him as Blake records the incident on video. After Blake and Kim deposit an unconscious Styles on the steps of City Hall, Alice overhears Styles' superiors telling him he has tested positive for gonorrhea, and believes he is cheating on her. Styles witnesses a video of Blake entering his daughters' room with a hatchet. Styles heads to the park where his family are watching a circus act, and holds a black-clad figure he believes to be Blake at gunpoint; the figure turns out to be a clown, making Styles seem unstable. Blake releases the recording of Styles' rape, making it appear as if Styles is soliciting prostitutes and causing District Attorney Priscilla Brimleigh to suspend him. With Styles determined to get his name cleared, Styles and Doyle beat information out of one of Blake's former AB allies. In an alley, Blake fatally shoots Doyle and plants Styles' fingerprints on the gun. Desperate, Styles contacts Odessa for help, bringing his family to the tenement building Odessa uses as a drug lab and placing them in Odessa's care. On the roof, Styles raves to the street below, apparently suicidal; this draws out Blake, who wants Styles to live a long, miserable life. Styles fakes his own death by blowing up Odessa's drug lab, secretly escaping the blast through a clothing chute as Blake watches in horror. Odessa's gang abducts Kim, and Odessa sends a message to Blake that Styles is alive and intends to find him, challenging him to come to the Watts Towers. When Blake arrives, he finds Kim tied to the scaffolding, and kills him in a fit of rage. Styles taunts Blake as the media descends on the scene and captures the two men fighting atop the towers, exonerating Styles. Eventually, Odessa applies electricity to the metal tower, electrocuting Blake before Styles throws him off the tower to his death. Styles reunites with his family and invites Odessa to play basketball with him again, an offer Odessa accepts before driving away.

Shelley's title compares the monster's creator, Victor Frankenstein, to the mythological character Prometheus, who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire. In Shelley's Gothic story, Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his laboratory through an ambiguous method based on a scientific principle he discovered. Shelley describes the monster as 8 feet (240 cm) tall and emotional. The monster attempts to fit into human society but is shunned, which leads him to seek revenge against Frankenstein. According to the scholar Joseph Carroll, the monster occupies \"a border territory between the characteristics that typically define protagonists and antagonists\". Frankenstein's monster became iconic in popular culture, and has been featured in various forms of media, including films, television series, merchandise and video games. The most popularly recognized versions are the film portrayals by Boris Karloff in the 1931 film Frankenstein, the 1935 sequel Bride of Frankenstein, and the 1939 sequel Son of Frankenstein.    Names   Mary Shelley's original novel does not give the character a specific name. In the novel, Victor Frankenstein variously refers to his creation as the \"creature\", \"fiend\", \"spectre\", \"dæmon\", \"wretch\", \"devil\", \"thing\", \"being\", and \"ogre\". Frankenstein's creation referred to himself as a \"monster\" at least once, as did the residents of a hamlet who saw the creature towards the end of the novel. As in Shelley's story, the creature's namelessness became a central part of the stage adaptations in London and Paris during the decades after the novel's first appearance. In 1823, Shelley herself attended a performance of Richard Brinsley Peake's Presumption, the first successful stage adaptation of her novel. \"The play bill amused me extremely, for in the list of dramatis personae came, -------- by Mr T. Cooke,\" she wrote to her friend Leigh Hunt. \"This nameless mode of naming the unnameable is rather good.\" Within a decade of publication, the name of the creator, \"Frankenstein\", was used to refer to the creature, but it did not become firmly established until much later. The story was adapted for the stage in 1927 by Peggy Webling, and Webling's Victor Frankenstein does give the creature his name. However, the creature has no name in the Universal film series starring Boris Karloff during the 1930s, which was largely based upon Webling's play. The 1931 Universal film treated the creature's identity in a similar way as Shelley's novel: in the opening credits, the character is referred to merely as \"The Monster\" (the actor's name is replaced by a question mark, but Karloff is listed in the closing credits). However, in the sequel Bride of Frankenstein (1935), the frame narration by a character representing Shelley's friend Lord Byron does refer to the monster as Frankenstein. Nevertheless, the creature soon enough became best known in the popular imagination as \"Frankenstein\". This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but some usage commentators regard the monster sense of \"Frankenstein\" as well-established and not an error. Modern practice varies somewhat. For example, in Dean Koontz's Frankenstein, first published in 2004, the creature is named \"Deucalion\", after the character from Greek mythology, who is the son of the Titan Prometheus, a reference to the original novel's title.  Another example is the second episode of Showtime's Penny Dreadful, which first aired in 2014. Victor Frankenstein briefly considers naming his creation \"Adam\", before deciding instead to let the monster \"pick his own name\". He is also referred to as Adam in the 2014 film I, Frankenstein, where the Queen of the Gargoyles Leonore gives him the name after understanding Victor never gave him one. Thumbing through a book of the works of William Shakespeare, the monster chooses \"Proteus\" from The Two Gentlemen of Verona. It is later revealed that Proteus is actually the second monster Frankenstein has created, with the first, abandoned creation having been named \"Caliban\", from The Tempest, by the theatre actor who took him in and later, after leaving the theatre, named himself after the English poet John Clare. Another example is an attempt by Randall Munroe of webcomic xkcd to make \"Frankenstein\" the canonical name of the monster, by publishing a short derivative version which directly states that it is. Brian Johnson( born 1939 or 1940) is a British designer and director of film and television special effects. 2 Girls 1 Cup is the unofficial nickname of the trailer for Hungry Bitches, a 2007 Brazilian scat fetish pornographic film produced by MFX Media. The trailer features two women defecating into a cup, taking turns in what appears to be consuming the excrement, and vomiting into each other's mouths. \"Lovers Theme\" by Hervé Roy plays throughout the video. The video became one of the best-known shock videos in itself and for the reactions its graphic content elicited from viewers who had not seen it before. Around mid-October 2007, video-sharing sites including YouTube were flooded with videos of the reactions of first-time viewers.    Production  Viewers often speculate that the apparent feces are actually food substances such as refried beans, ice cream, or peanut butter. Some speculate that the vomit is real, but was regurgitated before reaching the stomach and does not contain any gastric acids. In the video, the majority of the vomit does not enter the mouths. Pornographer Marco Antônio Fiorito unsuccessfully argued in a criminal court proceeding that the excrement was actually chocolate ice cream.    Background  The video originated from a Brazilian distributor and pornographer, Marco Antônio Fiorito (born 1 July 1971, in São Paulo), who describes himself as a \"compulsive fetishist\". Fiorito started having interest producing films in 1994, and in 1996, with his wife, Joelma Brito, using her artistic name Letícia Miller, he began a fetish film business and soon moved on to coprophagia. The film was produced by MFX Video, one of several companies owned by Fiorito. Authorities in the United States have branded some of Fiorito's films as obscene and filed charges against Danilo Croce, a Brazilian lawyer living in Florida, listed as an officer of a company distributing Fiorito's films in the United States. Fiorito explained that had he known that selling his films in the U.S. was illegal, he would have stopped. In his declaration he stated \"I would have stopped because the money is not the main reason that I make these films.\" He then added, \"I have already made fetish movies with scat/feces using chocolate instead of feces. Many actors make scat films, but they don't agree to eat feces.\" The first few seconds of the 2 Girls 1 Cup video contain the text \"MFX 1209\" (the production code for Hungry Bitches) and the URL mfxvideo.com, the website of Fiorito's MFX Video, leading some in the media to incorrectly believe the video is one of the many Croce had to surrender to the Department of Justice but was somehow leaked in the process.    Reaction videos  The popularity of 2 Girls 1 Cup was aided by a series of reaction videos; that is, videos depicting people reacting to watching it. Many videos exist on YouTube of users showing the original video (off-camera) to their friends and filming their reactions, although some may be staged. Even Joe Rogan, host of Fear Factor, a show notorious for the disgusting things its contestants are dared to eat, had to turn away in a reaction video posted to his blog. A reaction video starring a Kermit the Frog puppet proved very popular on the community-based website Digg. In January 2008, Slate documented the reaction video phenomenon with a slideshow featuring various reactions. Violet Blue, an author, described this website as becoming \"the new 'tubgirl' and goatse all in one disgusting moment of choco-poo-love\" in a San Francisco Chronicle article. Veteran porn star Ron Jeremy walked off while watching the video on The Playhouse. On the same program, singer Wyclef Jean sat through the whole thing without looking away or showing any apparent reaction, all while eating corn on the cob. Ace Frehley, formerly of Kiss, was shown the video on The Opie and Anthony Show in July 2009, and was unfazed, declaring, \"Crazier things than that have happened on the road.\"    Impact  A short film by guitarist John Mayer was made and uploaded to his blog, also entitled 2 Guys 1 Cup, where Mayer and Best Week Ever correspondent Sherrod Small enjoy Pinkberry frozen yogurt in the same manner that the women in the original consumed the feces. Comedian Conan O'Brien created a parody called One Guy, Two Bowls starring Andy Richter, which shows Andy eating two bowls of soup. This video was created for O'Brien's comedic website Conan.XXX. Filmmakers Justin Roiland and Christian Le Guilloux made a five-minute series called 2 Girls, 1 Cup: The Show for the short film competition site Channel 101. It debuted in first place on 27 January 2008. Howard Winchel Koch( April 11, 1916 – February 16, 2001) was an American producer and director of film and television. The Phantom is a 1996 superhero film directed by Simon Wincer. Based on Lee Falk's comic strip The Phantom by King Features, the film stars Billy Zane as a seemingly immortal crimefighter and his battle against all forms of evil. The Phantom also stars Treat Williams, Kristy Swanson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, James Remar and Patrick McGoohan. Principal photography began in October 1995 and concluded on February 13, 1996. The film was shot in California, Thailand and Australia. The Phantom was released on June 7, 1996, and received mixed reviews from film critics. Despite financial failure in its theatrical release, the film has enjoyed success on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray, and has developed a cult following.    Plot  In the early 16th century, a young boy helplessly witnesses his father killed by the evil Kabai Sengh, the ruthless pirate leader of the Sengh Brotherhood, who attacked their ship. The boy jumps overboard and is washed ashore on Bengalla, an island where local tribesmen find him and take him to their village. There he is given the Skull Ring, swears to devote his life to the destruction of piracy, greed, cruelty, and injustice, and as an adult, adopts the identity of \"The Phantom\", a masked avenger. The role of The Phantom is passed on from father to son through 400 years, leading people to believe in a single, immortal figure. In 1938, Kit Walker, the 21st Phantom, finds Quill leading a group of grave robbers in the jungle. They are searching a burial place for one of the Skulls of Touganda, which grants its owner a tremendously destructive power. The Phantom saves the native boy they kidnapped to be their guide and captures Quill's men, leaving them for the Jungle Patrol to pick up. Revealed to be a Sengh Brotherhood member and the man who killed Kit's father - whose ghost frequently appears to give Kit advice - Quill flees with the Skull and returns to the United States. In New York City, Kit's college ex-girlfriend, Diana Palmer, is a frequent traveler whose uncle, Dave Palmer, is the famous owner of the World Tribune newspaper. The paper has been investigating power-hungry businessman Xander Drax, a shady character with a reputation for dealing with criminals. Palmer has uncovered Drax's connection to a mysterious spider web symbol, which he traces back to the Bengalla Jungle. He sends Diana to investigate but makes the mistake of telling New York's corrupt police commissioner, who is allied with Drax, of Diana's trip. Drax's female air pirates led by femme fatale, Sala, hijack the plane; Diana is abducted and taken to their waterfront base in Bengalla. Having been informed of Diana's abduction by the Jungle Patrol's captain, Phillip Horton, the Phantom rescues her and escapes from Quill and his men to his headquarters, the Skull Cave. In New York, now dressed as his civilian self, Kit meets with David Palmer at the World Tribune and once again meets with Diana, who has mixed feelings about him since his sudden disappearance several years before. Diana's would-be suitor Jimmy Wells mentions he had seen one of the skulls in the Museum of World History, so Kit and Diana hurry there. Drax and his men capture them, steal the second Skull and unite it with the first, revealing the location of the third Skull on an uncharted island in the Andaman Sea, known as the Devil's Vortex. Kit manages to escape and, as the Phantom, evades the police outside the museum. Meanwhile, after Sala reveals that Diana is the Phantom's girlfriend, she flies Drax, Quill, and Diana to the Devil's Vortex, not knowing that the Phantom has managed to hitch a ride on one of the plane's landing pontoons. On the island, Drax meets with the pirate Kabai Sengh, direct descendant of the Brotherhood's original leader, who possesses the third Skull. Sengh warns Drax of the Fourth Skull's existence, which controls the power of the other three. The Phantom appears and battles both men, with Kabai Sengh killed by sharks, and Diana and Sala cooperate to defeat the other villains. Drax unites the three Skulls and turns their power against the Phantom; Quill is accidentally hit and disintegrated in the process. The Phantom uses the Fourth Skull – his own magic ring – to turn the Skulls' power back against them, destroying them and Drax in a powerful explosion. As the energy causes a volcanic eruption, the Phantom narrowly escapes with Diana and Sala. Returning to Bengalla, Diana reveals to the Phantom that she has figured out his secret and double identity. Kit removes his mask, telling her that he can only disclose all of his secrets to one person, the woman he intends to marry, but she leaves again for New York. Fred Dekker( born April 9, 1959) is an American screenwriter and film director best known for his cult classic horror comedy films\" Night of the Creeps\" and\" The Monster Squad\"( written with Shane Black). He contributed the story ideas for\" House\"( 1986) and\" Ricochet\"( 1991), and also directed and co-wrote\" RoboCop 3\" with Frank Miller. One of his earliest movies was a short film he made in college titled\" Starcruisers\", directed in the early 1980s. == Life and career ==\nDekker was born on April 9, 1959, in San Francisco and was raised in the Bay Area. He attended the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in the mid-1980s.\nIn 1983, film director Steve Miner hired Dekker to write the script for Godzilla: King of the Monsters in 3D, a project which went unproduced. Dekker's first success came in 1986: a 15-page Twilight Zone inspired script & an original story that was expanded into a full screenplay by writer Ethan Wiley for what would become the 1986 comedy horror film House. The film was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award at the Fantasporto Film Festival, and earned its director Steve Miner the Critics' Award at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival. That same year, Dekker made his directorial debut with Night of the Creeps, the script for which was written in only a week. The film, an homage to B-movies of the 1950s and 60s, has since become a cult classic.\nHis next film The Monster Squad was co-written with his friend and long-time collaborator Shane Black. It is an homage to the Universal \"monster cycle\" of films produced between the early 1930s to mid-1950s. Like his previous film, it has since become a cult classic. Dekker subsequently wrote five episodes of the Tales from the Crypt television series, and directed one. He co-wrote the neo-noir Ricochet and the spy comedy If Looks Could Kill. His return to the director's chair came in 1992 when he directed the third installment in the RoboCop series, co-writing the screenplay with comic book writer Frank Miller. The film, which had its release delayed by a year due to the bankruptcy of Orion Pictures, received negative reviews from critics and audiences. Dekker has since gone on to accept blame for the film's negative reception.\nDekker worked as a script doctor, making uncredited contributions to films including Titan A.E. and Lethal Weapon 4. He also wrote three episodes of Star Trek: Enterprise in the early 2000s. In 2015, after a lengthy hiatus, he returned to filmmaking by co-writing a television pilot, Edge, for Amazon Studios, with Black. He co-wrote the 2018 film The Predator with Black, who also directed the film.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\nUncredited works\n\nDemolition Man (1993)\nLethal Weapon 4 (1998)\nTitan A.E.

Hanro Smitsman, born in 1967 in Breda( Netherlands), is a writer and director of film and television. The Lighthorsemen is a 1987 Australian war film about the men of a World War I light horse unit involved in Sinai and Palestine campaign's 1917 Battle of Beersheeba.  The film is based on a true story and most of the characters in the film were based on real people. (Elyne Mitchell wrote the novelization based on the screenplay.) It follows in the wake of other Australian New Wave war films such as Breaker Morant (1980), Gallipoli (1981), and the 5-part TV series Anzacs (1985).  Recurring themes of these films include the Australian identity, such as mateship and larrikinism, the loss of innocence in war, and also the continued coming of age of the Australian nation and its soldiers (the Anzac spirit). The film was directed by Simon Wincer, and several pieces of footage from the climactic scenes were re-used in the episode \"Palestine, October 1917\" of the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.  This episode, which aired in 1993, likewise focuses on the Battle of Beersheeba, and was also directed by Wincer.    Plot  In 1917, four World War I Australian cavalrymen – Frank, Scotty, Chiller, and Tas – serve in Palestine as part of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, a unit of the British and Commonwealth forces. When Frank dies, he is replaced by Dave. Dave finds himself unable to fire his weapon in combat and is transferred to the Medical Corps, where he will not need to carry a weapon, but will still be exposed to the fighting. The British plan the capture of Beersheba. During an attack by Turkish cavalry, Major Richard Meinertzhagen deliberately leaves behind documents that indicate the attack on Beersheba will only be a diversion. The Australians leave for Beersheba with limited water and supplies. They bombard the town and the 4,000 Turkish-German defenders prepare for an assault. However, the German military advisor, Reichert, believes it is a diversionary attack and advises the Turkish commander that he does not need reinforcements. With time running out and water in short supply, British commanders suspect any attack upon Beersheba will probably fail. The Australian commanders ask the British to send in the Australian Light Horse. The British consent to what they think is a suicide mission. On 31 October, the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments are ordered to attack the Turks. Dave and the rest of the medical detachment prepare for casualties and are ordered in behind the Light Horse. The Turks report the Australian mounted soldiers lining up to charge, but the officer in charge orders the Turks not to open fire until they dismount because he recognises they are light horse, riding for mobility but not trained or equipped for true cavalry combat. The Australians advance on the Turkish positions and gradually speed up to a charge. The Turks realise too late that the soldiers are not dismounting and open fire. Artillery fire is sporadic and of limited effect, and the attack is so fast the Turkish infantry forget to adjust the sights on their rifles, which causes them to fire over the Australians' heads. During the charge, Tas is killed by an artillery shell. The Australians advance faster than the Turkish artillery can correct its aim for the reduced range and reach the Turkish trenches. The Australians capture the first line of Turkish defenses. Scotty and a few others take control of the guns. Chiller is wounded in the trench fight. Dave is struck by a grenade and is seriously wounded while he protects Chiller. Scotty continues to fight on into the town. When most of the remaining Turkish soldiers surrender, Reichert tries to destroy the wells but is captured by Scotty. The attack is judged a success, with the Australians sustaining only 31 dead and 36 wounded. The successful attack on Beersheba allows for the subsequent capture of Jerusalem and the rest of Palestine. In deference to Jerusalem's status as the Holy City, British commander General Allenby walks into the city as a liberator, rather than making a conqueror's triumphal entry.    Cast     Production  The script was written by Ian Jones, who had long been interested in the Australian Light Horse ever since they featured in an episode of Matlock Police in 1971. He visited Beersheba in 1979 and had carefully researched the period. Simon Wincer came on board as director and he succeeded in helping secure a $6 million pre sale to RKO. Antony I. Ginnane's Film and General Holdings Company succeeded in raising the rest of the money. Simon Wincer later claimed that Ginanne, Ian Jones and himself had to put in their own money at some stage when the film looked like falling over. The Cup is a 2011 Australian biographical film about the 2002 Melbourne Cup race, won by the Dermot Weld trained Media Puzzle. And is directed by Simon Wincer. It is about Damien Oliver's victory in the 2002 Melbourne Cup. This was Bill Hunter's final film before his death. == Plot ==\nThe Melbourne Cup is called The Race That Stops a Nation, but never in the history of Australia's 150-year-old Thoroughbred Classic has there been so dramatic a contest as the 2002 running. The Cup follows the world's finest horsemen as they plot their paths across the globe – from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia – and into the Winners Circle of the richest and most prestigious two-mile handicap. But the heart of this true story is a young Australian jockey, Damien Oliver, who loses his only brother in a tragic racing accident just days before the great race. To make matters worse, the same fate claimed Damien and Jason Oliver's father decades before. Following his brother's death, Damien suffers through an almost endless series of discouraging defeats only to triumph on one of sport's greatest stages in one of the most thrilling finales in all of sport.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nBrendan Gleeson as Dermot Weld\nStephen Curry as Damien Oliver\nDaniel MacPherson as Jason Oliver\nTom Burlinson as Dave Phillips\nJodi Gordon as Trish Oliver\nMartin Sacks as Neil Pinner\nShaun Micallef as Lee Freedman\nBill Hunter as Bart Cummings\nColleen Hewett as Pat Oliver\nNick Simpson-Deeks as Pat Smullen\nReg Gorman as Vern\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Cup received mixed to negative reviews, currently holding a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 26%.\nJoe Leydon of Variety gave a positive review, saying \"Although it canters down a well-trod path toward a predictable finish line, The Cup sustains interest through the smooth efficiency of its storytelling and the engaging performances of its lead players.\" Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald called it \"a shamelessly old-fashioned picture but if you like horses and fancy cantering off into the land of wish-fulfilment for a couple of hours, why not?\"\nLuke Buckmaster of Crikey.com gave a negative review, saying \"Director Simon Wincer was not the right person to avoid certain temptations, like dunking the audience's noggins into a honey pot of clichés.\" Mike McGranaghan of Aisle Seat thought the film was a \"pleasant-enough viewing experience. At the same time, I was never as riveted as I have been by other, similarly-themed films. It makes you feel good without ever truly stirring the soul.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of films about horse racing\nThe Cup (book) The 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup was the sixth FIFA Women's World Cup competition, the world championship for women's national football teams. It was held from 26 June to 17 July 2011 in Germany, which won the right to host the event in October 2007. Japan won the final against the United States on a penalty shoot-out following a 2–2 draw after extra time and became the first Asian team to win a senior FIFA World Cup. The matches were played in nine stadiums in nine host cities around the country, with the final played at the Commerzbank Arena in Frankfurt. Sixteen teams were selected for participation via a worldwide qualification tournament that began in 2009. In the first round of the tournament finals, the teams competed in round-robin groups of four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These eight teams advanced to the knockout stage, where two rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the final.    Host selection   Six nations, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Peru and Switzerland, initially declared their interest in hosting the 2011 Women's World Cup. The German Football Association announced its hopes to host the tournament on 26 January 2006, following a pledge from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to fully support a potential bid. All six nations officially announced their interest by a 1 March 2007 deadline and acknowledged their intention of bidding by 3 May 2007 to FIFA. The final bidding dossiers had to be handed over before 1 August 2007. Switzerland withdrew on 29 May 2007, stating that Europe is heavily focused on France and Germany, and a third European bid appeared futile. On 27 August 2007, France also withdrew, reportedly in exchange for Germany's support for their bid to host the men's UEFA Euro 2016. Later Australia (12 October 2007) and Peru (17 October 2007) voluntarily dropped out of the race as well, leaving only Canada and Germany as the remaining candidates. On 30 October 2007, the FIFA Executive Committee voted to assign the tournament to Germany. Canada was eventually awarded the 2015 Women's World Cup four years later. Upon the selection, Germany became the third country to host both men's and women's World Cup, having hosted the men's twice in 1974 and 2006.    Venues  After the German Football Association (DFB) expressed its intention to bid for the Women's World Cup, 23 German cities applied to host World Cup games. Twelve cities were chosen for the official bidding dossier handed over to FIFA in August 2007. On 30 September 2008, the DFB executive committee decided to use nine stadiums for the tournament; the original candidates Essen, Magdeburg and Bielefeld were not chosen as World Cup venues. The official opening game was held between Germany and Canada at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, the venue of the 2006 men's World Cup final; it was the only match played in Berlin. However, it was not the first match of the tournament—it was preceded by a match at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim pitting France and Nigeria. The final of the tournament took place at the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, the venue of the 2005 men's Confederations Cup final. Borussia-Park in Mönchengladbach and Frankfurt's Commerzbank-Arena hosted the semi-finals. The third place play-off was held at Rhein-Neckar-Arena. Since 2007, five of the stadiums were either newly built (Augsburg, Dresden and Sinsheim) or remodelled (Bochum and Leverkusen). Six stadiums would be home grounds for German First Bundesliga clubs in the upcoming 2011–12 season, while the other three would be home to Second Bundesliga clubs in the same season. Compared to the 2006 men's World Cup, several smaller venues were chosen; six stadiums have a capacity of 20,000 to 30,000 seats. All cities would stage a total of four matches, with the exceptions of Berlin and Mönchengladbach; the latter would host three games. The total capacity of the nine venues is roughly 330,000. Overall, approximately one million tickets would be available. Several of the stadiums were officially referred to simply as \"FIFA Women's World Cup Stadium\" because FIFA prohibited sponsorship of stadiums unless the stadium sponsors were also official tournament sponsors. With no standing-room terraces allowed, all stadiums had a lower total capacity compared to German Bundesliga games. Capacity data is given according to FIFA:    Teams and qualification     Number of participating teams  FIFA had considered the prospect of increasing the number of teams from 16 to 24, to reflect the growing global popularity of women's football and the Women's World Cup. Peter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre. Monster Squad is a television series produced by D'Angelo-Bullock-Allen Productions that aired Saturday mornings on NBC from September 11, 1976, to September 3, 1977. It is unrelated to the later film of the same name.    Premise  The series stars Fred Grandy as Walt, a criminology student working as a night watchman at \"Fred's Wax Museum\". To pass the time, Walt built a prototype \"Crime Computer\" hidden in a large stone sarcophagus near an exhibit of legendary monsters. When Walt plugged in his computer, \"oscillating vibrations\" brought to life the wax statues of Dracula (Henry Polic II), the Wolfman (Buck Kartalian) who here was named \"Bruce W. Wolf\" (with one episode revealing that the \"W\" stood for \"Were\"), and the Frankenstein Monster (Michael Lane) who was referred to as \"Frank N. Stein\" in the credits. The monsters, wanting to make up for the misdeeds of their pasts, became superhero crimefighters who used their unique abilities to challenge and defeat various supervillains. In most episodes, Walt would send the monsters out to investigate crimes and fight the villains while monitoring the activities from the wax museum via the Crime Computer, presumably because his job required him to be at the wax museum at all times. However, Walt would sometimes join the climactic battle with his comrades in some episodes and come to the rescue when needed. Though the Squad are supposed to be wax statues, it often appears that they are something else entirely, as they apparently have all the memories of the monsters they are based on as well as their powers. The gentle giant Frank, for example, possessed superhuman strength and could smash through walls, while the dapper cloak-clad and fearsome-fanged Drac could turn into a bat, and the short and furry Bruce was a ferocious fighter who could climb up the sheer sides of buildings Spider-Man-style and had a super-sensitive sense of smell. The Squad had their own customized black Monster Van, and each monster had a \"utility belt\" with a communicator device used to keep in touch with Walt, who had apparently created them for the monsters to use. Their CB-style codenames were \"Chamber of Horrors\" (Walt), \"Nightflyer\" (Drac), \"Green Machine\" (Frank) and \"Furball\" (Bruce). The show was comparable to the 1960s Batman TV show, not surprising considering that creator Stanley Ralph Ross had been one of the main writers on that series. The villains were often exaggerated camp super-villains much like the ones on Batman in keeping with the \"superhero\" tone of the show, and were often played by familiar-faced guest stars of the time, like Alice Ghostley (\"Queen Bee\"), Marty Allen (\"Lorenzo Musica\"), Jonathan Harris (\"the Astrologer\"), Julie Newmar (\"Ultra Witch\"), Avery Schreiber (\"the Weatherman\") and Vito Scotti (\"Albert/Alberta\"). In several episodes, a statue of the Invisible Man can be seen in an alcove on the opposite side of the monsters' exhibit. It is never explained why this statue remains unaffected by the Crime Computer's oscillating vibrations.    Cast     Main  Fred Grandy – Walt Henry Polic II –  Dracula Buck Kartalian – Bruce W.

Plot  Matthew Quigley is an American cowboy with a specially modified rifle with which he can shoot accurately at extraordinary distances. Seeing a newspaper advertisement that asks for a man with his special talent, he answers using just four words: \"M. Quigley 900 yards\", written on a copy of the advertisement that is punctured by six closely spaced bullet holes. When he arrives in Australia, he gets into a fight with employees of the man who hired him as they try to force \"Crazy Cora\" onto their wagon. After he identifies himself, he is taken to the station of Elliot Marston, who informs Quigley his sharpshooting skills will be used to eradicate the increasingly elusive Aboriginal Australians. Quigley turns down the offer and throws Marston out of his own house. When the Aboriginal manservant knocks Quigley over the head, Marston's men beat him and Cora unconscious and dump them in the Outback with no water and little chance of survival. However, they are rescued by Aboriginal Australians. Cora now reveals that she comes from Texas. When her home was attacked by Comanches, she hid in the root cellar and accidentally suffocated her child while trying to prevent him from crying. Her husband had then put her alone on a ship to Australia. Now Cora consistently calls Quigley by her husband's name (Roy), much to his annoyance. When Marston's men attack the Aboriginal Australians who helped them, Quigley kills three. Escaping on a horse, they encounter more of the men driving Aboriginal Australians over a cliff. Quigley drives them off with his deadly shooting and Cora rescues an orphaned baby she finds among the dead. Leaving Cora and the infant in the desert with food and water, Quigley rides alone to a nearby town. There he obtains new ammunition from a local German gunsmith, who hates Marston for his murdering ways. Quigley learns as well that he has become a legendary hero among the Aboriginal Australians. Marston's men are also in town and recognize Quigley's saddle. When they attack, cornering him in a burning building, he escapes through a skylight and kills all but one of them. The injured survivor is sent back to say Quigley will be following. Quigley returns to Cora and the baby, which she has just saved from an attack by dingoes. She had tried to stop that child from crying too but finally let him make as much noise as he liked as she killed the animals using a revolver that Quigley had left for her. Back in town, Cora gives the baby to Aboriginal Australians trading there after Quigley tells her that she (Cora) has a right to happiness. Next morning, Quigley rides away to confront Marston at his station. At first he shoots the defenders from his location in the hills but is eventually shot in the leg and captured by Marston's last two men. Marston, who has noticed that Quigley only ever carries a rifle, decides to give him a lesson in the \"quick-draw\" style of gun fighting. Marston and his men are beaten to the draw by Quigley; as Marston lies dying, Quigley refers to an earlier conversation, telling him, \"I said I never had much use for one [a revolver]; never said I didn't know how to use it\". Marston's servant comes out of the house and gives Quigley his rifle back. The servant then walks away from the ranch, stripping off his western-style clothing as he goes. A British cavalry troop now arrives to arrest Quigley, until they notice the surrounding hills are lined with Aboriginal Australians and decide to withdraw. Later Quigley and Cora book a passage back to America in the name of Cora's husband, since Quigley is wanted. On the wharf, she reminds him that he once told her that she had to say two words before he could make love to her. Smiling broadly, she calls him \"Matthew Quigley\" and the two embrace.    Cast     Production     Development  John Hill first began writing Quigley Down Under in 1974. He was inspired by a Los Angeles Times article about the genocide of the aborigines in 19th-century Australia. Although Westerns were in decline in the 1970s, Hill said that the script \"opened a lot of doors for me,\" and led to other assignments. The script was first optioned in 1979 by producer Mort Engelberg for Steve McQueen, with whom he teamed on The Hunter; however McQueen died of cancer shortly after completing The Hunter. The script was bought by CBS Theatrical Films where it was attached to director Rick Rosenthal. The 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup was the tenth Cricket World Cup. It was played in India, Sri Lanka, and for the first time in Bangladesh. India won the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, thus becoming the first country to win the Cricket World Cup final on home soil. India's Yuvraj Singh was declared as the player of the tournament. This was the first time in World Cup history that two Asian teams had appeared in the final. It was also the first time since the 1992 World Cup that the final did not feature Australia. Fourteen national cricket teams took part in this tournament, including 10 full members and four associate members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). The opening ceremony was held on 17 February 2011 at Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka, and the tournament was played between 19 February and 2 April. The first match was played between India and Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka. Pakistan was also scheduled to be a co-host, but after the 2009's terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team in Lahore, the ICC cancelled that, and the headquarters of the organising committee, originally in Lahore, was transferred to Mumbai. Pakistan was to have held 14 matches, including one semi-final. Eight of the games (including the semi-final) were awarded to India, four to Sri Lanka, and two to Bangladesh.    Host selection  The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced on 30 April 2006 which countries would host the 2011 World Cup. Australia and New Zealand had also bid for the tournament; if successful, they would have shared the hosting equally, leaving the location of the final still to be decided. The Trans–Tasman bid, Beyond Boundaries, was the only one delivered to the ICC headquarters in Dubai before the 1 March deadline, but the Asian bidders were granted an extension by the ICC. The New Zealand government had given assurance that Zimbabwe would be allowed to compete in the tournament, following political discussions in the country over whether their cricket team should be allowed to tour Zimbabwe in 2005. The extra time needed for the Asian bid had weakened its prospects, but when the time came to vote, Asia won the hosting rights by ten votes to three. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has revealed that the vote of the West Indies Cricket Board was decisive, as the Asian bid had the support of South Africa and Zimbabwe as well as the four bidding countries. The Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported that the Asian countries had promised to hold fund-raising events for West Indian cricket during the 2007 World Cup, which may have influenced the vote. However, I. S. Bindra, chairman of the Monitoring Committee of the Asian bid, said that their promise of extra profits of around US$400 million had been decisive, that there \"was no quid pro quo for their support\", and that playing the West Indies had \"nothing to do with the World Cup bid\".    Format  Late in 2007, the four host nations agreed on a revised format for the 2011 World Cup, identical to that of the 1996 World Cup, except that there would be 14 teams instead of 12. The first round of the tournament would consist of two groups of seven teams. Each team in a group would play all the others once, and the top four from each group would qualify for the quarter-finals. This ensured that every team would play at least six matches.    Qualification   As per ICC regulations, all 10 full members automatically qualify for the World Cup, including Zimbabwe who have given up their Test playing status until the standard of their team improves. The ICC also organised a qualifying tournament in South Africa to determine the four associate teams who would participate in the 2011 event. Ireland, who had been the best performing associate nation since the last World Cup, won the tournament, beating Canada in the final. The Netherlands and Kenya also qualified by virtue of finishing third and fourth respectively. All 4 associates kept their ODI status as well as Scotland who this time failed to qualify for the World Cup.    List of qualified teams  The following 14 teams qualified for the final tournament.    Preparations     Pakistan loses co-host status  In April 2009, the ICC announced that Pakistan had lost its right to co-host the 2011 World Cup because of concerns about the \"uncertain security situation\" in the country, especially in the aftermath of the 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team in Lahore. The PCB estimated that this would lose them $10.5 million. This figure took account only of the fees of $750,000 per match guaranteed by the ICC.

The Monster Squad is a 1987 American horror comedy film directed by Fred Dekker, and written by Dekker and Shane Black. Peter Hyams and Rob Cohen served as executive producers. It was released by TriStar Pictures on August 14, 1987. The film features pastiches of the Universal Monsters, led by Count Dracula. They are confronted by a group of savvy kids out to keep them from controlling the world. While being financially unsuccessful during its theatrical run and receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film has gained a positive reception from audiences and has become a cult classic in the years since its release.    Plot  The Monster Squad is a club of pre-teens who idolize the Universal classic monster movies and their non-human stars. Club leader Sean Crenshaw, whose younger sister, Phoebe, desperately wants to join the club, is given the diary of legendary monster hunter Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, but his excitement abates when he finds it is written in German. Sean and the rest of the Monster Squad – his best friend and second in command Patrick Rhodes, clumsy Horace, tough older kid Rudy and little Eugene – go to visit an elderly man known as the \"Scary German Guy\", actually a kind gentleman and a former concentration camp prisoner, to translate the diary. The diary describes an amulet that is composed of concentrated good. One day out of every century, as the forces of good and evil reach a balance, the otherwise-indestructible amulet becomes vulnerable. With the next day of balance happening within a few days at the stroke of midnight, the kids realize they must gain possession of the amulet and use it – with an incantation from Van Helsing's diary – to open a wormhole in the universe and cast the monsters into Limbo. As shown in the film's prelude, Van Helsing had unsuccessfully attempted this one hundred years ago to defeat his old adversary Count Dracula; his apprentices then emigrated to the United States to hide the amulet out of Dracula's reach. Nevertheless, Dracula seeks to obtain the amulet so that he can take over the world. To this end, he assembles several monstrous allies: The Mummy, the Gill-man, The Wolf Man, and three school girls whom the Count transforms into his vampiric consorts. Dracula then steals a crate containing Frankenstein's monster from a B-25 Mitchell in flight, thus completing his army. However, Frankenstein's monster is reluctant to aid Dracula, and wanders into the forest where he encounters Phoebe. Rather than being afraid, she shows him the kindness he has always sought, and they become friends. After Phoebe proves to the Monster Squad that Frankenstein's monster is not evil, he chooses to help the boys instead of Dracula. The amulet is buried in a stone room beneath a house that Dracula and the other monsters now occupy and where Van Helsing's diary was found. The room is littered with wards which prevent the monsters from taking it. The Monster Squad break into the house, acquire the amulet and narrowly escape Dracula's grasp. They confer with Scary German Guy who informs them that the incantation must be read by a female virgin. In revenge for their meddling, Dracula destroys the Squad's clubhouse, thereby drawing Police Detective Del Crenshaw, Sean and Phoebe's father, into the fray. As midnight approaches, the Squad makes their way to a local cathedral to make their last stand. The doors to the cathedral are locked, so the incantation must be read on the stoop, leaving the Squad vulnerable. They enlist Patrick's elder sister Lisa to help them, as she is the only virgin they know, but the incantation fails since Lisa is actually not a virgin anymore. As the monsters close in, the Squad deduces that Phoebe must complete the task of opening the portal, and Scary German Guy attempts to help her read the incantation while the Squad and Detective Crenshaw fend off the monsters. In the ensuing battle, Dracula's consorts, the Mummy, the Gill-man and the Wolfman are defeated. Dracula arrives to destroy the amulet when Frankenstein's monster intervenes, impaling him on a wrought-iron cross. Phoebe finishes the incantation, opening the portal, which begins to consume the bodies of the monsters. Dracula, still alive, attempts to drag Sean in with him, but Sean impales Dracula with a wooden stake as Patrick grabs Sean before he gets pulled in with Dracula. Having briefly escaped from Limbo, Van Helsing appears and pulls Dracula to his doom. As Frankenstein's monster is drawn into the portal, Phoebe holds onto him and pleads for him to stay. Knowing he does not belong on Earth, Frankenstein's monster lets go of Phoebe's hand, but accepts her gift of a stuffed animal to remember her by.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Location   The town lies on the River Usk, on the southern edge of the Black Mountains and in the eastern part of the Brecon Beacons National Park. Significant parts of the surrounding countryside, over 20,000 acres (81 km2), form part of the Glanusk Park estate.    Etymology and language  The name Crickhowell is an anglicised spelling that corresponds to the Welsh Crucywel. The name is derived from Crug Hywel, meaning 'Hywel's mound'. This is usually identified with the Iron Age hill fort on nearby Table Mountain, although this has the local name of Mynydd y Begwn. It may be that Crug Hywel refers to the castle mound in the town itself. The language of Crickhowell (and Llangynidr) was originally Welsh. In his 1893 book Wales and her language, John E. Southall, reports that over 60% of the population of Crickhowell spoke Welsh, although the town was only a few miles from more anglicised Abergavenny.    The town   Public services in Crickhowell are provided by Powys County Council and to a lesser extent by Crickhowell Town Council. Planning matters fall to the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority. There is a  primary school and a secondary school; both act as a central point for a large catchment area. There is some light industry on the outskirts of Crickhowell at the Elvicta Industrial Estate. The town centre includes a variety of traditional businesses, many of which are family owned. Other facilities in Crickhowell include a library, two play areas, public toilets and the CRiC building, which houses a tourist information centre, an internet cafe, an art gallery and a local history archive. There are pubs, cafes, restaurants and two hotels: \"The Bear\" and \"The Dragon\". The churches in Crickhowell include St Edmund's Church which holds a service every Sunday, Crickhowell Evangelical Church, a Baptist church and a Catholic church. In 2015, Crickhowell appeared in a TV documentary, claiming it as the first British settlement to purposely use similar tax avoidance tactics used by multinational businesses to avoid paying taxes themselves, in protest at the way large corporations use legal loopholes to avoid paying UK corporation tax. A market and fair have been recorded since 1281.    Governance  An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes The Vale of Grwyney community and has a total population of 2,801 as of the 2011 census. The current councillor is John Morris, a Liberal Democrat.    Tourism  Today, Crickhowell is a popular tourist destination. In 2005 a tourist information centre was built in the centre of town and during summer the town is notably busier. Many people visit Crickhowell to see the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons, and perhaps to enjoy some mountain-biking, camping, hillwalking, rock climbing, fly-fishing, hang-gliding or caravanning, or simply to tour the area by car, staying in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. The Green Man Festival takes place annually in mid-August at nearby Glanusk Park.    Notable buildings  Notable features in Crickhowell include the seventeenth-century stone bridge over the River Usk with its odd arches (twelve on one side, thirteen on the other) and its seat built into the walls, the 14th-century parish church of St Edmund, and the ruins of Crickhowell Castle on the green \"tump\" set back from the A40 Brecon to Abergavenny road.    Market Hall  Crickhowell Market Hall (originally the Town Hall) on The Square dates from 1834, nowadays with market stalls on the ground floor and a cafe in the first floor old courtroom. In 2007 Powys County Council handed over responsibility of the hall to a charity, the Market Hall Trust.

Cwrt y Gollen(\" Hazel Court\") was a British Army training base, 2 miles( 3 km) south- east of Crickhowell and just north of the A40 road and the River Usk, in southeastern Powys, Wales.  The Elan Valley Reservoirs (Welsh: Cronfeydd Cwm Elan) are a chain of man-made lakes created from damming the Elan and Claerwen rivers within the Elan Valley in Mid Wales. The reservoirs, which were built by the Birmingham Corporation Water Department, provide clean drinking water for Birmingham in the West Midlands of England. The five lakes are known as the Claerwen, Craig-goch, Pen-y-garreg, Garreg-ddu, and Caban-coch. Water from the reservoirs is carried by gravity to Frankley Reservoir in Birmingham via the Elan aqueduct. Pumping is not required because the network drops 52 metres (171 ft) along its 73-mile (117 km) length from its source to Frankley. A gradient of 1:2,300 maintains a flow of less than 2 miles per hour (3.2 km/h); water takes one and a half to two days to reach Birmingham. The aqueduct, which was started in 1896 and opened in 1906, crosses several valleys and features numerous brick tunnels, pipelines, and valve houses. Work to build the Elan Valley reservoirs was undertaken because the rapid growth of the industrial city of Birmingham in the late 19th century had led to a lack of available clean water. Numerous outbreaks of disease prompted Birmingham City Council to petition the British government which passed the Birmingham Corporation Water Act in 1892. It allowed the corporation to acquire by compulsory purchase all the land within the water catchment area of the Elan Valleys. Thousands of navvies (workers) and their families lived in the purpose-built Elan Village during the construction of the first four dams at the turn of the 20th century. In 1952, the Claerwen dam was opened by Elizabeth II in one of her first official engagements as monarch. Drinking water from the Elan Valley is noted for being exceptionally soft, contrasting with water from local supplies in the West Midlands, not served by the Elan aqueduct, which are noted for hardness. The reservoirs are now owned and managed by Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water. The water filtration works further down the valley is run by Severn Trent Water.    Description   There are four main dams and reservoirs (constructed 1893–1904 in Elan Valley, and 1946–1952 at Claerwen) with a potential total capacity of nearly 100,000 megalitres. The dams and reservoirs are:  Caban-coch – 35,530 megalitre capacity Pen-y-garreg – 6,055 megalitre capacity Craig-goch – 9,220 megalitre capacity Claerwen – 48,694 megalitre capacity In addition to the four main dams, there are three other dams at the site:  The Dol-y-mynach dam – it was to be one of a series of three dams that would be built to contain the waters of Afon Claerwen. They were to be constructed in accordance with the growth of Birmingham. However, the project was never completed even though the masonry foundations of the first dam were laid at the same time the Elan Valley dams were being constructed. The work had to be done in advance because the water level of the Caban Coch would have submerged the site once the reservoir was full. The three-dam project became redundant when newer materials and superior engineering allowed the construction of the single larger Claerwen dam higher up the valley in the 1940/50s. The Nant-y-Gro dam – this small dam was constructed in the early stages of the project to supply water to the navvies' village at the site; it was used during the Second World War by Sir Barnes Wallis during trials of the explosive charges he intended to use in the bouncing bombs which later targeted the Ruhr dams in Germany. The Garreg-ddu dam – although looking like a viaduct, it is actually a submerged dam. Its role is to maintain a sufficient level in the Garreg-ddu reservoir so water can enter the Foel Tower and the gravity-driven aqueduct to the Frankley Reservoir in Birmingham. The dam is only required to operate during times of extreme drought.    History     Construction   The Elan dam scheme was developed in the 19th century following rapid growth of the population of Birmingham due to the Industrial Revolution. The city's expansion resulted in regular outbreaks of water-borne diseases and major epidemics such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery due to the lack of clean water. Victorian politician Joseph Chamberlain, the leader of Birmingham City Council, began a campaign to get clean water from the Elan and Claerwen valleys in mid Wales. Keshar -e Bala( also Romanized as Keshār -e Bālā and Kashār -e Bālā; also known as Kashār -e ‘ Olyā, Kashar ‘ Olya, and Kishār Bāla) is a village in Kohurestan Rural District, in the Central District of Khamir County, Hormozgan Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 2,032, in 461 families. Hay-on-Wye (Welsh: Y Gelli Gandryll; Welsh pronunciation: [ə ˈɡɛɬi ˈgandrɪɬ]), known locally as Hay (Welsh: Y Gelli), is a market town and community in Powys, Wales, in the historic county of Brecknockshire. With over twenty bookshops, it is often described as a \"town of books\"; it is both the National Book Town of Wales and the site of the annual Hay Festival. The population of the town in 1841 was 1,455; this had grown to 1,680 by 1901. The town has grown little since, with 2018 estimates at 1,900. The built-up area includes Cusop across the border in Herefordshire, England and has a population of around 2,000. The town is twinned with Redu, a village in the Belgian municipality of Libin, and with Timbuktu, Mali, West Africa. Hay-on-Wye was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.    Location  The town lies on the south-east bank of the River Wye and is within the north-easternmost tip of the Brecon Beacons National Park, just north of the Black Mountains. The town is just on the Welsh side of the border with Herefordshire, England, here defined by the Dulas Brook. Where the brook joins the River Wye just north of the town, the border continues northwards along the river. The Wye was the boundary between the former counties and districts of Radnorshire and Brecknockshire. The adjacent village of Cusop lies on the English side of the Dulas Brook. The nearest city is Hereford, county town of Herefordshire, some 22 miles (35 km) to the east.  An area known as \"Kilvert country\" includes the town of Hay-on-Wye and the villages of Clyro, Capel-y-ffin, Llowes, Glasbury, Llanigon, Painscastle, Clifford and Whitney-on-Wye.    Etymology  The settlement's name is first referred to between 1135 and 1147 as Haya; in 1299 the name of La Haye is used. By the 16th century it was simply called Hay, and the use of the river as a suffix is a later addition. In 1215, a Welsh name, Gelli was recorded, and Gelli gandrell in 1614; the two names may have been used concurrently in 1625. The English language name, Hay, is derived from Old English hæg, possibly meaning a \"fenced area\" and a noun used in late Saxon and Norman times for an enclosure in a forest. The Welsh word celli (lenited to Gelli) has a range of meanings, including wooded areas of various extents.    History   Hay-on-Wye, like Builth Wells, has two Norman castles within a short distance of each other. It seems likely that Hay was first fortified by William Fitz Osbern during his penetration of south-east Wales in the summer of 1070, when he defeated three Welsh kings. The history of the site then continues through the lordships of the de Neufmarchés, which was confirmed at the Battle of Brecon in 1093, and also the Gloucester/Hereford families until 1165, when the district of Brycheiniog passed into the hands of the de Braose dynasty of Marcher Lords. In 1230 Hay Castle passed to the de Bohuns and the local history, including the battle near Hay in 1231, is continued through the Mortimer Wars of the 1260s and the battle near Brecon in 1266 down to the death of Earl Humphrey de Bohun in 1298.    First castle  Lying close to St Mary's Church on the western edge of Hay-on-Wye is a small but well-preserved motte. The site overlooks a gorge and small stream, locally known as The Login Brook, that flows into the River Wye, which was undoubtedly one reason for the construction of a motte and bailey castle there. A recently levelled platform under the car park to the northeast may once have housed the castle's bailey. This little fortress was probably the work of William Revel, a knight of Bernard de Neufmarché who is usually referred to as Bernard Newmarch, and may later have been the seat for the manor or commote of Melinog.    Stone castle   The main fortress within Hay-on-Wye was situated on the great site commanding the town and river, under the current ruins of the castle and mansion. The English lordship of Hay passed by marriage to Miles of Gloucester and then into the de Braose family. Gamizaj -e Olya( also Romanized as Gāmīzaj -e ‘ Olya and Gāmīzej -e ‘ Olyā; also known as Gāmizaj, Gāmīzaj -e Bālā, Gamīzej- e Bālā, and Garmizak) is a village in Sar Firuzabad Rural District, Firuzabad District, Kermanshah County, Kermanshah Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 275, in 48 families. Jafarabad( also Romanized as Ja‘farābād; also known as Ja‘farābād -e Bālā, Ja‘farābād -e ‘ Olya, and Ja’far Abad Olya) is a village in Solgi Rural District, Khezel District, Nahavand County, Hamadan Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 159, in 37 families. Welshpool (Welsh: Y Trallwng ) is a market town and community in Powys, Wales, historically in the county of Montgomeryshire. The town is four miles (six kilometres) from the Wales–England border and low-lying on the River Severn. The community, which also includes Cloddiau and Pool Quay, has a population of 6,664 (as of the 2011 United Kingdom census), with the town having 5,948. There are many examples of Georgian architecture within the town. Powis Castle is located to the north.    Toponym  Y Trallwng is the Welsh language name of the town. It means \"the marshy or sinking land\". In English it was initially known as Pool but its name was changed to Welshpool in 1835 to distinguish it from the English town of Poole in Dorset.     History   St Cynfelin is reputed to be the founder of two churches in the town, St Mary's and St Cynfelin's, during the Age of the Saints in the 5th and 6th centuries. The parish of Welshpool roughly coincides with the medieval commote of Ystrad Marchell in the cantref of Ystlyg in the Kingdom of Powys. The Long Mountain, which plays as a backdrop to most of Welshpool, once served as the ultimate grounds for defence for fortresses in the times when the town was just a swampy marsh. Welshpool served briefly as the capital of Powys Wenwynwyn or South Powys after its prince was forced to flee the traditional Welsh royal site at Mathrafal in 1212, by the prince of Gwynedd; assistance from the English crown (enemies of the Gwynedd prince) restored the Wenwynwyn dynasty to their lands. Further disputes with Gwynedd again brought in the English; in 1284, the family strengthened their hold on Powys Wenwynwyn by converting it into a marcher lordship (via surrender and re-grant) - the Lordship of Powys. Owain, the heir to the former principality, called himself Owen de la Pole, after the town. The town was devastated by the forces of Owain Glyndŵr (heir to Powys Fadog - North Powys) in 1400 at the start of his rebellion against the English king Henry IV. Today, the waymarked, 135-mile long-distance footpath and National Trail, Glyndŵr's Way, ends in Pont Howell Park, alongside the Montgomery Canal. In 1411 the priest at the church St Mary's was Adam of Usk.    Population  The population of Welshpool has risen since 2001.    Villages  Gungrog    Historic buildings     St Mary's Church is a Grade I listed building. The original church dated from about 1250,  there are remains of this church in the lower courses of the church tower. The nave was rebuilt in the 16th century, and the whole building was substantially restored in 1871. The 15th century chancel ceiling may have come from Strata Marcella Abbey, about five miles (eight kilometres) away, and a stone in the churchyard is said to have been part of the abbot's throne. A memorial in the church commemorates Bishop William Morgan, translator of the Bible into Welsh, who was the vicar from 1575 to 1579. The Mermaid Inn, 28 High Street, was very probably an early 16th-century merchant's house, placed on a burgage plot between the High Street and Alfred Jones Court. The timber-framed building has long storehouse or wing to the rear. The frontage was remodelled c. 1890, by Frank H. Shayler, architect, of Shrewsbury. Early illustrations of the building show that prior to this it had a thatched roof and that the timbering was not exposed. There is a passage to side with heavy box-framing in square panels, with brick infill exposed in side elevation and in rear wing. The frontage was exposed by Shayler to show decorative timber work on the upper storey. An Inn by the 19th century when it was owned by a family named Sparrow. There is an octagonal brick cockpit in New Street, which was built in the early 18th century and was in continual use for cockfighting until the practice was outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849. As of 2015, it is the home of the town's Women's Institute. Welshpool Town Hall, which was completed in 1874, is a Grade II listed building.    Transport  Welshpool railway station is on the Cambrian Line and is served by Transport for Wales.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

On 19 November 2010, he marked his 17th birthday by signing his first professional contract with the Reds. Suso made his first appearance for the first team in a pre-season friendly against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 1 August 2010, also playing in Jamie Carragher's testimonial match on 4 September. For competitive fixtures, however, he was immediately placed in the reserves, foregoing the Academy. In the 2010–11 season, he made the joint-highest number of appearances for the side with 17, and netted three goals as he adapted well to life on Merseyside. He followed this up with five goals in 17 games during the 2011–12 season, and he also made seven appearances in the NextGen Series.  On 20 September 2012, Suso made his senior Liverpool debut in a Europa League match against Young Boys, completing the full 90 minutes and earning a rave review from Brendan Rodgers. He made his Premier League debut three days later against Manchester United in a 2–1 defeat at Anfield, replacing the injured Fabio Borini at half-time. He performed impressively, completing all his passes despite Liverpool being a man down. He then played in the next game against West Bromwich Albion six days later in the League Cup, coming on with ten minutes to play and making an immediate impact by helping set up Nuri Şahin's second goal in a 2–1 win. He went on to make his first Premier League start on 29 September in a 5-2 win at Norwich City, where he assisted Luis Suárez's third goal. On 19 October 2012, Suso signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool, receiving praise from manager Brendan Rodgers for his \"maturity and commitment.\" On 18 December 2012, Suso was fined £10,000 for a remark he made to Liverpool teammate and compatriot José Enrique on Twitter, which The Football Association (FA) deemed homophobic. José Enrique replied to these charges, saying the remark was \"banter\" and \"just a joke.\" On 25 February 2013, after being shut-out of the first team due to the signings of Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho, Suso put in a poor performance for the under-21 team against Manchester United, which he acknowledged on his Twitter account, tweeting \"Sorry about tonight.. I was having some stomach problems during all game but i [sic] didn't want to come off of the game... Again sorry!\" The game finished 1–0 to United against a very strong Liverpool side that included Raheem Sterling, Andre Wisdom and Jonjo Shelvey.    Almería (loan)   On 12 July 2013, Suso joined La Liga side Almería on a season-long loan deal. He made his debut for the Andalusians on 19 August, assisting Rodri's goal in an eventual 2–3 home loss against Villarreal. In the following matchday, he also assisted Rodri in a 2–2 away draw against Getafe. On 21 September, Suso scored his first top flight goal in a 2–2 home draw against Levante. On 30 October, he helped his side end a wretched run of five successive defeats, assisting Marco Torsiglieri in a 2–1 away success over Valencia. On 2 November, Suso assisted Rodri by putting a cross into the six-yard box that was converted by the forward, who slid to meet the ball. It was the match's only goal (although highly-controversial) in a home win over Real Valladolid. Tomás Fernández Ruiz( born 1915, date of death unknown), was a Cuban footballer. == International career ==\nHe was born in Spain and represented Cuba at the 1938 FIFA World Cup in France, scoring a goal against Romania The Trail of the Lonesome Pine is a 1936 American adventure romance western film based on the 1908 novel of the same name. The picture was directed by Henry Hathaway starring Fred MacMurray, Sylvia Sidney and Henry Fonda. It was the second full-length feature film to be shot in three-strip Technicolor and the first in color to be shot outdoors, with the approval of the Technicolor Corporation. Much of it was shot at Big Bear Lake in southern California. The Trail of the Lonesome Pine was the fourth feature film adaptation of John Fox Jr.'s 1908 novel, including 1916 and 1923 silent versions.  As with the novel, the film makes extensive use of Appalachian English in the dialogue.    Plot  Deep in the region of the Eastern Kentucky Coalfield, a feud between the Kentucky clans of the Tollivers and the Falins has been ongoing for as long as anyone can recall. After an engineer, Jack Hale, arrives with coal and railroad interests, he saves the life of Dave Tolliver, whose injury has developed gangrene. Dave expects to marry a cousin, June, but she takes an immediate shine to the newcomer. Her younger brother Buddie is also impressed with Hale, who begins to educate him and take the boy under his wing. But others from both families do not give this outsider their trust. Upset over the budding romance, Dave sets out after Hale with a rifle but is ambushed by the Falins. The latest round of violence causes June not to want to return home, so Hale sends her to Louisville to live with his sister. A bridge is destroyed by the Falins, causing the accidental death of Buddie. A funeral is held and June returns, newly sophisticated from being in the big city. Family patriarch Buck Falin extends his apologies about her brother. Dave, however, is shot in the back by Wade Falin. The families agree that the feud has gone too far. Hale is befriended by all, and will happily marry June.    Cast  Fred MacMurray as Jack Hale Sylvia Sidney as June Tolliver Henry Fonda as Dave Tolliver Fred Stone as Judd Tolliver Nigel Bruce as Thurber Beulah Bondi as Melissa Robert Barrat as Buck Falin George \"Spanky\" McFarland as Buddie Tolliver Fuzzy Knight as Tater Otto Fries as Corsey Samuel S. Hinds as Sheriff Alan Baxter as Clay Tolliver Margaret Armstrong as Tolliver family member Ricca Allen as Tolliver family member Fern Emmett as Lena Tolliver    Production  With principal on-location photography beginning in mid-October 1935 in Chatsworth, at Big Bear Lake (in the San Bernardino Mountains), and at the Santa Susana Pass in California, recreating the rural and mountain locale of the novel. The film was the first feature-length film to be shot in three-strip Technicolor on location. Hathaway was borrowed from Paramount. In an interview with James Bawden in 1976, Fonda remembered carving “HF LUVS SS” on a tree during the production of this film. Director Henry Hathaway found it when shooting Woman Obsessed there in 1959. Considered a technological success, The Trail of the Lonesome Pine was not the first film to utilize the new color process but integrated its use successfully, and was a harbinger of future developments. \"The significance of this achievement is not to be minimized. It means that color need not shackle the cinema, but may give it fuller expression. It means that we can doubt no longer the inevitability of the color film or scoff at those who believe that black-and-white photography is tottering on the brink of that limbo of forgotten things which already has swallowed the silent picture.\"    Reception  The Trail of the Lonesome Pine received positive critical acclaim, with Frank Nugent of The New York Times considering the film significant yet not without flaws. \"Paramount's new film is far from perfect, either as a photoplay or as an instrument for the use of the new three-component Technicolor process\", although \"a cast of unusual merit and a richly beautiful color production\" were its redeeming qualities. Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a neutral review. While criticizing the use of Technicolor here as \"just bad bright picture-postcard stuff\", Greene praised the story as \"quite a good one\" and singled out Sylvia Sidney for her charming performance. The film made a profit of $522,620.    Awards and honors  Two original songs from the film, both written by composer Louis Alter and lyricist Sidney D. Mitchell and sung by Fuzzy Knight, gained national prominence. \"A Melody from the Sky\" was nominated for the 1937 Academy Award in the category of \"Best Music, Original Song\". John Fox Jr. (December 16, 1862 – July 8, 1919) was an American journalist, novelist, and short story writer.    Biography   Born in Stony Point, Kentucky, to John William Fox Sr. and Minerva Worth Carr, Fox studied English at Harvard University. He graduated in 1883 before becoming a reporter in New York City. After working for both New York Times and the New York Sun, he published a successful serialization of his first novel, A Mountain Europa, in Century magazine in 1892. Two moderately successful short story collections followed, as well as his first conventional novel, The Kentuckians in 1898. Fox gained a following as a war correspondent, working for Harper's Weekly in Cuba during the Spanish–American War of 1898, where he served with the \"Rough Riders.\" Six years later he traveled to Asia to report on the Russo-Japanese War for Scribner's magazine. Though he occasionally wrote for periodicals, after 1904, Fox dedicated much of his attention to fiction. The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (published in 1903) and The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (published in 1908) are arguably his most well known and successful works, entering the New York Times top ten list of bestselling novels for 1903, 1904, 1908, and 1909 respectively. In The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, the character Devil Judd Tolliver was based on the real life of \"Devil John\" Wesley Wright, the sheriff of Wise County, Virginia. Many of his works reflected the naturalist style, his childhood in Kentucky's Bluegrass region, and his life among the coal miners of Big Stone Gap, Virginia. Many of his novels were historical romances or period dramas set in that region. John Fox Jr. died in 1919 of pneumonia in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, and was buried in the family plot in Paris, Kentucky. His marriage to Austrian opera singer Fritzi Scheff in 1908 lasted just over four years. He had no children. The John Fox Jr. House in Big Stone Gap was turned into a museum after the death of John's sister in 1970. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

It has been adapted numerous times for both stage and screen.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\nSet in the Appalachian Mountains at the turn of the twentieth century, a feud has been boiling for over thirty years between two influential mountain families, the Tollivers and the Falins. The character of Devil Judd Tolliver in the novel was based on the real life of \"Devil John\" Wesley Wright, a United States Marshal for the region in and around Wise County, Virginia, and Letcher County, Kentucky.  The outside world and industrialization, however, are beginning to enter the area. Coal mining begins to exert its influence on the area, despite the two families' feuds. Entering the area, enterprising \"furriner\" (foreigner) geologist John Hale captures the attention of the beautiful June Tolliver, and inadvertently becomes entangled in the region's politics.\nGeologist Hale has a vision for the potential wealth of the natural raw materials, especially coal, that he intends to use as a means of creating a legacy for himself and the Gap.  But he also has an eye for the young natural beauty of a mountain girl, June Tolliver, whom he feels compelled to free from the confines of mountain life and introduce to higher education.\nThe coming boom time for the region requires Hale to establish authoritative law and order that the two feuding clans refuse to recognize.  It is this conflict between clans, who are used to settling their differences established by a century of tradition, and the principled Hale that threatens to destroy the budding romance between him and June, who then must choose between clan loyalties and the man she loves.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\nThe Trail of the Lonesome Pine was first adapted for the stage by Eugene Walter. The 1912 Broadway production starred Berton Churchill and Walter's wife, Charlotte Walker. An adaptation was filmed in 1914. In the 1916 film adaptation directed by Cecil B. DeMille, Charlotte Walker reprised her Broadway role, starring with Thomas Meighan. A 1923 film adaptation starring Mary Miles Minter and Antonio Moreno is considered a lost film.\nA 1936 motion picture was directed by Henry Hathaway. Starring Sylvia Sidney, Henry Fonda, and Fred MacMurray, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Louis Alter and Sidney D. Mitchell's \"A Melody From The Sky.\" It was also awarded the Venice Film Festival Award for Best Color Film. Hathaway's version marked the first time the Technicolor process was used for outdoor filmmaking.\nThe 1916 DeMille adaptation features an additional plot angle of Hale being a revenue agent seeking out \"moonshiners.\" It also omitted much of the subplot concerning the Falin family. Henry Hathaway's 1936 version, which was the first feature film to be filmed outdoors in full (three-strip) Technicolor, remains relatively faithful to the original novel.\nThe novel was adapted into a successful stage play by Earl Hobson Smith and Clara Lou Kelly. Since 1964, the play has been performed in an outdoor theater in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, the hometown of the novel's author. It is considered the longest running outdoor drama in the United States and was designated the \"official outdoor drama\" by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1994.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJune Tolliver House\n\"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\" (song)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n The Trail of the Lonesome Pine at Project Gutenberg\nOfficial Outdoor Stage Play Site\n The Trail of the Lonesome Pine public domain audiobook at LibriVox Javier Cámara Rodríguez (born 19 January 1967) is a Spanish actor.\nHe became known for two television roles as a priest in ¡Ay, señor, señor! and Éste es mi barrio.

Early life  Chambers was born in Brooklyn, New York, to William P. Chambers (1827–1911), a corporate and bankruptcy lawyer, and Caroline Smith Boughton (1842–1913). His parents met when his mother was twelve years old and William P. was interning with her father, Joseph Boughton, a prominent corporate lawyer. Eventually the two formed the law firm of Chambers and Boughton which continued to prosper even after Joseph's death in 1861. Robert Chambers's great-grandfather, William Chambers (birth unknown), a lieutenant in the British Royal Navy, was married to Amelia Saunders (1765–1822), a great granddaughter of Tobias Saunders of Westerly, Rhode Island. The couple moved from Westerly to Greenfield, Massachusetts and then to Galway, New York, where their son, also William Chambers (1798–1874), was born. The second William graduated from Union College at the age of 18, and then went to a college in Boston, where he studied medicine. Upon graduating, he and his wife, Eliza P. Allen (1793–1880), a direct descendant of Roger Williams, the founder of Providence, Rhode Island, were among the first settlers of Broadalbin, New York. His brother was the architect Walter Boughton Chambers. Chambers was first educated at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, and then entered the Art Students' League at around the age of twenty, where the artist Charles Dana Gibson was a fellow student. Chambers studied in Paris at the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Julian from 1886 to 1893, and his work was displayed at the Salon as early as 1889.     Career  On his return to New York, he succeeded in selling his illustrations to Life, Truth, and Vogue magazines. Then, for reasons unclear, he devoted his time to writing, producing his first novel, In the Quarter, written in 1887 in Munich. His most famous, and perhaps most meritorious, effort is The King in Yellow, a collection of Art Nouveau short stories published in 1895. This included several famous weird short stories which are connected by the theme of a fictitious drama of the same title, which drives those who read it insane. E. F. Bleiler described The King in Yellow as one of the most important works of American supernatural fiction. It was also strongly admired by H. P. Lovecraft and his circle. Chambers returned to the weird genre in his later short story collections The Maker of Moons, The Mystery of Choice and The Tree of Heaven, but none earned him as much success as The King in Yellow. Some of Chambers's work contains elements of science fiction, such as In Search of the Unknown and Police!!!, about a zoologist who encounters monsters. Chambers's main work of historical fiction was a series of novels set during the Franco-Prussian War. These novels were The Red Republic (1895, centring on the Paris Commune), Lorraine (1898),  Ashes of Empire (1898) and Maids of Paradise (1903). Chambers wrote Special Messenger (1909), Ailsa Paige (1910) and Whistling Cat (1932), novels set during the American Civil War. Chambers also wrote Cardigan (1901), a historical novel for younger readers, set at the outbreak of the American Revolution. Chambers later turned to writing romantic fiction to earn a living. According to some estimates, Chambers had one of the most successful literary careers of his period, his later novels selling well and a handful achieving best-seller status. Chambers' romance novels often featured intimate relationships between \"caddish\" men and sexually willing women, resulting in some reviewers accusing Chambers' works of promoting immorality. Many of his works were also serialised in magazines. His novel The Man They Hanged was about Captain Kidd, and argued that Kidd was not a pirate but had been made a scapegoat by the British government. During World War I, Chambers wrote war adventure novels and war stories, some of which showed a strong return to his old weird style, such as \"Marooned\" in Barbarians (1917). After 1924 he devoted himself solely to writing historical fiction. Chambers for several years made Broadalbin, New York, his summer home. Some of his novels touch upon colonial life in Broadalbin and Johnstown.    Personal life  On July 12, 1898, he married Elsa (Elsie) Vaughn Moller (1872–1939). Curly Ray Cline( January 10, 1923 – August 19, 1997) was an American bluegrass fiddler from West Virginia known for his work with the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers and Ralph Stanley.

Following a brief acting career in the late 1930s and early 1940s, he moved into film production; alongside Carlo Ponti, he brought Italian cinema to the international scene in the post-World War II period. He produced or co-produced over 500 films, with 38 of his Hollywood films receiving Academy Award nominations. He was also the creator and operator of DDL Foodshow, a chain of Italian specialty foods stores.    Early life  Agostino De Laurentiis was born in Torre Annunziata, Kingdom of Italy, on 8 August 1919. He grew up selling spaghetti made by his father's pasta factory. His older brother, Luigi De Laurentiis (1917–1992), later followed him into film production. He studied at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in 1937 and 1938, but his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.    Career     Film production  De Laurentiis produced his first film, L'ultimo Combattimento, in 1941. His company, the Dino de Laurentiis Cinematografica, moved into film production in 1946. In the early years, De Laurentiis produced Italian neorealist films such as Bitter Rice (1949) and the early Fellini works La Strada (1954) and Nights of Cabiria (1956), often in collaboration with producer Carlo Ponti.  In the 1960s, De Laurentiis built his own studio facilities. He produced such films as Barabbas (1961), a Christian religious epic; The Bible: In the Beginning... (1966); Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die, an imitation James Bond film; Navajo Joe (1966), a spaghetti Western; Anzio (1968), a World War II film; Barbarella (1968) and Danger: Diabolik (1968), both successful comic book adaptations; and The Valachi Papers (1972), released before its originally scheduled date in order to capitalize on the popularity of The Godfather.  In 1973, De Laurentiis relocated his headquarters to New York and he was reportedly considering to produce an American television series. His studio financially collapsed during the 1970s. In the 1980s, he had his own studio: De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG) based in Wilmington, North Carolina. The studio made Wilmington an unexpected center of film and television production. In 1990, he obtained backing from an Italian friend and formed another company: Dino De Laurentiis Communications in Beverly Hills. De Laurentiis produced a number of successful films, including The Scientific Cardplayer (1972), Serpico (1973), Death Wish (1974), Mandingo (1975), Three Days of the Condor (1975), The Shootist (1976), Drum (1976), Ingmar Bergman's The Serpent's Egg (1977), Ragtime (1981), Conan the Barbarian (1982), Blue Velvet (1986) and Breakdown (1997). De Laurentiis' name became well known through the 1976 King Kong remake, which was a commercial hit; Lipstick (1976), a rape and revenge drama; Orca (1977), a killer whale film; The White Buffalo (1977), a western; the disaster movie Hurricane (1979); the remake of Flash Gordon (1980);  David Lynch's Dune (1984); The Bounty (1984); and King Kong Lives (1986).  De Laurentiis produced several adaptations of Stephen King works, including The Dead Zone (1983), Cat's Eye (1985), Silver Bullet (1985), and Maximum Overdrive (1986). De Laurentiis' company was involved with the horror sequels Halloween II (1981), Evil Dead II (1987), and Army of Darkness (1992). De Laurentiis also produced the first Hannibal Lecter film, Manhunter (1986), an adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel Red Dragon. He passed on adapting the novels' sequel, The Silence of the Lambs (1991), but produced the two follow-ups, Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002), a re-adaptation of the novel. He also produced the prequel Hannibal Rising (2007), which tells the story of how Hannibal becomes a serial killer.    DDL Foodshow  DDL Foodshow was an Italian specialty foods store with three locations: two in New York City and one in Beverly Hills. In Our Time is a 1944 American romantic drama film set in the days leading up to World War II. It stars Ida Lupino and Paul Henreid.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn March 1939, English antiques dealer Mrs. Bromley and her assistant Jennifer \"Jenny\" Whittredge travel through Poland making purchases. In Warsaw, Jenny meets Count Stefan Orwid and, after a whirlwind courtship, he asks her to marry him.\nHowever, Stefan's aristocratic family, particularly his sister Janina and his wealthy, diplomat uncle Count Pawel Orwid, is less than welcoming to the English commoner. His mother Zofyia merely wants to keep peace in the family. Only his other uncle, the ineffectual Leopold Baruta, welcomes her. Nonetheless, the wedding takes place.\nAfterwards, Jenny encourages Stefan to break his family's dependence on Count Pawel's financial aid by persuading his peasant tenants to adopt more modern and efficient farming methods. It works; the harvest is bountiful, and Stefan accepts Jenny's suggestion that they invite the workers to a celebration party in his mansion. Count Pawel makes a surprise visit to express his strong disapproval of Jenny's democratic ideas. However, they are interrupted by the bombing of nearby Warsaw. War has broken out, despite Count Pawel's desperate attempts to placate Nazi Germany.\nStefan joins his Polish Army cavalry regiment, leaving Jenny to supervise the rest of the harvest. Days go by with conflicting radio reports. Finally, a dazed, wounded Stefan returns to the estate. His regiment was wiped out after charging tanks. He gathers the peasants and asks them to burn the crop and anything else that could be of use to the invaders. They patriotically agree. Count Pawel shows up to take the family to Romania. Stefan, Jenny, and Leopold remain behind to fight.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nIda Lupino as Jennifer Whittredge\nPaul Henreid as Count Stefan Orwid\nNancy Coleman as Janina Orwid\nMary Boland as Mrs. Bromley\nVictor Francen as Count Pawel Orwid\nAlla Nazimova as Zofia Orwid (as Nazimova)\nMichael Chekhov as Uncle Leopold Baruta\nCyd Charisse as Ballerina\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe movie presents a vision of Poland before and during the September 1939 campaign that was a propagandistic assault on the country. Mieczysław B. Biskupski describes it as a \"piece of historical rubbish\", which claims that despite everything the West had done, the war is essentially Poland's fault. The country is presented as being based on \"meaningless symbols based on a distant past\" with questionable patriotism; serfdom is still present (in reality, it was abolished in the 19th century), and the majority of Poles are depicted as pro-German, pro-Nazi, and sinister. The film also follows the myth that Polish cavalry had conducted charges on German tanks.\nIn the first versions of script, the opening montage was to present a map of the Poland from 16th century, which then would be burned down; afterwards, the map with the Second Polish Republic was planned to appear. In Biskupski's words, this was supposed to show that the previous downfall of Poland was solely the fault of the Polish nation, while carefully omitting Russia's role.\nThere are also doubts about the crew. Screewriter Howard Koch had close ties with CPSU, and was probably its member in the 1930s. Director Vincent Sherman claimed that he had read about Polish history, but described it as the \"South before the Civil War\", thinking that peasants were supporting the landed gentry and large estates. Biskupski also notes, that the Daily Worker praised the movie, calling all the forces loyal to the Polish government-in-exile \"reactionary\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1944\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIn Our Time at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nIn Our Time at IMDb\nIn Our Time at the TCM Movie Database\nIn Our Time at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films Clara Calamai (7 September 1915 – 21 September 1998) was an Italian actress.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCalamai was born in Prato, Tuscany, on 7 September 1915.\nCalamai's first acting role was in the 1938 war film Pietro Micca, directed by Aldo Vergano.\nIn Alessandro Blasetti's The Jester's Supper (1942), Calamai briefly appeared topless in a scene. The scene is commonly credited with being the first time that an actress had appeared topless in an Italian sound film, although Vittoria Carpi showed a bare breast for a moment in the 1941 film La corona di ferro (The Iron Crown), which was also directed by Blasetti. Calamai stated in a later interview that the original script did not have the character revealing herself this way and did not want to do the scene, but felt compelled by the director to do it and gave in when she was promised a closed set.\nHer most remembered role was in the film Luchino Visconti's Ossessione (1943), in which she played Giovanna, the ill-fated female protagonist.\nCalamai was offered the lead role in L'adultera (The Adulteress, 1946, directed by Duilio Coletti), after Anna Magnani, originally cast in the part, \"was visibly five months' pregnant when she arrived on the set.\" Calamai was awarded the Nastro d'Argento (Silver Ribbon) in 1946 for best actress for her performance in the film.\nShe played a prostitute in Luchino Visconti's Le notti bianche (1957) and appeared in Le streghe (1967).\nAfter years of retirement, she returned in 1975 to appear in the  horror film Profondo rosso (Deep Red, directed by  Dario Argento) as the eccentric matriarch, Marta.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn 19 May 1945 she married explorer, and documentary film maker Count Leonardo Bonzi with whom she had two daughters. The marriage was annulled in November 1959, and she lived with Captain of Aviation Valerio Andreoni.\nCalamai died in Rimini on 21 September 1998. Calamai is buried in the Monumental Cemetery of Rimini. In September 2022, a stele dedicated to her was unveiled in the cemetery behind the funerary monument of Federico Fellini.\n\n\n== Partial filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nClara Calamai at IMDb Gian Maria Volonté (9 April 1933 – 6 December 1994) was an Italian actor and activist. He is best known for his roles in four Spaghetti Western films: Ramón Rojo in Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (1964), El Indio in Leone's For a Few Dollars More (1965), El Chuncho Munoz in Damiano Damiani's A Bullet for the General (1966) and Professor Brad Fletcher in Sergio Sollima's Face to Face (1967). He had notable roles in high-profile social dramas depicting the political and social stirrings of Italian and European society in the 1960s and 1970s, including four films directed by Elio Petri – We Still Kill the Old Way (1967), Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion (1970), The Working Class Goes to Heaven (1971), and Todo modo (1976). He is also recognized for dozens of his performances. It suffice to say that he had the leading role in the two italian movies that were awarded ex-aequo Palme d'or at 1972 Cannes Film Festival, and he received \"only\" a \"special mention\" from Jury, not to transform that Festival into a private Italian contest. Among other accolades, Volonté won two David di Donatello Awards and three Nastro d'Argento Awards. He won the Best Actor Award at the 36th Cannes Film Festival for The Death of Mario Ricci (1983), and the Silver Bear at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival for The Moro Affair (1986). Director Francisco Rosi said that he \"stole the soul of his characters\".    Early life  Volonté was born in Milan, but grew up in Turin. His father Mario was a fascist officer from Saronno (province of Varese), who in 1944 was in command of the Brigata Nera of Chivasso, near Turin. His mother, Carolina Bianchi, belonged to a wealthy Milanese industrial family, and his younger brother Claudio was an actor as well. He went to Rome to train for an acting career at the Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D'Amico, obtaining a degree in 1957.     Career  Volonté made his debut in 1960 in Sotto dieci bandiere, directed by Duilio Coletti. Just four years later, he played \"Ramón Rojo\" in A Fistful of Dollars (1964), and \"El Indio\" in For a Few Dollars More (1965), both for cash reasons as he considered the two films to be generic exploitation entertainment and was more interested in projects with a political message. Both films were directed by the then-unknown Sergio Leone, and Volonté's roles in them would bring him his greatest recognition from American audiences. He played Carlo Levi in Christ Stopped at Eboli (1979), which was based on Levi's autobiographical account of his years in internal exile in Aliano, Southern Italy, in the 1930s. Volonté played the memorable role of the Bandito-turned-guerrilla, El Chuncho, in A Bullet for the General (1966).  Volonté's performances as memorable but neurotic characters, or as a gifted leader of brigands or revolutionaries, together with the unexpected, worldwide success of the films, gave him international fame. Volonté had already played comedies, including A cavallo della tigre (1961) by Luigi Comencini, and confirmed his versatility in L'armata Brancaleone (1966). However, he found his main dimension in dramatic roles for Banditi a Milano (1968), by Carlo Lizzani, Sbatti il mostro in prima pagina (1972) by Marco Bellocchio, La Classe operaia va in paradiso (1972) by his friend Elio Petri, and Il sospetto (1975) by Francesco Maselli.  In 1968, Volonté won a Silver Ribbon as best actor for A ciascuno il suo, also directed by Elio Petri. Volonté received the same award for two other performances: Petri's Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto (1971, winner of an Academy Award as best foreign film), considered by many to be his finest; and in The Abyss (1989). In 1983 he won the award for Best Actor at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival for La Mort de Mario Ricci. Four years later, at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival, he won the Silver Bear for Best Actor for Il caso Moro. In 1988 Volonté starred in the  Cannes Film Festival Official Selection, The Abyss, as a physician-alchemist. The Piano is a 1993 historical drama film written and directed by Jane Campion. It stars Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel, Sam Neill, and Anna Paquin in her first major acting role. The film focuses on a mute Scottish woman who travels to a remote part of New Zealand with her young daughter after her arranged marriage to a frontiersman. A co-production between New Zealand, Australia, and France, The Piano was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$140.2 million worldwide (equivalent to $295.7 million in 2023) against its US$7 million budget (equivalent to $14.8 million in 2023). It was noted for its crossover appeal beyond the arthouse circuit to attracting mainstream popularity, largely due to rave reviews and word of mouth. Hunter and Paquin both received high praise for their performances. In 1993, the film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, making Campion the first female director to receive the award. It won three Academy Awards out of eight total nominations in March 1994: Best Actress for Hunter, Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, and Best Original Screenplay for Campion. Paquin was 11 years old at the time and remains the second-youngest actor to win an Oscar in a competitive category. The plot has similarities to Jane Mander's 1920 novel, The Story of a New Zealand River, but also substantial differences. Campion has cited the novels Wuthering Heights and The African Queen as inspirations.    Plot  In the mid-1800s, a Scotswoman named Ada McGrath who chooses not to speak is sold by her father into marriage with New Zealand frontiersman Alisdair Stewart, along with her daughter Flora. Ada has not spoken since the age of six, and the reason for this as well as the identity of Flora's father remain unknown. She communicates through playing the piano and sign language, with Flora acting as her interpreter. Ada and Flora, along with their handcrafted piano, are stranded on a New Zealand beach by a ship's crew. The next day, Alisdair arrives with his Māori crew and neighbour George Baines, a retired sailor who's adapted to Maori customs, including facial tattoos. Alisdair tells Ada that they don't have enough bearers for the piano and then refuses to go back for it, claiming that they all need to make sacrifices. Desperate to retrieve her piano, Ada seeks George's help. Although he can't read her note, he is entranced by her music and agrees to help her. George offers Alisdair the land he's been coveting in exchange for the piano and Ada's lessons. Alisdair agrees, oblivious to George's attraction to Ada. Ada is enraged by George's proposition but agrees to trade lessons for piano keys. She restricts the lessons to the black keys only and resists George's demands for more intimacy. Ada continues to rebuff Alisdair's advances while exploring her sensuality with George. George eventually realizes that Ada will never commit to him emotionally and returns the piano to her, confessing that he wants Ada to care for him genuinely. Although Ada has her piano back, she longs for George and returns to him. Alisdair overhears them having sex and watches them through a crack in the wall. Furious, he confronts Ada and tries to force himself on her despite her strong resistance. He then coerces Ada into promising she will no longer see George. Shortly after, Ada instructs Flora to deliver a package to George, which contains a piano key with a love declaration engraved on it. Flora delivers it to Alisdair instead. Enraged after reading the message, Alisdair cuts off Ada's index finger, depriving her of the ability to play the piano. He sends Flora to George with the severed finger, warning him to stay away from Ada or he will chop off more fingers. Later, while touching Ada as she sleeps, Alisdair hears what he thinks is her voice in his head, asking him to let George take her away. He goes to George's house and asks if Ada has ever spoken to him, but George says no. George and Ada leave together with her belongings and piano tied onto a Māori longboat. As they row to the ship, Ada asks George to throw the piano overboard. She allows her leg to be caught by the rope attached to the piano and is dragged underwater with it in an attempt to drown herself. As she sinks, she appears to change her mind and struggles free before being pulled to safety. In the epilogue, Ada describes her new life with George and Flora in Nelson, New Zealand, where she gives piano lessons in their new home. George has made her a metal finger to replace the one she lost, and Ada has been practicing and taking speech lessons.

The Damned Don't Cry is a 1950 American film noir crime-drama directed by Vincent Sherman and featuring Joan Crawford, David Brian, and Steve Cochran. It tells of a woman's involvement with an organized crime boss and his subordinates. The screenplay by Harold Medford and Jerome Weidman was based on the story \"Case History\" by Gertrude Walker. The plot is loosely based on the relationship of Bugsy Siegel and Virginia Hill. The film was directed by Vincent Sherman and produced by Jerry Wald. The Damned Don't Cry is the first of three cinematic collaborations between Sherman and Crawford, the others being Harriet Craig (1950) and Goodbye, My Fancy (1951).    Plot  Ethel Whitehead, a married woman living in a squalid factory town with an abusive husband and unsupportive parents, is only attached to her young son. After he dies in a tragic accident, she abandons her marriage and leaves town, determined to discover a worthwhile life at any cost. With no education or work experience, she works at a low-wage job until she attracts the attention of a customer, who invites her to model dresses at his department store. Before long, she finds herself shedding her morals to become an escort for wealthy clients on the side.  Ethel meets the store's mild-mannered accountant, Martin Blackford, who accepts her invitation to dine out with herat the club where she usually entertains out-of-town clients. After learning that Martin's financial situation is hardly better than her own, she engineers a meeting between the club's boss, Grady, who badly needs a competent accountant. Needing the money, Martin reluctantly takes the extra work.  As Martin's friendship with Ethel deepens and his reputation grows, Ethel manages to ingratiate him further into the criminal underworld by encouraging him to join in with a casino gambling plot masterminded by George Castleman, an organized crime boss and former smalltime crook. The honest Martin initially balks at the idea of aiding a criminal enterprise, but Ethel encourages him to likewise abandon his morals, arguing that money and power are the only things that matters in life, and that all people must look after themselves. In order to please Ethel, Martin agrees, and the two share a kiss. However, Ethel and Castleman share a mutual attraction based on a shared ambition to claw their way to the top, and she reciprocates his advances when meeting with him to discuss Martin's pay. With Martin's assistance, Castleman's plans flourish, but he faces difficulties with Nick Prenta, an underling who he had sent west in order to be rid of him, but who found success and is rumored to be planning a rebellion following the murder of Grady. Castleman orders Ethel to join Nick and uncover his plans. Ethel (now going by Lorna Hansen Forbes, a glamorous socialite cover invented by Castleman) obeys his command out of love for him. Ethel successfully seduces Nick Prenta, but falls in love with him after learning of his circumstances and becoming sympathetic. She chafes under her responsibility after a meeting with Martin informs her that a vindictive Castleman intends to murder Nick if his suspicions about a rebellion are true. Ethel, disillusioned with Castleman, reluctantly attends one of Nick's meetings and learns the names of the associates who intend to support his double-cross. However, she is unable to conceal the information, as Castleman ambushes her at home and accuses her of falling in love with Nick. He confronts Nick and reveals than Ethel was nothing more than a mole before shooting him dead. Ethel flees back home to her parents, but Martin soon locates her; he admitted that Castleman murdered Nick to the police, and warns her that Castleman also knows of her location and intends to kill her as well. Before Ethel can escape, Castleman arrives and attempts to kill Martin. Ethel wrestles for the gun and is shot, while Martin manages to kill Castleman. Ethel, wounded but alive, convalesces in bed as two reporters predict that she'll try once more to make it out of her roughshod hometown once she recovers.    Cast   Uncredited (in order of appearance)    Reception     Box office  The movie was a hit. According to Warner Bros., it earned $1,540,000 in the U.S. and $671,000 in other markets. According to Variety, the film earned $1.4 million in the U.S. and Canada in 1950.    Critical response  When the film was released, the reviews were mixed, even though the box office was considered good. The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther was tough on the film in his review. Carlo Fortunato Pietro Ponti Sr. OMRI (11 December 1912 – 10 January 2007) was an Italian film producer with more than 140 productions to his credit. Along with Dino De Laurentiis, he is credited with reinvigorating  and popularizing Italian cinema post-World War II, producing some of the country's most acclaimed and financially-successful films of the 1950s and 1960s. Ponti worked with many of the most important directors of Italian cinema of the era, including Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Vittorio De Sica, as well as many international directors such as Agnès Varda and David Lean. He helped launch the career of his wife, international film star Sophia Loren. He won the Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film for La Strada (1954) and was nominated for Best Picture for producing Doctor Zhivago (1965). In 1996, he was appointed as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.    Early life  Ponti was born in Magenta, Lombardy, where his grandfather had been mayor of the city. Ponti studied law at the University of Milan. He joined his father's law firm in Milan and became involved in the film business through negotiating contracts.    Career     Early films  Ponti attempted to establish a film industry in Milan in 1940 and produced Mario Soldati's Piccolo mondo antico there, starring Alida Valli, in her first notable role. The film dealt with the Italian struggle against the Austrians for the inclusion of northeastern Italy into the Kingdom of Italy during the Risorgimento. The film was successful, because it was easy to see \"the Austrians as Germans\" during World War II.  As a result, Ponti was briefly jailed for undermining relations with Nazi Germany. Ponti accepted an offer from Riccardo Gualino's Lux Film in Rome in 1941. He made Giacomo the Idealist (1943), A Yank in Rome (1946), To Live in Peace (1947), The White Primrose (1948), Prelude to Madness (1948) and Hey Boy (1948). Ponti produced some films starring Gina Lollobrigida: Alarm Bells (1949), The White Line (1950), A Dog's Life (1950). Her Favourite Husband (1950) was a British-Italian co production with Jean Kent.  He made a number of comedies including Figaro Here, Figaro There (1950), Toto the Third Man (1951) and Toto in Color (1952), with Totò, plus The Knight Has Arrived! (1951), The Piano Tuner Has Arrived (1952) and The Steamship Owner (1951) with Walter Chiari. Ponti alternated this with more serious material such as Europe '51 (1952) from Roberto Rossellini, Brothers of Italy (1952), Lieutenant Giorgio (1953), and Easy Years (1953). The Unfaithfuls (1953) reunited Ponti with Lollobrigida, while Neapolitan Carousel (1954) won the International Prize at Cannes.    International breakthrough and Sophia Loren  In 1954 Ponti had his greatest artistic success with the production of Federico Fellini's La strada. However, Fellini denied Ponti's role in its success and said that \"La Strada was made in spite of Ponti and De Laurentiis\".  Along with a Toto comedy The Doctor of the Mad (1954) he and de Laurentiis produced an international film, Mambo (1954) directed by Robert Rossen. There was An American in Rome (1955) with Alberto Sordi and The Gold of Naples (1954) with a young Sophia Loren. Loren was the female lead in Ponti's Attila (1954), a biopic of Attila the Hun with Anthony Quinn that became a big box office success. Loren was in The Miller's Beautiful Wife (1955), a comedy. Ponti and de Laurentiis made the epic war film War and Peace (1956). In June 1956 his partnership with De Laurentiis ended after more than eighty films over six years. Ponti continued to produce smaller movies for the Italian market such as The Railroad Man (1956), and Guendalina (1957), but his focus was increasingly on bigger budgeted films aimed at the international Market starring Loren: The Black Orchid (1959) with Anthony Quinn, That Kind of Woman (1959) with Tab Hunter, Heller in Pink Tights (1960) with Quinn again, A Breath of Scandal (1960) with John Gavin.

The Hard Way is a 1943 Warner Bros. musical drama film  starring Ida Lupino, Dennis Morgan, and Joan Leslie. Directed by Vincent Sherman, it is based on a story by Irwin Shaw which was reportedly based on Ginger Rogers' relationship with her first husband Jack Pepper (whom she married in 1928 at age 17) and her mother Lela.    Plot  Helen Chernen (Ida Lupino) is an ambitious woman, determined to escape poverty in a dirty steel town. She pushes her younger sister Katie (Joan Leslie) into a marriage with singer/dancer Albert Runkel (Jack Carson). Katie has no interest in the man, but she is desperate for a better life. Runkel's partner Paul Collins (Dennis Morgan) realizes Helen's deeper intentions and tries to stop her from breaking Runkel's heart. Once risen into wealthier surroundings, Helen tries to make a start on Katie's career. After showcasing her in Runkel's act, she is able to put her in a Broadway production. Katie soon becomes a successful singer and actress, and Collins and Runkel's act flounders. Runkel can't bear being away from his wife on tour and refuses to live off her earnings or even use his wife's name to promote himself. He eventually commits suicide.    Meanwhile, Katie's popularity goes to her head, and she becomes a wild party girl, losing an important opportunity. She later meets with Paul, who is now a successful band leader. He falls in love with her, and they start a relationship. However, Katie is forced to choose between him and appearing in playwright Laura Britton's play. She chooses the play over Paul, who has asked her to marry him, and he leaves. Before the play, Paul comes to see Katie to wish her luck, but Helen runs him off and the sisters fight over the motivation for Katie's success. During the play, Katie forgets lines and has to be cued several times before collapsing in the middle of the production. Later that evening, after recovering, Katie tells Helen that she never wants to see her again. Paul appears, and the two profess their love for each other. Helen later dies in what is implied to be a suicide.     Cast  Ida Lupino as Mrs. Helen Chernen Joan Leslie as 'Katie' Blaine Dennis Morgan as Paul Collins Jack Carson as Albert Runkel Gladys George as Lily Emery Faye Emerson as Ice Cream Parlor Waitress Paul Cavanagh as John \"Jack\" Shagrue Dolores Moran as Young Blonde (uncredited) Emory Parnell as Policeman (uncredited) Leona Maricle as Laura Britton (uncredited)    Production  Both Bette Davis and Ginger Rogers initially were offered the role of Helen, but both declined. Ida Lupino was cast. Irwin Shaw wanted Howard Hawks or William Wyler to direct the film, but because they were busy with other projects, producer Jerry Wald hired Vincent Sherman.  Portions of a documentary film by Pare Lorentz were used to represent the mining town of Green Hill. To achieve a more realistic feel during the scenes that took place in Green Hill, neither Lupino nor Leslie wore makeup.  The film's first and last scenes were added at Jack L. Warner's insistence, who also demanded that Lupino appear more glamorous in the film’s opening.

Operation Crossbow (later re-released as The Great Spy Mission) is a 1965 British espionage thriller set during the Second World War. This movie concerns an actual series of events where British undercover operatives targeted the German manufacturing facilities for experimental rocket-bombs.  The film was directed by Michael Anderson and stars Sophia Loren, George Peppard, Trevor Howard, John Mills, Richard Johnson, and Tom Courtenay. The screenplay was written by Emeric Pressburger (under the pseudonym \"Richard Imrie\"), in collaboration with Derry Quinn and Ray Rigby, from a story by Duilio Coletti and Vittoriano Petrilli. It was filmed in Panavision and Metrocolor at MGM-British Studios. Although it is largely fictional, the movie does touch on the main aspects of the operation, which was geared to thwart the German long-range weapons programme in the final years of World War II. The story alternates between Nazi Germany's development of the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket, and the efforts of British Intelligence and its agents to counter those threats. All characters speak in the appropriate language, with English subtitles for those speaking German or Dutch.    Plot  In 1943, Nazi Germany is developing the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket. Technical issues with the V-1 lead the Germans to create a crewed version for flight testing, but the test pilots die flying it. Eventually, aviator Hanna Reitsch successfully flies the prototype, and realises that mechanical shifting of the missile's weight and change of speed requires the trim controls to be changed. Winston Churchill is concerned about a rumoured flying bomb and orders Duncan Sandys, his son-in-law and a minister, to investigate. Sandys is convinced by intelligence and photo-reconnaissance reports that they exist, but scientific advisor Professor  Lindemann dismisses the reports. Bomber Command launches a raid on Peenemünde to destroy the rocket complex. The Germans move production underground to the Mittelwerk in Southern Germany and progress to develop the more deadly V-2 rocket. The head of British intelligence learns that engineers are being recruited across occupied Europe and decides to infiltrate the factory. He finds three volunteers, American, Dutch, and British, all experienced engineers who speak fluent German or Dutch. They are hastily trained and sent to Germany. Amongst the volunteers interviewed but not selected is a British officer named Bamford, who is later revealed as a German undercover agent. After the agents parachute into occupied Europe, the British learn that one of them, Robert Henshaw, has been given the identity of a Dutch sailor who is wanted by German police for murder. He is arrested but agrees to act as an informer for the Germans. However, he is recognised by Bamford, who has returned to Germany. Refusing to reveal his mission, Henshaw is shot after refusing to co-operate.  Nora, the wife of the man whom USAAF Lieutenant John Curtis is impersonating, visits the hotel where she believes her husband is staying, to obtain full custody of their children. After Curtis gains her silence with a promise to free her and leaves for the factory, Nora is killed by another agent. Curtis and Phil Bradley infiltrate the underground rocket factory. Bradley is assigned as a porter/cleaner while his papers are checked. Curtis joins the heart of the project, assigned to fix the vibration that is delaying the V-2's development. V-1 flying bombs are shown being launched from their 'ski' ramps and falling on London, while others are destroyed by anti-aircraft fire, after defensive guns are moved forward to the Kent coast. The more devastating V-2 attacks begin. Launched from undetectable mobile platforms, the only way to fight them is to destroy the factory. The agents learn that the Royal Air Force is mounting a night-time bombing raid, but the launch doors covering the large A9/A10 \"New York rocket\" must be opened so that the light provides a visible target. Bradley tries to discover which powerhouse switch opens the doors. Bamford arrives and reviews the photos of the engineering staff, searching for a familiar face. He recognises no-one, and orders all employee records to be checked. The face of the man Curtis is impersonating does not match that taken at the factory, and Bamford realises Curtis is a spy. He sounds the alarm just as the agents are heading for the powerhouse. Bradley is captured, but Curtis, who does not know which switch to pull, makes his way inside, sealing himself in, while holding the staff hostage.  Bamford demands that Curtis surrender, using Bradley as his bargaining chip. As the air raid sirens sound, Bradley lunges for the microphone and tells Curtis which switch to pull, and is shot by Bamford. The powerhouse workers attack Curtis, but he shoots them. One shoots Curtis as he pulls the lever, opening the launch doors. Barbara Rush (January 4, 1927 – March 31, 2024) was an American actress.

Ribot was a member of The Lounge Lizards for several years in the late 1980s. Band leader John Lurie later wrote: \"Marc is a musical genius. So many ideas are coming out of that guy that it is actually often a problem.\" Ribot's earliest work as a session musician was featured on Tom Waits's Rain Dogs (1985) and helped define Waits's new musical direction. Ribot worked with Waits on many of his following albums including Franks Wild Years (1987), Big Time (1988), Mule Variations (1999), Real Gone (2004), Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards (2006) and Bad as Me (2011).

Ribot's first two albums featured the Rootless Cosmopolitans, followed by an album of works by Frantz Casseus for solo guitar.  Further releases found him working in a variety of band and solo contexts including two albums with his self-described \"dance band\", Marc Ribot y Los Cubanos Postizos (Prosthetic Cubans), featuring compositions by Arsenio Rodríguez. Ribot admitted to Guitar Player a relatively limited technical facility due to learning to play right-handed despite being left-handed: \"That's a real limit, one that caused me a lot of grief when I was working with Jack McDuff and realising I wasn't following in George Benson's footsteps. I couldn't be a straight-ahead jazz contender if you held a gun to my head.\" He currently performs and records with his groups Marc Ribot's Ceramic Dog with bassist Shahzad Ismaily and drummer Ches Smith of the avant-garde band Secret Chiefs 3, Marc Ribot Trio with bassist Henry Grimes and drummer Chad Taylor of Chicago Underground, Marc Ribot y Los Cubanos Postizos with Horacio “El Negro” Hernandez on drums and original members pianist Anthony Coleman, bassist Brad Jones and percussionist EJ Rodriquez, and The Young Philadelphians, covering 1970s Philadelphia soul music with  Philadelphia-based musicians bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma and drummer G.

The Young Philadelphians is a 1959 American legal drama film directed by Vincent Sherman and starring Paul Newman, Barbara Rush, Robert Vaughn and Alexis Smith. The film is based on the 1956 novel The Philadelphian, by Richard P. Powell.    Plot  It is 1924. Newlywed Kate Judson Lawrence is distraught to discover on her wedding night that her upper-class Philadelphia Main Line husband, William never really wanted to marry her, when he says, \"It was my mother who wanted this marriage, to give her a grandson. But I can't love you, Kate, I can't love anyone.\" After William leaves her that night, she seeks comfort from longtime working-class friend and former beau Mike Flanagan. The next day, Kate learns that William died of an apparent suicide in a car wreck. Nine months later, Kate gives birth to a son, Anthony Judson \"Tony\" Lawrence. She is visited by William's mother, who has become aware that Flanagan was Tony's father. She offers money to Kate if she will not raise her son as a Lawrence, but she refuses, and is cut off from the family money. Years later, Tony is a smart, ambitious Princeton University student working his way through college for Flanagan as a construction worker, aiming to become a lawyer. One day, he encounters socialite Joan Dickinson when she has a minor car accident. They soon fall in love, though Joan is expected by nearly everyone in her lofty social circle to marry millionaire Carter Henry. Their mutual friend, Chester \"Chet\" Gwynn, warns her not to let social pressure separate her from the one she loves as it did him. They decide to elope. However, Joan's father Gilbert Dickinson  persuades Tony to postpone the wedding by offering him invaluable career help and a job at the highly esteemed law firm of which he is a full partner. Believing Tony has allowed himself to be bought, a disillusioned Joan sails to Europe. When Carter follows her, she marries him. Devastated and angry, Tony realizes that Joan's father wanted her to marry into another wealthy family, and only offered Tony help with his career in the hope of breaking them up. Tony then devotes himself to working his way up the social ladder and learning the game of the wealthy. Fellow student Louis Donetti tells Tony about a wonderful opportunity he has to assist John Marshall Wharton in writing a law book. Tony becomes acquainted with Wharton's much younger wife Carol and steals the job from his classmate. Living and working at Wharton's mansion, Tony impresses his employer with his expertise. Carol becomes attracted to him. She comes to his bedroom one night, but he cunningly defuses the dangerous situation by asking her to divorce her husband and marry him, knowing that she will be unwilling to do that. Wharton offers Tony a job at his own prestigious firm. Tony accepts, deciding to specialize in the relatively new area of tax law, where there is more opportunity for rapid advancement. When the Korean War starts, interrupting his career, Tony serves as a JAG officer. Others are not as fortunate. Chet Gwynn loses an arm in combat, and Carter Henry is killed, leaving Joan a widow. Upon returning home, Tony gets a lucky break. Forced to work over the Christmas holiday, he is available when the very rich Mrs. J. Arthur Allen needs her will amended. With his specialized knowledge, he shows her how to avoid paying a great deal of taxes. Mrs. Allen responds by designating Tony to manage her finances, instead of her longtime lawyer Gilbert Dickinson. Tony also begins mending his relationship with Joan. Success after success follows, and Tony becomes well known and respected by the Philadelphia elite. One night, Tony is called to the police station to pick up Chet, his disheveled, drunken friend. Donetti (now a public prosecutor) has Chet taken into custody and charged with the first-degree murder of Morton Stearnes, Chet's uncle and tight-fisted guardian of his inheritance. Chet insists on Tony defending him, fearing that his relatives, particularly family patriarch Dr. Shippen Stearnes are more interested in avoiding a scandal than proving his innocence. Despite having no experience with criminal law, Tony reluctantly agrees. His work is further complicated when Shippen Stearnes threatens to reveal that Tony's real father is Mike Flanagan if Tony embarrasses the Stearnes clan. When Joan offers to hire a reliable attorney, Tony realizes that she fears that he has sold out once again. At the trial, Tony discredits the testimony of Morton Stearnes' butler. He gets Shippen to admit that Morton had a brain tumor and was mentally depressed, and that he might have committed suicide. The jury finds Chet not guilty.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Pola X is a 1999 French romantic drama film directed by Leos Carax and starring Guillaume Depardieu, Yekaterina Golubeva and Catherine Deneuve. The film is loosely based on the Herman Melville novel .

Pola X is a 1999 French drama film directed by Leos Carax and starring Guillaume Depardieu, Yekaterina Golubeva and Catherine Deneuve. The film is loosely based on the Herman Melville novel Pierre: or, The Ambiguities. It revolves around a young novelist who is confronted by a woman who claims to be his lost sister, and the two begin a romantic relationship. The film title is an acronym of the French title of the novel, Pierre ou les ambiguïtés, plus the Roman numeral \"X\" indicating the tenth draft version of the script that was used to make the film. The film was entered into the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Pola X has been associated by some with the New French Extremity.    Plot  Pierre lives a carefree life with his widowed mother in a Normandy chateau, enjoying rising fame as a pseudonymous author. He also visits Lucie, his fiancée and childhood friend, at her parents' chateau. In a bar he sees his cousin Thibault, a stockbroker, who says he is welcome to stay at Thibault's apartment in Paris but wonders why Pierre is being followed by a young vagrant woman. When Pierre turns to look, the woman runs away. Driving through the forest, Pierre is disturbed to see the vagrant woman, who resembles a ghostly figure from his dreams. She tells him in a strong foreign accent that she is his half-sister Isabelle and recounts her unhappy life. She and her two companions (a Romanian woman, Razerka, and a small girl) are apparently refugees from conflict in Eastern Europe. Abandoning his home, mother and fiancée, Pierre takes Isabelle to Paris and goes to see Thibault, who bitterly insists he doesn't recognise the man and throws them out. Wandering the streets of Paris, fearful of deportation, the group find a cheap hotel. Pierre rejects his previous ideas for a second novel in favour of a grittier, more mature work that reflects the hidden truths of life. His publisher warns that his sophomoric pursuit of harsh truths will result in affected and inferior work compared to the youthful innocence that comes naturally to him, and refuses his request for an advance. At the zoo, Pierre misanthropically tells the small girl that the animals act unhappy because to them, all humans stink. She is slapped by an adult stranger after telling random people in the street that they stink, falls, and incurs a head wound she dies from. Again fearful of deportation, Pierre, Isabelle, and Razerka leave her body and proceed to a run-down warehouse commandeered by a terroristic cult; apparently in exchange for chaperoning Razerka safely to a man she knows there, Pierre and Isabelle are given lodging with the group, who train for guerrilla warfare and practise industrial music. Pierre and Isabelle succumb to the incestuous passion that had been coalescing till that point. Pierre scribbles away in a daze punctuated by learning of his mother's death (apparently a suicide) while trying to find his whereabouts. In the winter Lucie, suffering from a recurring fever, finds Pierre at the warehouse and demands to stay there under a false identity to 'protect' Isabelle from the truth of his abandonment of her, accepting Pierre's disappearance and relationship with Isabelle out of love for him. Pierre similarly keeps the nature of his ties to Isabelle from Lucie. Isabelle feels inadequate and desperately tries to ingratiate herself with the two, offering to take care of Lucie during her periods of sickness. Desperate to raise funds, Pierre makes an appearance on television to reveal his true identity but finds some in the television audience disbelieving him and others hostile because of his disconnection to his debut novel. Pierre's long days of writing continue through the winter; at one point he dreams of him and Isabelle copulating and then drowning in a river of blood. During a walk by the Seine, the trio happen upon an autobiography of Pierre's father: he is alarmed when Isabelle seems not to recognise the man on the cover, supposedly their father whom Isabelle said she had met once. Despairing over the doubt in her she fears she has instilled in Pierre, Isabelle attempts suicide and goes to hospital where a vengeful Thibault reveals Lucie's true identity to her. Pierre is brutally rejected by his publisher after submitting his manuscript anonymously, and Isabelle confronts him over his deception of her. Pierre despairs on seeing Lucie debasing herself by living in the squat and at the ruination of his plans; he accepts an invitation from Thibault to fight and steals two handguns from the cult to confront his cousin in central Paris, where Pierre immediately shoots Thibault in the head and is arrested. Till Lindemann (German pronunciation: [tɪl ˈlɪndəman]; born 4 January 1963) is a German singer and songwriter. He is the lead vocalist and lyricist of Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein and solo project Lindemann. Rammstein has sold over 25 million records worldwide, with five of their albums receiving platinum status, and Lindemann has been listed among the \"50 Greatest Metal Frontmen of All Time\" by Roadrunner Records. Lindemann has also appeared in minor roles in films and has also published three books of poetry. He has presented some of his original poems and scripts to galleries.    Early life  Lindemann was born on 4 January 1963 in Leipzig (then in East Germany), the son of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) journalist Brigitte Hildegard \"Gitta\" Lindemann and poet Werner Lindemann. His parents first met at a conference in Bitterfeld in 1959. He grew up in Wendisch-Rambow alongside his younger sister, Saskia. At age 11, Lindemann went to a sports school at the sports club SC Empor Rostock, and attended a boarding school from 1977 to 1980. His parents lived separately for career reasons after 1975, and divorced when Lindemann was still young. He lived with his father for a short time, but the relationship was unhealthy; in the book Mike Oldfield im Schaukelstuhl, his father wrote about his own problems with alcoholism and the difficulties of being a father to a teenage Lindemann. In 1978, Lindemann participated in the European Junior Swimming Championships in Florence, finishing 11th in the 1500 m freestyle and 7th in the 400 m freestyle, swimming a time of 4'17\"58; he was shortlisted to go to the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, but left the sport due to an injury. According to Lindemann, \"I never liked the sport school actually, it was very intense. But as a child you don't object.\" He later worked as an apprentice carpenter, a gallery technician, a peat cutter, and a basket weaver. His mother dedicated a letter titled Mein Sohn, der Frontmann von Rammstein (\"My son, the frontman of Rammstein\") to Lindemann in 2009. The first album he owned was Deep Purple's Stormbringer.    Career     Music   Lindemann started to play drums for Schwerin-based experimental rock band First Arsch in 1986, who released an album titled Saddle Up in 1992, and played one song (\"Lied von der unruhevollen Jugend\") with a punk band called Feeling B, which was the former band of Rammstein members Paul Landers, Christoph Schneider and Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz in 1989. During his time in Feeling B, he played the drums in the band. In the 1990s, Lindemann began to write lyrics. In 1994, the band entered and won a contest in Berlin that allowed them to record a four track demo professionally. When questioned as to why Rammstein was named after the Ramstein air show disaster, he said he viewed images of the incident on television, and that he and the bandmates wanted to make a musical memorial. Lindemann then moved to Berlin. During Rammstein's early years, because of his use of over-the-top pyrotechnics, Lindemann has burned his ears, hair and arms. Bandmate Christoph Schneider commented, \"Till gets burned all the time, but he likes the pain.\" An incident in September 1996 caused a section of the band's set to burn, and as a result, Lindemann got his certification in pyrotechnics so the band could perform with pyrotechnics more safely than it had previously. During Rammstein's US tour in June 1999, Lindemann and his bandmate Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz were arrested in Worcester, Massachusetts, for lewd conduct performed during their song \"Bück dich\" (\"bend over\"), which consisted of Lindemann using a liquid squirting dildo and simulating anal sex on Lorenz. Both Lindemann and Lorenz were released the following day after bail was met. This incident did not stop Lindemann from performing in the same manner for future shows outside the United States, particularly in Australia when they performed at the 2011 Big Day Out, but the United States performances of this song were changed into a sadomasochistic theme that did not feature dildos, although this was not the case for all remaining US shows on the tour. For example, on 18 June 1999, \"Bück dich\" was performed in the same manner at the Roseland Theater in Portland, Oregon. Alex Christophe Dupont (born 22 November 1960), best known as Leos Carax , is a French film director, critic, and writer. Carax is noted for his poetic style and his tortured depictions of love. His first major work was \"Boy Meets Girl\" (1984), and his notable works include \"Les Amants du Pont-Neuf\" (1991) and \"Holy Motors\" (2012). His professional name is an anagram of his real name, 'Alex', and 'Oscar'. == Early life ==\nCarax was born Alex Christophe Dupont in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine, a commune in the suburbs of Paris, France. His mother is American and his father is French.\n\n\n== Career ==\nCarax's film career began with a series of short films, and as a film critic, before he released Boy Meets Girl (1984), which established his reputation for a mature visual style. It also saw the first grouping of Carax with Denis Lavant and cinematographer Jean-Yves Escoffier. His next film was Mauvais Sang (literally Bad Blood but mostly known as The Night is Young) in 1986, which alienated some of his audience, but continued to explore the complexities of love in the modern world, this time through a darker, more criminal viewpoint. The work was clearly an homage to French New Wave cinema, and his use of such actresses as Juliette Binoche was a tribute to his influences, especially Jean-Luc Godard. The film was entered into the 37th Berlin International Film Festival.\nFive years later, Carax returned to directing with Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, an expensive undertaking as Parisian authorities granted him only 10 days to film on Pont Neuf. His initial reaction to the problems of filming on a public bridge had been to construct a model of the bridge in the community of Lansargues, in Southern France. But on the first day of filming Lavant severely injured his thumb, which pushed the movie back by a month. Subsequent financial difficulties further pushed filming over a much longer period than intended. The movie was released to critical acclaim and opened the door for Carax to enter more experimental waters with his fourth feature, Pola X (1999), an adaptation of Herman Melville's Pierre: or, The Ambiguities.\nCarax's 2012 film Holy Motors also stars Lavant. The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.\nIn 2017, Carax performed vocals and accordion on the Sparks track \"When You're a French Director\" from their album Hippopotamus.\nIn 2021, Carax directed Annette, a music-filled drama feature film written by Sparks and starring Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard, for which he won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.\nIn 2024, Carax will star in the short film An Urban Allegory, co-directed by Alice Rohrwacher and JR, which will make its world premiere out of competition at the 81st Venice International Film Festival.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Director ===\n\n\n==== Films ====\n\n\n==== Music videos ====\n\n\n=== As actor === Etan Boritzer( born 1950) is an American writer of children ’s literature who is best known for his book\" What is God?\" first published in 1989. His best selling\" What is?\" illustrated children's book series on character education and difficult subjects for children is a popular teaching guide for parents, teachers and child- life professionals. Boritzer gained national critical acclaim after\" What is God?\" was published in 1989 although the book has caused controversy from religious fundamentalists for its universalist views. The other current books in the\" What is?\" series include What is Love?, What is Death?, What is Beautiful?, What is Funny?, What is Right?, What is Peace?, What is Money?, What is Dreaming?, What is a Friend?, What is True?, What is a Family?, What is a Feeling?\" The series is now also translated into 15 languages. Boritzer was first published in 1963 at the age of 13 when he wrote an essay in his English class at Wade Junior High School in the Bronx, New York on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. His essay was included in a special anthology by New York City public school children compiled and published by the New York City Department of Education. Boritzer now lives in Venice, California and maintains his publishing office there also. He has helped numerous other authors to get published through\" How to Get Your Book Published!\" programs.

Back home, Henry's career begins to spiral, exacerbated by an onstage meltdown, and he comes to resent Ann's continued success. The two schedule a private cruise with the goal of mending their relationship. However, the cruise ends in disaster when Ann falls overboard during a stormy night after Henry drunkenly forces her to waltz with him. After realizing that his wife is dead, Henry and Annette get to an island using a lifeboat. There, both fall asleep, when Ann's ghost suddenly appears and gives her voice to infant Annette as a form of revenge, so she can haunt Henry. Though cleared of legal suspicion for Ann's death, Henry finds himself at a financial dead-end without her income. He contacts Ann's former accompanist, revealing Annette's singing voice and suggesting they use her gift for a musical act. The accompanist reluctantly agrees, having been in love with Ann, and as they tour, Baby Annette becomes a worldwide hit. Henry continues to drink heavily and stay out late, haunted by memories of Ann. One night, when returning home, Henry overhears Annette singing a rendition of “We Love Each Other So Much”, which was Ann and Henry's song. He confronts the accompanist, who implies that he is Annette's real father. In retaliation, Henry drowns him in the backyard pool, witnessed by Annette from her bedroom window. Henry plans one final performance at the \"Hyperbowl\" halftime show, but Annette refuses to sing, instead declaring, \"Daddy kills people,\" to the packed stadium. Henry is tried and convicted. A few years later, Annette visits her father in prison. Annette, suddenly portrayed by a living human girl, denies his attempts at reconciliation and even blames her mother for using her to get revenge. She tells him that he now has \"nothing to love\". Holy Motors is a 2012 surrealist fantasy drama film written and directed by Leos Carax and starring Denis Lavant and Édith Scob. Lavant plays Mr. Oscar, a man who appears to have a job as an actor, as he is seen dressing up in different costumes and performing various roles in several locations around Paris over the course of a day, though no cameras or audiences are ever seen around him. The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.    Plot  A man wakes up and finds a secret door in his apartment. He opens it and wanders into a movie theater full of sleeping patrons. A naked child and several dogs wander the aisles. Meanwhile, in Paris, a rich man waves goodbye to his family and gets into a white limousine. His driver, Céline, calls him Mr. Oscar and tells him he has nine appointments that day. He reads a file, uncovers a mirror, and begins to brush a grey wig. Over the course of the day, he:  plays an old woman beggar on the Pont Alexandre III. dons a motion capture suit and enters an empty sound stage, where he performs action sequences while being directed by an unseen man. A woman in a motion capture suit enters, and the pair perform movements that are used to create a sex scene between animated snakelike creatures. plays the role of Monsieur Merde, an eccentric and violent red-haired man who lives in the sewers and kidnaps a beautiful model called Kay M. from a photo shoot in a cemetery. plays a father who picks up his daughter from a party in an old red car. They argue when the daughter reveals she spent the party hiding in the bathroom instead of socializing. (as an interlude) plays a song on the accordion in a church with an ever-growing group of musicians. plays a gangster assigned to murder a man who looks identical to him. After he has stabbed the man in the neck and carved scars into the man's face that match his own, the victim suddenly stabs Oscar in the neck. Oscar manages to limp his way back to the limousine, seemingly severely injured. While Oscar is removing his makeup, a man with a port-wine stain on his face reveals his presence in the limo. The man asks Oscar if he still enjoys his work, since he has looked \"tired\" recently. Oscar admits it is harder now that he cannot see the cameras, but says he continues for \"the beauty of the act\". yells at Céline to stop, runs from the limo wearing a red balaclava covered with barbed wire, and shoots a banker who looks just like he did in the morning when he left for his first appointment. He is gunned down by the banker's bodyguards and Céline rushes to him. As she leads him away, she apologizes and says there has been a mix-up. plays the elderly \"Mr. Vogan\", who enters a hotel and gets into bed in one of the rooms. Vogan's niece Léa enters, they talk about their lives, and he dies. While Léa cries, Oscar gets out of bed and excuses himself to go to another appointment. He asks Léa her real name, and she says it is Élise and that she also has another appointment. (in what does not seem to be one of his appointments) is almost hit by another white limousine, whose female passenger he recognizes. Still in pajamas, Oscar asks if they can talk, and they go to the abandoned La Samaritaine building, where Jean (the woman) says they have 20 minutes to catch up on the past 20 years before her \"partner\" arrives and she will play the last night of an air hostess named Eva Grace. As they ascend to the roof of the building, she sings a wistful song that indicates she and Oscar \"once had a child\". Oscar leaves her and, avoiding the male partner on the staircase, returns to his limo. When he sees that Eva and the partner have jumped to their deaths from the top of the building, he lets out an anguished cry and runs past them and directly back into the limo as he does so. plays a man whose wife and children are chimpanzees. Alone, Céline drives to the Holy Motors garage, which is filled with other limousines. She parks, places a teal mask on her face, and leaves. The moment she is gone, the limousines begin to talk to one another, expressing fear that they are outdated and unwanted.    Cast  Denis Lavant as Mr. Denis Lavant (born 17 June 1961) is a French actor. He is known for his distinctive face and the physically demanding aspects of the roles he plays, which often involve slapstick, acrobatics or dance, as well as for his long-standing association with director Leos Carax. Lavant has played the lead role in all but two of Carax's films. Lavant is also known for his roles in Claire Denis' Beau Travail, and Harmony Korine's Mister Lonely.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nLavant was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, in France. At 13, he took courses in pantomime and the circus, fascinated by Marcel Marceau. He trained at the Paris Conservatoire under Jacques Lassalle, and began his professional career in 1982 in theatre, acting in Shakespeare's Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice. In 1982 he appeared in the television film L'Ombre sur la plage, before playing the minor part of Montparnasse in Robert Hossein's Les Misérables, which was entered into the 13th Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Special Prize. He appeared in several further minor roles before making his breakthrough in 1984 as the lead in Boy Meets Girl, playing a depressed, aspiring filmmaker who falls in love with a suicidal young woman. The film marked the feature-film debut of Leos Carax, with whose work Lavant has been associated ever since.\nIn 1986, Lavant and Carax worked together again on the thriller Mauvais Sang and again in 1991 on Carax's third film, Les Amants du Pont-Neuf. In both Mauvais Sang and Les Amants du Pont-Neuf, Lavant starred opposite Juliette Binoche. In 1998, Lavant appeared in the Jonathan Glazer-directed video for the UNKLE song \"Rabbit in Your Headlights\", and in 1999, he played one of the lead roles in Beau Travail, directed by Claire Denis. In 2007, he appeared in Harmony Korine's Mister Lonely, in which he portrayed a Charlie Chaplin impersonator. Lavant, who does not speak English, took an intensive language course in preparation and learned his lines phonetically. His longtime associate Leos Carax appears in a supporting role as the main character's talent agent.\nIn 2008, Lavant and Carax re-united for the anthology film Tokyo!, which marked their first work together since Lovers on the Bridge and Carax's first major directing work in nearly a decade. Carax's segment for the film, called \"Merde,\" starred Lavant as a violent monster who lives in the sewers of Tokyo and speaks in a gibberish language, venturing out occasionally to attack passersby.\nIn 2012, he starred in Leos Carax' film Holy Motors where he plays a \"chameleonic actor on assignment, ferried around Paris in a white limousine and changing en route from beggar-woman to satyr to assassin to victim.\" The film was an entrant at the Cannes Film Festival.\nIn 2016, he starred in a 30-second clip directed by Yorgos Lanthimos to accompany the song \"Identikit\" by Radiohead.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDenis Lavant at IMDb\n«Cache-cache avec la mort» de Mikhail Volokhov.

Although it is ubiquitous in films intended as pornographic, it is very uncommon in other films. At one time in the United States, such scenes were restricted by law and self-imposed industry standards such as the Motion Picture Production Code. Films showing explicit sexual activity were confined to privately distributed underground films, such as stag films or \"porn loops\". In the 1960s, social attitudes about sex began to shift, and sexually explicit films were decriminalized in many countries. With movies such as Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, mainstream movies began pushing the boundaries of what was presented on screen. Notable examples include two of the eight Bedside-films and the six Zodiac-films from the 1970s, all of which were produced in Denmark and had many pornographic sex scenes, but were nevertheless considered mainstream films, all having mainstream casts and crews and premiering in mainstream cinemas. The last of these films, Agent 69 Jensen i Skyttens tegn, was made in 1978. From the end of the 1970s until the late 1990s it was rare to see hardcore scenes in mainstream cinema, but this changed with the success of Lars von Trier's The Idiots (1998), which heralded a wave of art-house films with explicit content, such as Romance (1999), Baise-moi (2000), Intimacy (2001), Vincent Gallo's The Brown Bunny (2003), and Michael Winterbottom's 9 Songs (2004). Some simulated sex scenes are sufficiently realistic that critics mistakenly believe they are real, such as the cunnilingus scene in the 2006 film Red Road.    Terminology  Although it is common to discuss films for which the actors had sex on set using terms such as \"real sex\" or \"unsimulated sex\", some film scholars prefer to speak of \"visible sex\", \"explicit sex\", or \"hard-core sex\". Linda Williams, for instance, proposes that \"we eliminate the awkward term 'unsimulated sex' entirely\". This is also because most film censors have predominantly focused on whether sex acts (penetration, fellatio, cunnilingus) or aroused genitals are visible when deciding whether a film should be classified as pornographic or be distributed on general release. For instance, it was not uncommon for two versions of pornographic films to be released: a hardcore version subject to restrictions, and a softcore version passed at \"18\" level. In both cases, the actors performed sex acts on set, but they were visible only in the hardcore version. Moreover, there has been a huge blurring of the distinctions between the use of prostheses (in Trouble Every Day, Blue is the Warmest Colour, Battle in Heaven, Holiday), actual genital contact between actors (Intimacy, Baise-moi, The Brown Bunny, 9 Songs) and genitals added in post-production (Irreversible). The visibility of penetration/fellatio/cunnilingus on the screen is more important to the experience of watching the film, and often to the concerns of censors and critics, than exactly what took place on set. The idea of simulation also relates to questions about acting, unnecessarily denigrating pornography, and is too vague about what is being simulated. For instance, while an actor's penis may enter an actress's vagina on a porn set, this does not mean that each of their actions, emotions, noises, and so on, are not performed quite differently than they would be in the privacy of their own home: \"it is both real—something that actually happens between people—and a fake, staged for the camera and sound equipment. Neither the directors of pornography nor the directors of hard-core art, from Warhol forward, document 'real sex' in the sense of what people do alone, in private.\"    Rationales  In an interview after the release of his film Love (2015), when asked why audiences want to see realistic portrayals of sex, Gaspar Noé suggested it is about power structures: \"In most societies, whether they're Western or not, people want to control the sexual behaviour or to organise it in a precise context. Sex is like a danger zone. Sometimes class barriers fall down and it scares a lot of people. It's about states controlling their systems, like religion.\" James Franco has cited \"aesthetics and personal reasons\" for working on Interior. Leather Bar. (2013):  I've been a part of professional mainstream film for 17 years, and then in addition to that, I am a citizen of the United States and, you know, I am engaged with its mainstream culture, but I've also done a fair amount of studying queer theory or queer cinema classes.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: What is the date of death of the director of film Shocking Asia?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nShocking Asia is a 1974 mondo documentary film written and directed by Rolf Olsen with Ingeborg Stein Steinbach. The film was banned in Finland due to its graphic content. A sequel titled  was released in 1985. == Content ==\nAs with most other films of similar nature (such as Faces of Death and Traces of Death), Shocking Asia does not follow a traditional narrative structure, instead neglecting plot for images and video footage of bizarre and macabre situations such as animal cruelty, strange rituals, footage of deformed children and a sex change operation. Most of the clips used are claimed to be real, although this has yet to be verified. Shocking Blue was a Dutch rock band formed in The Hague in 1967. They were part of the Nederbeat movement in the Netherlands. The band had a string of hit songs during the counterculture movement of the 1960s and early 1970s, including \"Send Me a Postcard\" and \"Venus\", which became their biggest hit and reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and many other countries during 1969 and 1970. The band sold 13 million records by 1973 but disbanded in 1974. Together with Golden Earring, they are considered the most successful Nederbeat band, because they had their best hits charted abroad and especially in the United States.    History     Original era  Shocking Blue was founded in 1967 by the Motions guitarist Robbie van Leeuwen. Other members of the group at this time were Fred de Wilde, Klaasje van der Wal (1 February 1949 – 12 February 2018) and Cor van der Beek (9 June 1949 – 2 April 1998). They had a minor hit in 1968 with \"Lucy Brown is Back in Town\". When De Wilde was the band's lead singer, the band originally had a sound that was described as cross between the Beatles and Brothers Four.   De Wilde left in 1968 after joining the Dutch army, and van Leeuwen was introduced to Mariska Veres, singing at that time with a club band. He persuaded her to take over the vocals, and the group recorded a worldwide hit with the song \"Venus\", which entered the Veronica top 40 hit parade at position No.12 the 12 July 1969 and peaked at number three on 26 July 1969 in the Netherlands. The song was released in the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the year and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1970. It subsequently sold 350,000 copies in Germany and topped the U.S. chart for three weeks, the first song from the Netherlands to do so. It sold over one million copies there by January 1970 and received a gold record awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America. Global sales exceeded five million copies. Other hits include \"Send Me a Postcard\" in late 1968 and \"Long and Lonesome Road\" (often mistakenly named as \"Long Lonesome Road\") in 1969. \"Venus\" was followed by \"Mighty Joe\" (flip-side \"Wild Wind\") in 1969 and \"Never Marry a Railroad Man\" (flip-side \"Roll Engine Roll\") in 1970, both of which sold over a million records. The latter became a top-ten hit in several countries around the world. Later songs were successful in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, including \"Hello Darkness\", \"Demon Lover\" (1970), \"Shocking You\", \"Blossom Lady\" and \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind\" (1971), \"Inkpot\", \"Rock in the Sea\" and \"Eve and the Apple\" (1972) and \"Oh Lord\" (1973), but they failed to make the charts in the U.S. or U.K. Klaasje van der Wal left towards the end of 1971, following their first trip to Japan (which spawned a live album). In 1974, Robbie Van Leeuwen quit, and Mariska Veres left later that year, leading to the band's split. Veres went on to pursue a solo career until 1982.    Reunions  Shocking Blue reformed with its most famous line-up in 1979 and recorded \"Louise\" as their first single since their break-up in 1974. The song was never released. They did, however, perform live in 1980 with earlier songs such as \"Venus\" and \"Never Marry a Railroad Man\".  The band attempted another comeback in 1984 and released a new single \"The Jury and the Judge\" with \"I Am Hanging on to Love\" as the B-side in 1986.  In 1994 the single \"Body and Soul\" was released.    Legacy  Drummer Cor van der Beek died on 2 April 1998 at age 49 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Mariska Veres died of gallbladder cancer on 2 December 2006 at age 59 in The Hague, Netherlands. Bassist Klaasje van der Wal died on 12 February 2018 at age 69. Bananarama covered \"Venus\" in 1986, hitting number 1 in the United States, Canada, and Australia, and reaching number 8 in the UK. Thomas Scott( 1907- date of death unknown) was an English diver. An exploitation film is a film that tries to succeed financially by exploiting current trends, niche genres, or lurid content. Exploitation films are generally low-quality \"B movies\", though some set trends, attract critical attention, become historically important, and even gain a cult following.    History  Exploitation films often include themes such as suggestive or explicit sex, sensational violence, drug use, nudity, gore, destruction, rebellion, mayhem, and the bizarre. Such films were first seen in their modern form in the early 1920s, but they were popularized in the 60s and 70s with the general relaxing of censorship and cinematic taboos in the U.S. and Europe. An early example, the 1933 film Ecstasy, included nude scenes featuring the Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr. The film proved popular at the box office but caused concern for the American cinema trade association, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA). The organisation, which applied the Hays Code for film censorship, also disapproved of the work of Dwain Esper, the director responsible for exploitation movies such as Marihuana (1936) and Maniac (1934). The Motion Picture Association of America (and its predecessor, the MPPDA) cooperated with censorship boards and grassroots organizations in the hope of preserving the image of a \"clean\" Hollywood, but the distributors of exploitation film operated outside of this system and often welcomed controversy as a form of free promotion. Their producers used sensational elements to attract audiences lost to television. Since the 1990s, this genre has also received attention in academic circles, where it is sometimes called paracinema. \"Exploitation\" is loosely defined and arguably has as much to do with the viewer's perception of the film as with the film's actual content. Titillating material and artistic content often co-exist, as demonstrated by the fact that art films that failed to pass the Hays Code were often shown in the same grindhouses as exploitation films. Exploitation films share the fearlessness of acclaimed transgressive European directors such as Derek Jarman, Luis Buñuel and Jean-Luc Godard in handling \"disreputable\" content. Many films recognized as classics contain levels of sex, violence and shock typically associated with exploitation films. Examples include Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, Tod Browning's Freaks and Roman Polanski's Repulsion. Buñuel's Un Chien Andalou contains elements of the modern splatter film. It has been suggested that if Carnival of Souls had been made in Europe, it would be considered an art film, while if Eyes Without a Face had been made in the U.S., it would have been categorized as a low-budget horror film. The audiences of art and exploitation film are both considered to have tastes that reject the mainstream Hollywood offerings. Exploitation films have often exploited news events in the short-term public consciousness that a major film studio may avoid because of the time required to produce a major film. Child Bride (1938), for example, tackled the issue of older men marrying young girls in the Ozarks. Other issues, such as drug use in films like Reefer Madness (1936), attracted audiences that major film studios would usually avoid to keep their respectable, mainstream reputations. With enough incentive, however, major studios might become involved, as Warner Bros. did in their 1969 anti-LSD, anti-counterculture film The Big Cube. The film Sex Madness (1938) portrayed the dangers of venereal disease from premarital sex. Mom and Dad, a 1945 film about pregnancy and childbirth, was promoted in lurid terms. She Shoulda Said No! (1949) combined the themes of drug use and promiscuous sex. In the early days of film, when exploitation films relied on such sensational subjects as these, they had to present a very conservative moral viewpoint to avoid censorship, as movies then were not considered to enjoy First Amendment protection. Several war films were made about the Winter War in Finland, the Korean War and the Vietnam War before the major studios showed interest. When Orson Welles' radio production of The War of the Worlds from The Mercury Theatre on the Air for Halloween in 1938 shocked many Americans and made news, Universal Pictures edited their serial Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars into a short feature called Mars Attacks the World for release in November of that year. Some Poverty Row low-budget B movies often exploit major studio projects. Their rapid production schedule allows them to take advantage of publicity attached to major studio films. For example, Edward L. Alperson produced William Cameron Menzies' film Invaders from Mars to beat Paramount Pictures' production of director George Pal's The War of the Worlds to the cinemas, and Pal's The Time Machine was beaten to the cinemas by Edgar G. Ulmer's film Beyond the Time Barrier. Mondo film is a subgenre of exploitive documentary films. Many mondo films are made in a way to resemble a pseudo-documentary and usually depicting sensational topics, scenes, or situations. Common traits of mondo films include portrayals of foreign cultures (which have drawn accusations of ethnocentrism or racism), an emphasis on taboo subjects such as death and sex, and staged sequences presented as genuine documentary footage. Over time, the films have placed increasing emphasis on footage of the dead and dying (both real and fake). The term mondo is derived from the Italian word for 'world'. The term shockumentary is also used to describe the genre. Mondo films began to soar in popularity in the 1960s with the releases of Mondo Cane (1962), Women of the World (1963) and Africa Addio (1966). The genre arguably reached its peak with Faces of Death (1978), a film that inspired a myriad of imitators, such as Banned from Television, Death Scenes, and the Traces of Death  and Faces of Gore series.    History  Although earlier films such as Alessandro Blasetti's Europa di notte  (Europe By Night, 1959) and Luigi Vanzi's Il mondo di notte  (World By Night, 1961) may be considered examples of the genre, the origins of the mondo documentary are generally traced to the 1962 Italian film Mondo Cane (A Dog's World—a mild Italian profanity) by Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi which was a commercial success. Documentary films imitating Mondo Cane in the 1960s often included the term mondo in their titles, even if they were in English; examples include Mondo Bizarro, Mondo Daytona, Mondo Mod, Mondo Infame and Mondo Hollywood. Films outside the genre followed suit: Mondo Trasho, Mondo Weirdo: A Trip to Paranoia Paradise, Mondo Keyhole and Mondo Brutale (a German release of Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left) title themselves mondo, although none are mondo documentaries. Later in the decade, this naming convention began to fall out of favour and fewer mondo films identified themselves as such in their titles. The War Game, a 1965 British film depicting conditions before and after a nuclear attack on England, would not see public broadcast for twenty years. Filmmakers wanted to top each other in shock value to attract audiences. Cruelty to animals, accidents, tribal-initiation rites and surgeries are features of a typical mondo. Much of the action is staged, although the filmmakers may claim their goal is to document \"reality\". Subjects of mondo films include sex (Mondo Sex and Mondo Sexualis USA); celebrities (Mondo Elvis and Mondo Lugosi); youth culture (Mondo Teeno) and the gay subculture (Mondo Rocco). Russ Meyer's film Mondo Topless was one of the few \"documentaries\" restricted to the old midnight movie circuit in the pre-VCR era; it explored strip clubs in 1960s San Francisco, at a time when strip clubs were a novelty in the United States, restricted to centers of port-city decadence (such as San Francisco). Other examples of this genre include Mondo New York by Harvey Keith, Mondo di Notte by Gianni Proia and Mondo Balordo by Roberto Bianchi Montero. The 1980s saw a resurgence of mondo movies focusing almost exclusively on (onscreen) death, instead of world cultures. The Faces of Death series is a notable example of this type of mondo (or \"death\") movie. The producers used fake footage (passed off as real), but some of the footage was legitimate (including scenes of autopsies, suicides and accidents). The rare 1985 film Mondo Senza Veli (\"World Without Veils or Mondo Fresh\") was purported by viewers to feature at its end the brutal execution of a young Arab rapist by public rectal impalement. This episode was, however, believed to have been a staged execution by some viewers. Mondo films in the 21st century feature gore, exemplified by the Faces of Gore and Traces of Death series. There is less fake footage, and many use news footage of accidents from East Asia. The late 2010s saw another resurgence, beginning with the Bootleg Death Tape series and Faces of Dying series from filmmaker Dustin Ferguson, which both involved various independent Directors from around the world. A number of films have parodied the genre. Examples include Ricardo Fratelli's Mondo Ford, Mr. Mike's Mondo Video by Saturday Night Live's Michael O'Donoghue, and Is There Sex After Death? by Jeanne and Alan Abel. Mondo Beyondo spoofed the films' approach to titling, but was a parody of satellite television. Harry Wainwright( born 1899; date of death unknown) was an English footballer.

Starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, it tells the story of Frances \"Baby\" Houseman (Grey), a young woman who falls in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle (Swayze) at a vacation resort. The film was based on screenwriter Bergstein's own childhood. She originally wrote a screenplay for the Michael Douglas film It's My Turn, but she ultimately ended up conceiving a story for a film which became Dirty Dancing. She finished the script in 1985, but management changes at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer put the film in development hell. The production company was changed to Vestron Pictures with Emile Ardolino as director and Linda Gottlieb as producer. Filming took place in Lake Lure, North Carolina, and Mountain Lake, Virginia, with the film's score composed by John Morris and dance choreography by Kenny Ortega. Dirty Dancing premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 12, 1987 and was released on August 21 in the United States, earning over $214 million worldwide—$64 million in the US and Canada and $150 million in other territories. It earned positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised the performances of Grey and Swayze, and its soundtrack, created by Jimmy Ienner, generated two multi-platinum albums and multiple singles. \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\", performed by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The film's popularity successfully launched its titular franchise, including a 1988 television series, multiple reality competition shows, a 2004 prequel titled Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, a stage production which has had sellout performances in multiple countries, a made-for-television musical adaptation in 2017, and an untitled sequel scheduled to be released in 2025, with Grey reprising her role.     Plot  In the summer of 1963, teenager Frances \"Baby\" Houseman is vacationing with her family—cardiologist father Jake, mother Marge and older sister Lisa—at Kellerman's, an upscale Catskills resort in the Borscht Belt owned by Jake's sarcastic best friend Max. Exploring one night, Baby secretly observes Max instructing the waiters, all Ivy League students, to romance the guests' daughters, no matter how unattractive. Max also demeans the working-class entertainment staff, including Johnny Castle, one of the dance instructors. Baby is attracted to Johnny and dances briefly with him after his kindhearted cousin, Billy, introduces them at a secret \"dirty dancing\" party for resort staff. Max's grandson Neil flirts with Baby in the meantime. Baby learns Johnny's dance partner Penny is pregnant by Robbie, a waiter and womanizer who attends the Yale School of Medicine and now has his eye on Lisa. When Robbie refuses to help Penny, Baby borrows money from her father, without explaining why, to pay for Penny's abortion. At first, Penny declines as it would cause her and Johnny to miss a performance at a nearby resort, costing them the season's salary, but Baby volunteers to stand in for Penny. During her dance sessions with Johnny, they develop a mutual attraction, and despite their failure to execute a climactic lift, Johnny and Baby's performance is successful. Back at Kellerman's, Penny is badly injured by the botched abortion, and Baby enlists her father's help to stabilize Penny. Angered by Baby's deception, and assuming Johnny got Penny pregnant, Dr. Houseman commands Baby to stay away from them. Baby sneaks off to apologize to Johnny for her father's treatment, but Johnny feels he deserves it due to his lower status; Baby reassures him of his worth, declaring her love. They begin secretly seeing each other, and her father refuses to talk to her.  Johnny rejects an indecent proposal by Vivian Pressman, an adulterous wife, who instead sleeps with Robbie, inadvertently foiling Lisa's plan to lose her virginity to him. When Vivian spots Baby leaving Johnny's cabin, she feels spurned and attempts revenge on Johnny by claiming he stole her husband's wallet. Max is ready to fire Johnny, but Baby backs up his alibi, revealing she was with Johnny the night of the theft. The real thieves, Sydney and Sylvia Schumacher, are caught, but Johnny is still fired for mixing with Baby. Before leaving, Johnny tries to talk to Dr. Houseman but is accused of only trying to get at Baby. Baby later apologizes to her father for lying, but not for her romance with Johnny, and then accuses him of classism.

Plot  Architect Peter Mitchell, cartoonist Michael Kellam, and actor Jack Holden are happy bachelors in their shared New York apartment, with frequent parties and flings. One day, a baby named Mary arrives on their doorstep with a note revealing she is the result of Jack's tryst with an actress named Sylvia during a Stratford Festival Shakespearean production a year prior. Jack is in Turkey shooting a B movie, and makes arrangements with a director friend to have a package delivered to the apartment. Jack asks his roommates to keep the delivery a secret per his friend's wishes; when Mary arrives, they believe she is the \"package\". Peter and Michael are totally befuddled how to care for Mary, and Peter leaves to buy supplies. Their landlady Mrs. Hathaway delivers a small box – the actual \"package\" of heroin – which Michael tosses aside. They learn to care for Mary, including diaper changes, baths, and feedings. Four days later, two drug dealers arrive at the apartment for the package. Peter and Michael mistakenly give them Mary, along with a can of powdered milk the dealers believe is the heroin. Peter discovers the actual package; realizing the mix-up, he runs downstairs but trips, spilling the package's contents. He gathers up the drugs and confronts the men outside, causing a scuffle. A police officer on horseback intervenes; Peter rescues Mary, but the dealers flee with the can of powdered milk. The officer detains Peter and Michael at the apartment until Sgt. Melkowitz, a narcotics officer, arrives to question them. Jack calls from Turkey, but Peter and Michael are unable to talk openly as they are being recorded. They successfully hide the drugs, learning that Jack's friend Paul Milner is a drug dealer. A suspicious Melkowitz puts them under surveillance. Mrs. Hathaway babysits Mary while Peter and Michael go to work. Returning home, they find Mrs. Hathaway bound and gagged and the apartment ransacked by the dealers, but Mary safe; a note threatens, \"Next time we'll take the baby\". Peter and Michael continue to care for Mary, adjusting to 'fatherhood' and growing attached. Peter incapacitates an intruder, who turns out to be Jack, returning early after his movie role was cut. Jack assures Peter and Michael he knew nothing about the heroin. He initially denies his connection to Mary, but Sylvia's note convinces him he is Mary's father. Peter and Michael pass all parenting responsibility to Jack, who quickly grows to love her. They receive a news clipping in the mail – Milner has been attacked by the drug dealers and hospitalized – with another threat: \"Don't let this happen to you!\" Peter, Michael, and Jack formulate a plan to trap the dealers, arranging a meeting. Jack, disguised as a pregnant woman, leaves the building with Mary, while Peter and Michael leave in a cab, followed by undercover officers, but manage to lose them in another cab driven by Jack. The three meet the dealers at the top floor of a construction site. Michael, hidden in the vents, records Peter's conversation with the dealers but falls into the room, and a chase ensues. They manage to trap the dealers in an elevator as the police arrive. With the recording, they prove their innocence to Melkowitz, and the dealers are arrested. Peter, Michael, and Jack fully embrace their role as Mary's guardians, until Sylvia arrives to take Mary with her to London. After she leaves with Mary, the three realize how desperately they miss the baby. Racing to the airport, they just miss Sylvia's plane for London. Defeated, they return home to find Sylvia and Mary at the door. Sylvia tearfully says she doesn't want to give up acting but must if she has to raise Mary alone.

The film was remade in Hollywood as\" Three Men and a Baby\" in 1987 which was subsequently remade into six Indian movies in five different languages. The Three Men and a Baby franchise consists of American family-comedies produced by various studios of The Walt Disney Company, including two theatrical films, one television series adaptation, and one upcoming reboot film. Based on the script co-written by Jim Cruickshank & James Orr, which was based on the premise of the 1985 French movie. The plot centers around three best friends, who happily live their lives as single men, until a baby girl is left at their door. The individual installments detail their individual journeys, overcoming their personal desires to become effective selfless parents to the child. The first film was a mostly positive critical hit, and was deemed a box office success as it made the most money of any film in 1987. Conversely, its sequel was met with poor critical and financial reception with its perceived inferiority to its predecessor. The films have since received nostalgic retrospective appreciation, with some modern day critics classifying them as films with a cult following. The TV show was met with mixed reception from critics, though it gained a following with its viewers. The franchise will continue, with as-of-yet untitled reboot in development, as a streaming exclusive film for Disney+.    Origin  The Three Men and a Baby franchise is based on the 1985 French independent comedy titled, Trois Hommes Et Un Couffin (Three Men and a Cradle), written and directed by Coline Serreau. Distributed by Acteurs Auteurs Associés, the plot similarly deals with three friends, albeit college-aged young men roommates who discover a baby at their dorm-room doorstep. The plot follows their interactions with a drug mob, local police department, schooling, and their attempts to raise the child. The basic plot similarities differ greatly in their delivery, with the Hollywood adaptation and its franchise that followed taking an optimistic outlook on parenthood, as opposed to its source material from France. The original film became a Academy Award and Golden Globe nominee for \"Best Foreign\" film upon its release, and was followed by a sequel in 2003 titled, 18 ans après (18 Years After). In addition to spawning the American made franchise, it serve as inspiration for a number of foreign adaptations.

The teleplay by Arthur Laurents is an adaptation of his book of the 1959 stage musical Gypsy, which was based on the 1957 autobiography Gypsy: A Memoir by Gypsy Rose Lee. Gypsy Rose Lee's son, Erik Lee Preminger, was instrumental in getting the film in production and was the main source for research. He had tried to get the musical filmed with Bette Midler, who had always wanted to play Rose, in the principal role 10 years earlier, but it required the approval of five entities to obtain the rights. One of the obstacles had been Arthur Laurents himself, who wrote the book for the musical based on Lee's memoirs. He had hated the 1962 film version and was initially opposed to a remake. \"Not for all the money in the world will we let them make another film version of Gypsy,\" he had said. The film was originally broadcast by CBS on December 12, 1993, and then released in theaters in foreign markets. It has been released on home video multiple times. Director Ardolino died of AIDS three weeks before the film was broadcast.    Plot  Determined to make her young, blonde, and beautiful daughter, June, a vaudeville headliner, willful, resourceful, domineering stage mother Rose Hovick will stop at nothing to achieve her goal. She drags June and her shy, awkward, and decidedly less-talented older sister, Louise, around the country in an effort to get them noticed, and with the assistance of agent Herbie Sommers, she manages to secure them bookings on the prestigious Orpheum Circuit. Years pass, and the girls no longer are young enough to pull off the childlike personae their mother insists they continue to project. June rebels, and elopes with Tulsa, one of the dancers who backs the act. Devastated by what she considers an act of betrayal, Rose pours all her energies into making a success of Louise, despite the young woman's obvious lack of singing and dancing skills. Not helping matters is the increasing popularity of sound films, which leads to a decline in the demand for stage entertainment. With bookings scarce, mother and daughter find themselves in Wichita, Kansas, where the owner of a third-rate burlesque house offers Louise a job. When one of the strippers is arrested for soliciting, Louise unwillingly becomes her replacement. At first, her voice is shaky, and her moves tentative at best, but as audiences respond to her, she begins to gain confidence in herself. She blossoms as an entertainer billed as Gypsy Rose Lee, and eventually reaches a point where she tires of her mother's constant interference in both her life and wildly successful career. Louise confronts Rose and demands she leave her alone. Finally, aware that she has spent her life enslaved by a desperate need to be noticed, an angry, bitter, and bewildered Rose stumbles onto the empty stage of the deserted theater and experiences a moment of truth that leads to an emotional breakdown followed by a reconciliation with Louise.

The script was based on the 1985 French film(\" Three Men and a Cradle\"). The film was the biggest American box office hit of that year, surpassing\" Fatal Attraction\" and eventually grossing$ 167 million in the United States and Canada and$ 240 million worldwide. The film won the 1988 People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy Motion Picture.

Sister Act was one of the most financially successful comedies of the early 1990s, grossing $231 million worldwide against a $31 million budget. The film spawned a franchise, which consists of the 1993 sequel Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit and a musical adaptation, which premiered in 2006. A third film is in development for Disney+.    Plot  In 1968, Deloris Wilson is a young Catholic school student, who does not take her studies seriously and greatly embarrasses her nun teachers while showing an affinity for music. Twenty-four years later, in 1992, Deloris is a lounge singer in Reno, Nevada, performing as Deloris Van Cartier, in a club owned by her married gangster boyfriend Vince LaRocca. She then receives a shallow gift from Vince, and attempts to return it, only to witness Vince executing an informant. When he sets out to murder her as well, Deloris goes to the police for further assistance. Police lieutenant Eddie Souther places her in witness protection, and brings her to Saint Katherine's Parish, in a run-down neighborhood in San Francisco, for her to hide out in their struggling convent. Both Deloris, and the head nun of St. Katherine's, Reverend Mother, object to this arrangement, but Lt. Souther, and Monsignor O'Hara, the parish priest, convince them to go along with it, with the added deal that the police will pay the failing convent a good sum of money. Disguised as \"Sister Mary Clarence\", Deloris initially has difficulty dealing with the rigid and simple convent life, and butts heads with Reverend Mother, but she befriends the other nuns, including the optimistic Sister Mary Patrick, the elderly deadpan Sister Mary Lazarus, and the shy, young Novice Sister Mary Robert. One night, after a poorly attended Sunday Mass—with a lackluster performance from the convent choir led by Mary Lazarus—Deloris decides she needs a break, and she sneaks out to a bar, followed by Mary Patrick and Mary Robert. They are caught by the Reverend Mother, who considers kicking Deloris out, but instead, orders Deloris to join the struggling choir. With her singing experience, Deloris is elected to take over as their director and transforms the choir. At the next Sunday Mass, Deloris leads the much-improved choir in a traditional hymn of \"Hail Holy Queen\", then shifts into a combined gospel and rock and roll interpretation. Although Reverend Mother is infuriated, Monsignor O'Hara congratulates the choir for their unorthodox performance as new people were attracted to the service. Convinced by Deloris, he allows the nuns to clean the church and the neighborhood. Their singing and efforts to revitalize the neighborhood attract media attention, and the parish thrives. Souther chastises Deloris for nearly being exposed on national television as Vince has placed a bounty on her head. She assures him she will try to keep a lower profile, and Souther attends a Mass. The nun's choir continues to amaze parishioners and visitors, especially with a rendition of \"My Guy\" – rewritten and performed as \"My God\". O'Hara informs the convent that Pope John Paul II, having heard of the choir's success, will visit the church. Deloris tells Reverend Mother that Vince's upcoming trial means she will soon leave; the Mother reveals she has resigned as abbess, believing she is no longer useful to the convent as her authority was unintentionally undermined. Deloris tries to convince her to stay and keep the parish thriving as it is, but the Mother retorts that she believes herself too old-fashioned and incapable of doing so. Souther discovers a corrupt detective in his own department who has given Deloris's location to Vince and rushes to San Francisco to warn her. Vince's men kidnap her and Mary Robert, but Deloris helps Mary Robert to escape. When Mary Robert returns to the convent, Reverend Mother reveals to the nuns that Sister Mary Clarence is Deloris Van Cartier and explains why she had been hiding in their convent. They decide to rescue Deloris, requesting a helicopter pilot to fly them to Reno. In Reno, Vince orders his men to kill Deloris, but they cannot bring themselves to shoot her while she is dressed in a nun's habit. Arriving at Vince's casino, the nuns find Deloris after she escapes from Vince's men, and they try to sneak out of the casino, but they become cornered by Vince and her men, in the casino lounge.

He currently plays for Al- Ittihad, and is a member of the Libya national football team. Yash Chopra (1932–2012) was an Indian film director and producer known for his works in Bollywood. Acknowledged as one of the greatest filmmakers from the country, he was credited by the media for \"changing the face of romance to become a brand\" in the industry. He made his directorial debut with the family drama Dhool Ka Phool, which was produced by his elder brother Baldev Raj. The film, released in 1959, became a commercial success worldwide and gave him critical acclaim. Chopra's next film, Dharmputra (1961), failed to perform well at the box office but won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. In 1965, he directed the drama Waqt about a family who are separated due to a natural disaster. A commercial success, it was one of the earliest Indian films to star an ensemble cast and won a first Best Director trophy for him at the Filmfare Awards.\nThe 1980s was the most unsuccessful period of his career. Following the failure of his romantic drama Silsila (1981), which he co-wrote, directed and produced, Chopra's popularity began to wane. According to his biographer, the British academic Rachel Dwyer, this was because action and crime films were more popular at the time while most of his films were romances. Chopra experimented with making two action films, Mashaal (1984) and Vijay (1988), which underperformed financially but were well-received by critics. Chandni was his only box-office success of the decade. Starring Sridevi in the title role, the film tells the story of a young woman who is accused of being responsible for her lover's accident. Chopra's career began to revive since its premiere in 1989; the film was named the Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment at the 37th National Film Awards and considered one of his best films.\nChopra next directed and produced the intergenerational musical romantic drama Lamhe (1991). Although it did not succeed at the Indian box office, it proved to be a major commercial success in overseas territories. Parampara (1993) was the last film directed by Chopra but not produced under his company; reviewers were critical of it due to its clichéd storyline. The musical psychological thriller Darr (1993) and the romantic comedy Yeh Dillagi (1994)—both of which were produced by him, with Chopra serving as a director for the former—succeeded commercially. He later produced his son Aditya's directorial debut Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), the longest-running film in Indian cinema history. Chopra's next film, the musical romantic drama Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), was a major blockbuster and won the Filmfare Award for Best Film. After producing several films that performed well critically and commercially, including Mohabbatein (2000) and Saathiya (2002), Chopra returned to directing with the 2004 epic cross-border love saga  Veer-Zaara, which critics lauded for its portrayal of India–Pakistan relations. The film won several best film trophies at major award functions, including that of Filmfare. Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012) was the last film directed by him before his death.\n\n\n== Films ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nChopra, Anupama (December 2002).

Having denied Chopra admission into the National School of Drama due to his severe stammering as a young applicant, the Film Division of India eventually honored him with the National Award for his achievements in 1995, 2004, 2007 and 2015.  Widely regarded as the most influential executive in Indian entertainment, Chopra has however rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Yash Chopra's son and the chief executive of Yash Raj Films.    Early life  Chopra, the elder son of the late filmmaker Yash Chopra and Pamela Chopra, was born on 21 May 1971. His only sibling is actor and producer Uday Chopra. He is the nephew of film producers B.R. Chopra and Yash Johar, and the cousin of filmmakers Karan Johar and Ravi Chopra. He completed his formal education and acquired his Indian Certificate of Secondary Education from Bombay Scottish School. He graduated from Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics along with Anil Thadani, Karan Johar and Abhishek Kapoor.    Filmmaking career  Chopra started his film-making career at the age of 18 as an assistant director, working with his father on films such as Chandni (1989), Lamhe (1991) and Darr (1993). He also wrote his first screenplays for his father's Parampara (1992) and his mother's independently produced film Aaina (1993), which was the only film not directed by his father that he served as an assistant director on.    1995: Directorial debut and success  Chopra, after gaining a respectable amount of experience, started independently at the age of 23 with the all-time blockbuster romantic comedy-drama Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge (1995), with Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, for which he was the director and writer. The film was scripted by Chopra and produced by his father Yash Chopra, under the YRF banner. Chopra started work on the script of the film in 1990, at the age of 19, and gradually spent time making about five drafts of the film's original script. Chopra even managed to convince his brother Uday Chopra and Karan Johar, both aspiring filmmakers, to enter the film industry as assistant directors with the film. Chopra once said that the presence of his relatives during the making of the film worked as a huge emotional support. Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge eventually went on to become one of the biggest hits of all time and won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and the Filmfare Award for Best Film, in addition to the Filmfare Award for Best Director for Chopra.    1996–2002: Extensive work in Yash Raj Films  Chopra eventually went on to write the dialogues and the story of his father's 1997 musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai, (which won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment), also made under YRF. His next film as a director was the musical romantic drama Mohabbatein (2000) starring Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai, and also launched his brother Uday Chopra into the film industry. The film was also written and co-produced by Chopra and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, earning Chopra his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director. The next film under the banner was the romantic comedy Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai (2002), which released in June 2002, starring his brother Uday alongside Tulip Joshi, Bipasha Basu and Jimmy Sheirgill. The film did moderately well at the box office. The studio's final release that year was the romantic drama Saathiya  which starred Vivek Oberoi opposite Rani Mukerji. The film proved to be a major hit at the box office.    2004: Breakthrough in production  In 2004, Chopra produced the romantic comedy Hum Tum, the action thriller Dhoom and the epic love saga Veer-Zaara (for which he was also the screenwriter) under the YRF banner. All three films went on to become major critical and commercial successes, earning more than ₹200 crore (US$24 million) (unadjusted for inflation) in the worldwide market. The films became the sixth, third and highest-grossing Indian films of 2004.

Chopra  studied at Doaba College Jalandhar and originally sought to pursue a career in engineering. He later moved to Ludhiana, East Punjab (in India) after the Partition of India. His passion for film-making led him to travel to Bombay, where he initially worked as an assistant director to I. S. Johar, and then for his director-producer brother, B. R. Chopra, while another brother, Dharam Chopra, worked as his cameraman.    Career     Early career (1959–1969)  Chopra received his first directorial opportunity in 1959 with the social drama Dhool Ka Phool, produced by his elder brother B.R. Chopra and starring Mala Sinha, Rajendra Kumar and Nanda. The film revolved around a Muslim bringing up an \"illegitimate\" Hindu child. The film was well received by critics and became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year. Encouraged by their success, the Chopras made another hard-hitting social drama, Dharmputra (1961). It was one of the first films to depict the Partition of India and Hindu fundamentalism.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "question": "When is the director of film The Virginian (1923 Film) 's birthday?",
        "answer": "February 22, 1893",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When is the director of film The Virginian (1923 Film) 's birthday?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe Virginian (otherwise titled  The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains) is a 1902 novel by the American author Owen Wister (1860–1938), set in Wyoming Territory during the 1880s. It describes the life of a cowboy on a cattle ranch and is considered the first true fictional western ever written, aside from short stories and pulp dime novels, though modern scholars debate this.  The Virginian paved the way for many more westerns by such authors as Zane Grey, Max Brand, Louis L'Amour and several others. The novel was adapted from several short stories published in Harper's Magazine and The Saturday Evening Post between Nov 1893 and May 1902.    Fictional character  The Virginian is a ranch hand at the Sunk Creek Ranch, located outside of Medicine Bow, Wyoming. His friend Steve calls him \"Jeff\" presumably after Jefferson Davis, but he is always referred to as the Virginian, and no name is mentioned throughout the story. He is described as a tall, dark, slim young giant, with a deep personality. At first, he is only a cowboy, but halfway through the book, he is signed on as the full-time foreman. He is the Judge's most trusted worker. Several times throughout the book, he is offered the chance to run down his enemy, Trampas, behind his back, but each time he refuses the temptation, until Trampas challenges the Virginian to a duel. It is made clear that he will not use his official position as foreman to crush any of his employees.  One of the main plots is the Virginian's ongoing romance with the newly appointed \"schoolmarm\" of Bear Creek School, Miss Molly Stark Wood. Being from the East, she is not used to the wild West, and the Virginian is a perfect gentleman to her, intending to make her \"love him before we get through.\"    Plot summary   The novel begins with an unnamed narrator's arrival in Medicine Bow, Wyoming, from \"back East\" and his encounter with an impressively tall and handsome stranger. The stranger proves adept at roping horses, as well as facing down a gambler, Trampas, who calls him a \"son of a bitch.\" The stranger lays a pistol on the table and gently threatens, \"When you call me that, smile!\"  Known only as the Virginian, the stranger turns out to be the narrator's escort to Judge Henry's ranch in Sunk Creek, Wyoming. As the two travel the 263 miles to the ranch, the narrator, who is nicknamed the Tenderfoot, and the Virginian come to know one another as the Tenderfoot slowly begins to understand the nature of life in the West, which is very different from what he expected. This meeting is the beginning of a lifelong friendship and the starting point of the narrator's recounting of key episodes in the life of the Virginian. The novel revolves around the Virginian and the life he lives. As well as describing the Virginian's conflict with his enemy, Trampas, and his romance with the pretty schoolteacher, Molly Stark Wood, Wister weaves a tale of action, violence, hate, revenge, love, and friendship. In one scene, the Virginian is forced to participate in the hanging of Steve, an admitted cattle thief who had been his close friend. The hanging is represented as a necessary response to the government's corruption and lack of action, but the Virginian feels it to be a horrible duty. He is especially stricken by the bravery with which the thief faces his fate, and the heavy burden that the act places on his heart forms the emotional core of the story. A fatal shootout resolves the ongoing conflict with Trampas after five years of hate. After Trampas shoots first in a duel, the Virginian shoots Trampas in self defense and leaves to marry his young bride. The Virginian and Molly ride off together to spend a month in the mountains and then journey back East to Vermont to meet her family. They are received a bit stiffly by the immediate Wood family, but warmly by Molly's great-aunt. The new couple returns to Wyoming, and the Virginian is made a partner of Judge Henry's ranch. The book ends noting that the Virginian became an important man in the territory with a happy family.    Cultural influence  The 1902 novel had an enormous influence on publishing, and later movies and television, establishing the Western genre and especially the cowboy ideal as an American icon.  Its climactic gun duel is the first \"showdown\" in fiction. The novel is also the first known use of the phrase: \"When you call me that, smile!\"  This line, in many versions, became common in later Western works, from movies to music. Twenty-first century scholars of Western fiction debate whether The Virginian should be considered as the first cowboy novel outside the dime novel tradition. The Virginian is a 1929 American pre-Code Western film directed by Victor Fleming and starring Gary Cooper, Walter Huston, and Richard Arlen. The film was based on the 1902 novel The Virginian by Owen Wister and adapted from the popular 1904 theatrical play Wister had collaborated on with playwright Kirke La Shelle. The Virginian is about a good-natured cowboy who romances the new schoolmarm and has a crisis of conscience when he learns his best friend is involved in cattle rustling. The film is considered to be Gary Cooper's breakthrough role and is well known for Cooper's line \"If you wanna call me that—smile\", in response to an insult by the antagonist.    Plot  A man known only as the Virginian is ranch foreman at Box H Ranch near Medicine Bow, Wyoming. At a saloon in Medicine Bow, he and the cattle rustler Trampas vie for the attentions of a barmaid; when Trampas insults him, the Virginian pulls a gun and tells him to smile. Soon afterwards, Molly Wood, a new schoolteacher from Vermont, arrives in town. The Virginian and a drifter named Steve compete for her attentions. She ultimately chooses Steve, but the Virginian gives him a job at the ranch because they were friends in childhood. Unhappy with the Virginian's violent nature, Molly tries to change him but is unsuccessful. Steve and the Virginian enjoy playing pranks together, switching babies during a baptism; they also make quail calls for secret communications. However, Steve falls in with Trampas' gang. Although warned by the Virginian that no good will come of it, Steve continues with the gang. When they (except Trampas) steal cattle from Box H Ranch, the Virginian is forced to hang all involved, including Steve. The Virginian vows revenge on Trampas for forcing him to do so. Molly is disgusted by The Virginian's callousness, but after he is shot in the back by Trampas, she decides to treat him, they fall in love, and eventually decide to marry. On their wedding day, Trampas comes back to town for revenge and challenges the Virginian to a shoot-out. The Virginian quickly draws his six-shooter and kills the bandit in the streets. He then marries Molly, and the two prepare to open their own ranch.    Cast  Gary Cooper as the Virginian Walter Huston as Trampas Richard Arlen as Steve Mary Brian as Molly Stark Wood Chester Conklin as Uncle \"Pa\" Hughey Eugene Pallette as \"Honey\" Wiggin Victor Potel as Nebrasky E. H. Calvert as Judge Henry Helen Ware as Mrs \"Ma\" Taylor George Chandler as Bug Ears Randolph Scott as Rider (uncredited) Nina Quartero as Girl in Bar (uncredited)    Production  The Virginian was based on the 1902 novel of the same name written by Owen Wister and its 1904 stage play adaptation. This was the first sound adaptation of the novel, with two silent film adaptations released in 1914 and 1923. The film was not entirely faithful to the book. The film was directed by Victor Fleming; it was his first sound film. Gary Cooper, who had appeared in several silent films, was cast as the Virginian; it was his first leading role in a western and his first sound film. He was coached in the Virginian's accent by Randolph Scott. Production began in late May 1929, with shooting done in Sonora, California and Lone Pine, California. The railroad scenes were filmed on the Sierra Railway at Cooperstown near Oakdale in Stanislaus County, California. There was little studio shooting. To shoot outdoor scenes, the filmmakers used blimped cameras (cameras with internal soundproofing), which were a recent innovation. The film featured the traditional song \"Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie\", hummed and sung by Richard Arlen.    Techniques and style  Rather than synchronize every sound on screen with a shown action, The Virginian treated sound as at times being independent of the action; this allowed for greater symbolism. The film also heavily used natural sounds, such as cattle. This effect was facilitated by the outdoor shooting locations.    Reception   The Virginian was released on November 9, 1929, with a theatrical rerelease in 1935. Bruce Eder, writing for Allmovie (a site run by the Rovi Corporation), notes that the film was a significant milestone in Cooper's career. Terence D. Robinson( date of birth and death unknown) was a male wrestler who competed for England. Tom Forman (February 22, 1893 – November 7, 1926) was an American motion picture actor, director, writer, and producer of the early 1920s. == Life and career ==\nTexas-born Forman made his first film for Jesse L. Lasky's production company in 1914. With the exception of service at the front during World War I, he had a successful career as both an actor and director. Forman directed Lon Chaney's Shadows (1922), but his biggest achievement was realised directing the second screen version of Owen Wister's The Virginian (1923).  After his career faltered, he was reduced to working on cheap Poverty Row melodramas.  Forman is also known for his work with Edith Taliaferro in Young Romance.\nForman was set to direct the Columbia film The Wreck, which was to start shooting on November 8, 1926; however on the evening of November 7, Forman died by suicide by shooting himself through the heart at his parents' home in Venice, California.\nAdela Rogers St. Johns based the character of Maximillan Carey in her original story for What Price Hollywood?

The Virginian is a 1903 stage production based on the 1902 novel The Virginian by the American author Owen Wister (1860–1938) and set in Wyoming. The play was composed by Wister and playwright Kirke La Shelle, who also produced it. The story describes the life of a cowboy on a cattle ranch in northern Wyoming, where he tends cattle, identifies and hangs a rustler, kills a notorious bad guy, woos and finally marries a school teacher who had come to Wyoming from the East.\n\n\n== Productions ==\nThe earliest known production of The Virginian was at Boston's Majestic Theatre in October 1903. The Boston booking was apparently intended as a dry run before taking the play to Broadway. It opened on Broadway in New York at the Manhattan Theatre on January 5, 1904, and ran until May 1904.  Most of the actors who appeared in Boston were also in the Broadway production a few months later. The lead was played by Dustin Farnum who continued the role in New York. Molly Wood, the heroine, was well-acted by Nanette Comstock in Boston, but Agnes Ardeck apparently did a poorer job in New York. Other actors in both plays include Frank Campeau who played \"Trampas\"; Joseph A. Maylon playing \"John Taylor\"; and Thomas P. Jackson who played \"Andrew Dow/Shorty\". \nThe play was reprised in October 1905 for 16 performances at the Academy of Music in New York City.\nThere is some evidence that the play may have once been intended as a musical, for the song \"Dead Broke!\" is linked with it. However, none of the plays' reviews mention singing.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe play, more than the book, served as the basis for a number of film adaptations of The Virginian. Indeed, Dustin Farnum, who starred in all three runs of the play, also starred in the earliest film version.\nIn 2022 playwrights L.C Bernadine and Spencer Huffman newly adapted the novel for City Lit Theater in Chicago. The production opened on January 16 2022 for a 5-week run.\n\n\n== Films ==\nThe Virginian (1914 film) directed by Cecil B. DeMille, with Dustin Farnum\nThe Virginian (1923 film) with Kenneth Harlan and Florence Vidor\nThe Virginian (1929 film) with Gary Cooper and Walter Huston\nThe Virginian (1946 film) with Joel McCrea and Brian Donlevy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Virginian at Open Library\nOwen Wister Papers at the American Heritage Center The Virginian (1923) is a silent film based upon the Owen Wister novel \"The Virginian\" and adapted from the popular 1904 theatrical play Wister had collaborated on with playwright Kirke La Shelle.

Jan Tomáš \"Miloš\" Forman (; Czech: [ˈmɪloʃ ˈforman]; 18 February 1932 – 13 April 2018) was a Czech-American film director, screenwriter, actor, and professor who rose to fame in his native Czechoslovakia before emigrating to the United States in 1968. Throughout Forman's career he won two Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award, three Golden Globe Awards, a Golden Bear, a César Award, and the Czech Lion. Forman was an important figure in the Czechoslovak New Wave. Film scholars and Czechoslovak authorities saw his 1967 film The Firemen's Ball as a biting satire on Eastern European Communism. The film was initially shown in theatres in his home country in the more reformist atmosphere of the Prague Spring. However, it was later banned by the Communist government after the invasion by the Warsaw Pact countries in 1968. Forman was subsequently forced to leave Czechoslovakia for the United States, where he continued making films. He received two Academy Awards for Best Director for the psychological drama One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and the biographical drama Amadeus (1984). During this time, he also directed notable and acclaimed films such as Black Peter (1964), Loves of a Blonde (1965), Hair (1978), Ragtime (1981), Valmont (1989), The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and Man on the Moon (1999).    Early life   Miloš Forman's childhood was marked by the early loss of his parents. His mother, Anna Formanová, was murdered in 1943 in the Auschwitz concentration camp, and his father, Rudolf Forman, in the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp in 1944. Close relatives and friends of his parents raised him. After attending grammar school in Náchod, he went to a boarding school in Poděbrady following the end of the war; among his class-mates were Václav Havel and Jerzy Skolimowski.    Career  Along with cinematographer Miroslav Ondříček and long-time friend from school Ivan Passer, Forman filmed the silent documentary Semafor about the Semafor theater. Forman's first important production was Audition, a documentary about competing singers. He directed several Czech comedies in Czechoslovakia. He was in Paris negotiating the production of his first American film during the Prague Spring in 1968. His employer, a Czech studio, fired him, so he decided to move to the United States. He moved to New York, where he later became a professor of film at Columbia University in 1978 and co-chair (with his former teacher František Daniel) of Columbia's film department. One of his protégés was future director James Mangold, whom he mentored at Columbia. He regularly collaborated with cinematographer Miroslav Ondříček.    1964–1971  Black Peter is one of the first and most representative films of the Czechoslovak New Wave. It won the Golden Leopard award at the Locarno International Film Festival. It covers the first few days in the working life of a Czech teenager. In Czechoslovakia in 1964, the aimless Petr (Ladislav Jakim) starts work as a security guard in a busy self-service supermarket; unfortunately, he is so lacking in confidence that even when he sees shoplifters, he cannot bring himself to confront them. He is similarly tongue-tied with the lovely Asa (Pavla Martínková) and during the lectures about personal responsibility and the dignity of labor that his blustering father (Jan Vostrčil) delivers at home. Loves of a Blonde is one of the best–known movies of the Czechoslovak New Wave, and won awards at the Venice and Locarno film festivals. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1967. In 1967, he directed The Firemen's Ball an original Czechoslovak–Italian co-production; this was Forman's first color film. It is one of the best–known movies of the Czechoslovak New Wave. On the face of it a naturalistic representation of an ill-fated social event in a provincial town, the film has been seen by both film scholars and the then-authorities in Czechoslovakia as a biting satire on East European Communism, which resulted in it being banned for many years in Forman's home country. The Czech term zhasnout (to switch lights off), associated with petty theft in the film, was used to describe the large-scale asset stripping that occurred in the country during the 1990s.

He is best known for his arthouse work, \"Last Life in the Universe\", and is considered to be one of Thai cinema's leading \"new wave\" auteurs, alongside Wisit Sasanatieng and Apichatpong Weerasethakul.

Ruang Talok 69 (Thai: เรื่องตลก 69, English: \"6ixtynin9\" or \"A Funny Story About 6 and 9\"), is a 1999 Thai crime film written and directed by Pen-Ek Ratanaruang. It is the second feature film by the Thai writer-director. It stars Lalita Panyopas, a popular star of Thai soap operas. == Plot ==\nTum is a secretary working for a bank which is forced to shed staff. As the boss cannot bear to select which people to fire, he uses the Kau Cim to determine who must leave. Tum draws one of the unlucky numbers. Back at her apartment building, she finds the elevator is out of order and is somewhat bothered by a young man who is a little too helpful. She is nonetheless accommodating and friendly. Once alone, though, she envisions all kinds of suicidal scenarios, including drinking household cleaning chemicals or blowing her head off with a handgun.\nHer luck changes for the weirder the next morning when she discovers an instant noodle box in front of her door. It is filled with 500 baht bills. Apparently it has been left there because the number on her apartment door, 6, is missing a nail, so it flips upside down, making it appear she lives in apartment 9, which is actually down the hall. Soon after, a couple of thugs from a Muay Thai camp ask her if she has seen the box. They force their way into her flat, only to be killed accidentally.\nTum decides to get rid of their bodies, get a plane ticket, obtain a fake passport and visa, take the noodle box with her and go spend the rest of her life somewhere else. But the gangster, Kanjit, who makes fake passports happens to be the very guy she must stay away from. More men sent by a Muay Thai promoter appear at Tum's apartment, where one quickly hides in her wardrobe when she returned home. A young policeman, the lover of her nosy neighbor Pen, suddenly calls on her and discovers the bodies. The hidden man attracts the policeman's attention when he cocks his gun, and the subsequent firefight kills them both.\nAs Tum tries to hide the two bodies, Pen comes to visit, believing the policeman is still in her home. Another man arrives at the apartment later looking for the missing men, and mistakenly thinks he has killed the policeman after firing into the cop's body, which was hidden behind a door. As Tum tries to clean up the mess and hide the cop's body later, Pen and other neighbours spy on her through the keyhole and mistakenly believe she is having an affair with the policeman. Pen thinks of ways to figure out what Tum is doing, and ends up speculating the worst about her.\nThere is also Tum's friend Jim, who is distraught over her boyfriend cheating on her. Tum takes Jim with her to get her passport, and Jim accidentally gets caught in the crossfire. Jim, now dead, has been compromised and Tum makes off with the money. Tum remembers when Pen told her about how bodies were dumped in the lake and whatever goes down there disappears. She therefore dumps the money in, escaping with just guilt.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nLalita Panyopas as Tum\nBlack Phomtong as Kanjit\nTasanawalai Ongarittichai as Jim\nSirisin Siripornsmathikul as Pen\n\n\n== Remake ==\nA television remake, 6ixtynin9: The Series, premiered on Netflix in 2023. Davika Hoorne stars as Toom. Nonzee Nimibutr (Thai: นนทรีย์ นิมิบุตร, RTGS: Nonsi Nimibut; born in 1962 in Nonthaburi Province, Thailand) is a Thai film director, film producer and screenwriter. Best known for his ghost thriller, Nang Nak, he is generally credited as the leader among a \"New Wave\" of Thai filmmakers that also includes Pen-Ek Ratanaruang, Wisit Sasanatieng and Apichatpong Weerasethakul.    Biography     Education  Nonzee is a relative of Lieutenant General Phachoen Nimitbutr (เผชิญ นิมิบุตร), Director of the Signal Department of the Royal Thai Army and the founder of Thailand's first television station, Army TV Channel 5.  Nonzee graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in visual communication design from the Faculty of Decorative Arts at Silpakorn University in 1987. Classmates included Wisit Sasanatieng and production designer Ek Iemchuen. He started his career as a director of television commercials and music videos.    First films  He made his feature-film debut with 1997's Dang Bireley's and Young Gangsters, with a screenplay by Wisit Sasanatieng. The story was set in 1956 in Bangkok and follows the adventures of a gang of young criminals, with the action showing the influence of John Woo films. It was named best picture at the Thailand National Film Awards and was nominated for a Dragons and Tigers Award at the Vancouver International Film Festival. His next film was Nang Nak, a thriller based on a popular Thai ghost story, also scripted by Wisit. A famous ghost story that has been depicted in many Thai films and television series, the story is about a husband comes home from war and takes up living with his wife and newborn son who, unbeknownst to him, have died while he was away. The moodily framed horror film won numerous awards, including best picture at the Thailand National Film Awards. Both Young Gangsters and Nang Nak were hits at the box office and were credited with reinvigorating the Thai film industry.    Pan-Asian production  With his third film, Jan Dara, Nonzee began a trend of pan-Asian film production in the Thai industry, bringing in Hong Kong actress Christy Chung to star in the erotic drama. He also sought funding from studios outside Thailand. Ahead of its release, Jan Dara was controversial because its sexual subject matter, involving incest, rape and abortion, tested the bounds of Thailand's 1930 Censorship Code. The film was released with the board's cuts for the film's commercial run in Thailand, but it was available uncut for film festivals. Nonzee also became quite active as a producer, putting his name on such films as Bangkok Dangerous by the Pang Brothers; Tears of the Black Tiger by Wisit Sasanatieng; the historical battle epic, Bangrajan by Thanit Jitnukul and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang's Monrak Transistor.

        "question": "When did Prince Henry, Duke Of Cumberland And Strathearn's mother die?",
        "answer": "8 February 1772",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When did Prince Henry, Duke Of Cumberland And Strathearn's mother die?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nLavinia Jannetta Horton Ryves, née Lavinia Serres( 16 March 1797 – 7 December 1871), was a British woman claiming to be a member of the British royal family, calling herself\" Princess Lavinia of Cumberland\". Born in Liverpool, England, Lavinia was the daughter of Olivia Serres and John Thomas Serres. Olivia Serres gained notoriety by claiming to be the daughter of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, a younger brother of King George III of the United Kingdom. In 1822 Lavinia married Anthony Ryves, a portrait painter. They were divorced in 1841. In 1844\" Princess Lavinia\" tried to take Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington to court for having\" overlooked\", as George III's executor, a bequest of £ 15,000 to Olivia. In 1850 Lavinia published a pamphlet requesting financial aid from Queen Victoria. In 1866, aged sixty- nine, Princess Lavinia asked the Court of Probate to declare her the legitimate granddaughter of the Duke of Cumberland and award her the £ 15,000 bequest\" left\" by George III. In the process of the 1866 trial, Lavinia produced several remarkable documents attesting to her claims, and a handwriting expert testified to the authenticity of George III's and James Wilmot's signatures. Testimony was introduced that in fact the Duke of Kent had supported Olivia financially, and had spoken of Olivia as\" my cousin Serres\", apparently believing her story. The trial was most considered remarkable, perhaps, for the claims made by Dr. Walter Smith, Lavinia's barrister, that George III had been privately married to a Quaker, Hannah Lightfoot, and that in consequence thereof, neither George IV nor Queen Victoria had any right to the throne. Lavinia's case, however, quickly ran into difficulties: in some of the submitted documents, George III had\" signed\" his name as\" George Guelph\"; in others, William Pitt and Lord Brook had\" signed\" as earls before they had in fact become earls. The court found that Lavinia was the legitimate daughter of John and Olivia Serres and was not the granddaughter of the Duke of Cumberland. The court did not prosecute Lavinia for forgery: Lavinia maintained she believed in good faith that the documents left her by Olivia were genuine. It is thought that the documents were in fact forged at the behest of Olivia, rather than Lavinia, perhaps by William FitzClarence, Olivia's boyfriend, who had calligraphic talents. Lavinia continued to write pamphlets in support of her claims, and her case was reheard by the House of Lords. She died with her claims unrecognized. Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Victoria Franziska Antonia Juliane Luise); 14 February 1822 – 10 November 1857) was the daughter of Ferdinand, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry and Princess Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya. Her father was the second son of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and Countess Augusta Reuss of Ebersdorf. Through her father she was a first cousin to Queen Victoria as Queen Victoria's  mother was her aunt.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nBorn to Ferdinand, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry and Princess Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya. Her mother was the daughter and heiress of Ferenc József, Prince Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya. When Antonia's father died in 1826, she inherited his estates in Slovakia and Hungary. Her elder brother was King Ferdinand II of Portugal and first cousins included British Queen Victoria, her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as well as Belgian King Leopold II and his sister, Empress Carlota of Mexico.\nOn 27 April 1840, at the Château de Saint-Cloud, she married Louis d'Orléans, known since birth as the Duke of Nemours, second son of King Louis Philippe of France. After the Revolution of 1848 in France, the royal family went into exile and settled in England.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Nemours had four children, all of them having issue except the last, Blanche, who never married. Victoria was outlived by her husband, who died in 1896. She died almost two weeks after giving birth to Blanche at Claremont and was buried at the Chapel of Saint Charles Borromeo in Weybridge.  Her remains were transferred to the Royal Chapel of Dreux, the traditional burial place of the House of Orléans, in 1979.\n\n\n== Issue ==\nLouis Philippe Marie Ferdinand Gaston d'Orléans, Count of Eu (28 April 1842 – 28 August 1922), who married Isabella, eldest daughter and heiress of Dom Pedro II of Brazil;\nFerdinand Philippe Marie d'Orléans, Duke of Alençon (12 July 1844 – 29 June 1910), who married Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria (1847–1897), sister of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria, and who had been for a time engaged to Ludwig II of Bavaria;\nMarguerite Adélaïde Marie d'Orléans (1846–1893), who married Prince Ladislaus Czartoryski;\nBlanche Marie Amelie Caroline Louise Victoire d'Orléans (28 October 1857 – 4 February 1932).\n\n\n== Honours ==\n Kingdom of Portugal: Dame of the Order of Queen Saint Isabel, 22 July 1839\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duchess of Nemours at Wikimedia Commons Sir John Dunne( 1825 – 5 January 1906) was the Chief Constable of Cumberland and Westmorland Constabulary for 45 years. Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester,( born Alice Christabel Montagu Douglas Scott; 25 December 1901 – 29 October 2004) was the wife of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, the third son of King George V and Queen Mary. She was the mother of Prince William of Gloucester and Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. The daughter of the 7th Duke of Buccleuch, Scotland's largest landowner, she became by marriage a princess of the United Kingdom, and a sister- in- law to Edward VIII and George VI. She was thus an aunt by marriage to Elizabeth II. Princess Alice was extremely well travelled, both before and after her marriage. Anne, Duchess of Cumberland and Strathearn (née Luttrell, later Horton; 24 January 1743 – 28 December 1808) was a member of the British royal family, the wife of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn. Her sister was Lady Elizabeth Luttrell who was her companion and managed her home.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAnne was born in Marylebone, London and was baptized on 17 February 1742 at St Marylebone, Westminster, Middlesex, England. although another source says 24 January 1743. She was the daughter of Simon Luttrell, later first Earl of Carhampton, and his wife, Judith Maria Lawes, daughter of Sir Nicholas Lawes. Her younger sister and devoted companion, Elizabeth, was born on 3 February 1744 in London.\nHer father was a Member of the House of Commons before being created Baron Irnham in 1768, Viscount Carhampton in 1781 and Earl of Carhampton in 1785.\n\n\n== Marriages ==\nAnne was first married to a commoner, Christopher Horton (sometimes spelt Houghton) of Catton Hall, on 4 August 1765.\nShe was later widowed and subsequently married Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, the sixth child of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and a younger brother of George III. Their marriage took place at Hertford Street in Mayfair, London on 2 October 1771.\n\nGeorge III did not approve of the marriage as Anne was a commoner and previously married. He later had the Royal Marriages Act 1772 passed to prevent any descendant of George II marrying without the consent of the sovereign, a law which remained in effect until the passage of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which, in addition to several other modifications, limited the requirement to obtain royal consent to only the first six persons in line to the throne (rather than all descendants). As the Act's provisions could not be applied retroactively, Anne and the Duke's marriage was considered valid.\nThe Cumberlands moved to York House, renamed Cumberland House, on Pall Mall and lived there until the Duke's death in 1790. The house became an alternative court as the Duke was in open dispute with his mother and brother. The court was successful and Anne's sister Elizabeth Luttrell took a good share of the credit. She had been a witness at her sister's secret wedding and the couple had given her her own wing of Cumberland House. The Duke's finances were maintained by gambling tables at their home and Elizabeth managed them successfully. \nIn 1800, the widowed Duchess surrendered it to the banks who held mortgages on it.\n\n\n== Character and appearance ==\nHorace Walpole wrote \"her coquetry was so active, so varied and yet so habitual, that it was difficult not to see through it and yet as difficult to resist it\". While she was generally considered a great beauty, Walpole thought her merely \"pretty\", except for her green eyes, which he admitted were enchanting. That her eyes were remarkably expressive is confirmed by the several portraits of Anne by Thomas Gainsborough, one of which is in the Hugh Lane collection.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPortraits of Anne Horton at the National Portrait Gallery, London Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (Edward Augustus; 2 November 1767 – 23 January 1820) was the fourth son and fifth child of King George III and Queen Charlotte. His only child, Victoria, became Queen of the United Kingdom 17 years after his death. Prince Edward was created Duke of Kent and Strathearn and Earl of Dublin on 23 April 1799 and, a few weeks later, appointed a General and commander-in-chief of British forces in the Maritime Provinces of North America. On 23 March 1802, he was appointed Governor of Gibraltar and nominally retained that post until his death. The Duke was appointed Field-Marshal of the Forces on 3 September 1805. Edward lived in Lower Canada and Nova Scotia from 1791 to 1800. He is credited with the first use of the term Canadian to mean both French and English settlers in the Canadas, using the term to quell a riot between the two groups at a polling station in Charlesbourg on 27 June 1792. In the 21st century, he has been styled the \"Father of the Canadian Crown\" for his contribution to the development of Canada. Edward was also the first British prince to enter the United States since the recognition of American independence in 1783, travelling to Boston on foot from Lower Canada in 1794.     Early life  Prince Edward was born on 2 November 1767 to King George III and Queen Charlotte. He was fourth in the line of succession to the British throne. He was named after his uncle Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, who had died several weeks earlier and was buried at Westminster Abbey the day before Edward's birth. Edward was baptised on 30 November 1767; his godparents were the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Lüneburg (his paternal uncle by marriage, for whom the Earl of Hertford, Lord Chamberlain, stood proxy), Duke Charles of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (his maternal uncle, for whom the Earl of Huntingdon, Groom of the Stole, stood proxy), the Hereditary Princess of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (his paternal aunt, who was represented by a proxy) and the Landgravine of Hesse-Kassel (his paternal grandfather's sister, for whom Elizabeth, Marchioness of Lorne, Lady of the Bedchamber to the Queen, stood proxy).  \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t    Military career     Army  The Prince began his military training in the Electorate of Hanover in 1785. King George III intended to send him to the University of Göttingen, but decided against it upon the advice of the Duke of York. Instead, Edward went to Lüneburg and later Hanover, accompanied by his German tutor, Lieutenant Colonel George von Wangenheim, Baron Wangenheim. On 30 May 1786, he was appointed a brevet colonel in the British Army. From 1788 to 1789, he completed his education in Geneva. On 5 August 1789, aged 22, he became a mason in L'Union, the most important Genevan masonic lodge in the 19th century. In 1789, he was appointed colonel of the 7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers). In 1790, he returned home without leave and, in disgrace, was sent off to Gibraltar as an ordinary officer. He was joined from Marseilles by Madame de Saint-Laurent.    Quebec   Due to the extreme Mediterranean heat, Edward requested to be transferred to present-day Canada, specifically Quebec, in 1791. Edward arrived in Canada in time to witness the proclamation of the Constitutional Act of 1791, became the first member of the Royal Family to tour Upper Canada, and became a fixture of British North American society. Edward and his mistress, Julie St. Laurent, became close friends with the French Canadian family of Ignace-Michel-Louis-Antoine d'Irumberry de Salaberry; the Prince mentored all of the family's sons throughout their military careers. Edward guided Charles de Salaberry throughout his career, and made sure that the famous commander was duly honoured after his leadership during the Battle of Chateauguay. The prince was promoted to the rank of major-general in October 1793. He served successfully in the West Indies campaign the following year, and was commander of the British camp at La Coste during the Battle of Martinique, for which he was mentioned in dispatches by General Charles Grey for his \"great Spirit and Activity\". He subsequently received the thanks of Parliament.    Nova Scotia   After 1794, Prince Edward lived at the headquarters of the Royal Navy's North American Station located in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Sibylle Calma Marie Alice Bathildis Feodora; 18 January 1908 – 28 November 1972) was a member of the Swedish royal family and the mother of the current king of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf. Born into the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Sibylla was the daughter of Charles Edward, the last duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. She became a Swedish princess when she married Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten in 1932. She thus had the prospect of one day becoming queen, but the prince was killed in an airplane crash in 1947 and did not live to ascend the Swedish throne. Her son became king the year after her death.    Early life   Sibylla was born on 18 January 1908 at Schloss Friedenstein in the city of Gotha, one of the two capitals in the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in central Germany. She was the elder daughter and second child of Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein. Her father was a posthumous son of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, the youngest son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Prince Charles Edward had, at the urging of his grandmother, inherited the position of duke after his uncle in 1900. The same year he had married Princess Victoria Adelaide, who was a daughter of Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, sister of the Empress Augusta Victoria. Like the other princes of the German Empire, her father was forced to abdicate in November 1918, just before the end of World War I, when the German monarchies were abolished amidst the tumults of the German Revolution of 1918–1919. This also affected Princess Sibylla's position. In 1919, her father was deprived of his British peerages, as a consequence of the Titles Deprivation Act of 1917, which authorized enemies of the United Kingdom during the First World War to be deprived of their British peerages and royal titles. He and his children also lost their entitlement to the titles of Prince and Princess of the United Kingdom and the styles of Royal Highness and Highness. Princess Sibylla grew up in Coburg with her siblings Hereditary Prince Johann Leopold, Prince Hubertus, Princess Caroline-Mathilde and Prince Friedrich Josias. The children received, as was common in aristocratic circles at the time, their initial schooling by private tutors and governesses. Later, Princess Sibylla attended the Gymnasium Alexandrinum in Coburg and the Kunstgewerbeschule in Weimar.    Marriage   In November 1931, Sibylla was in London to attend the wedding of her paternal first cousin Lady May Cambridge as a bridesmaid. One of the other bridesmaids was her second cousin Princess Ingrid of Sweden, who introduced Sibylla to her brother, Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten. Their engagement was announced at Callenberg Castle in Coburg 16 June 1932. Prince Gustaf Adolf was the eldest son of Crown Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden (later King Gustaf VI Adolf) and Princess Margaret of Connaught, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Sibylla and Gustaf Adolf were thus second cousins, as they were both great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria.     The wedding took place in Coburg in October of the same year - known as the \"Sweden Year\", as in the same year the 300th-anniversary of the death of the great Swedish King Gustavus II Adolphus was marked. Although the monarchy had been abolished, the wedding was still celebrated in an official manner in Coburg, with, among other things, military honors and a public procession, as the German President Paul von Hindenburg had ordered that no honours should be spared. However, as the city of Coburg was already strongly dominated by the Nazi party at the time, the official celebrations there were Nazi influenced, which made a very bad impression in Sweden. On 19 October, Princess Sibylla married Prince Gustaf Adolf in a civil ceremony at the Veste Coburg, followed by a church wedding the following day after, at the St. Moriz Church. The couple spent their honeymoon in Italy before arriving in Stockholm on 25 November 1932. The couple had five children:  Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler (born 31 October 1934) married John Ambler on 30 June 1964. Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (– 8 February 1772) was Princess of Wales by marriage to Frederick, Prince of Wales. She was one of only four Princesses of Wales who never became queen consort, as her eldest son succeeded her father-in-law as George III of the United Kingdom in 1760 rather than her spouse, who had died nine years earlier. Augusta was presumptive regent of Great Britain in the event of a regency between the death of her spouse in 1751, until the majority of her son in 1756, though in the event her father-in-law, George II, lived until 1760. Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (30 November [O.S. 19 November] 1719 – 8 February 1772) was Princess of Wales by marriage to Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son and heir apparent of King George II. She never became queen consort, as Frederick predeceased his father in 1751. Augusta's eldest son succeeded her father-in-law as George III in 1760. After her spouse died, Augusta was the presumptive regent of Great Britain in the event of a regency, until her son reached majority in 1756.    Early life  Princess Augusta was born in Gotha to Frederick II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1676–1732) and Magdalena Augusta of Anhalt-Zerbst (1679–1740). Her paternal grandfather was Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, eldest surviving son of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. In 1736, it was proposed that she marry 29-year-old Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of George II of Great Britain and his queen consort Caroline of Ansbach. Originally, Frederick was intended to marry the eldest daughter of the King of Prussia. A marriage alliance between Great Britain and Prussia had been an ambition for many years. However, when George II suggested that his eldest son would marry the eldest (unmarried) daughter of the King of Prussia, while his second (unmarried) daughter would marry the eldest son of the Prussian king, the King of Prussia demanded that his eldest son should likewise marry the eldest (unmarried) daughter of the King of Great Britain, and George II refused to agree to this demand. Around the time the Prussian plan was cancelled, there were rumours that Frederick might marry Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford, granddaughter of the Duchess of Marlborough, and that such a marriage had been proposed when he visited the duchess's lodge at Richmond. Queen Caroline felt a need to arrange a marriage for her son quickly, to preempt any possibility of such a mésalliance. She therefore suggested to the king that, when he next visited the Electorate of Hanover, he should also visit Saxe-Gotha and view the princesses there. The king did so, and informed the queen that he considered Augusta suitable. When the matter was broached with Frederick, he simply replied that he would accept any bride his father decided was suitable for him. His attitude arose from a desire to obtain an additional allowance from Parliament to be financially independent of his father. Augusta did not speak French or English, and it was suggested that she be given lessons before the wedding, but her mother did not consider it necessary, as the British royal family were from Germany. She arrived in Britain, speaking virtually no English, aged 16, for a wedding ceremony which took place almost immediately, on 8 May [O.S. 27 April] 1736, at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, London.    Princess of Wales   Augusta of Saxe-Gotha left Hellevoetsluis 17 April 1736 and arrived at Greenwich on the royal yacht William and Mary on the 25th, where she was welcomed by her groom. On 27 April 1736, she was escorted to St James's Palace, London, where she met the rest of the royal family. When she was introduced to the royal family, she made a favourable impression on the king and queen by throwing herself on the floor before them in a gesture of respect. The wedding ceremony was held at the Royal Chapel inside St. James's Palace the same day (27 April O.S., 8 May N.S.) During the first year of marriage, Augusta could be seen playing with her doll in the windows of her residence, until her sister-in-law, Princess Caroline, told her to stop. Frederick took advantage of her inexperience when he had his then lover, Lady Archibald Hamilton, employed as her First Lady of the Bedchamber, after convincing Augusta that there was no truth in the rumour of his affair. Augusta and Frederick had nine children, the last born after Frederick's death. Frederick once stated that he would never allow himself to be influenced by his consort as his father was, and he thus never made Augusta his confidante. He did, however, instruct her to act in accordance with his wishes in his feud with his parents, and on several occasions, Frederick reportedly instructed her to snub them. When she attended the service of the German Lutheran Chapel, for example, which was also attended by the queen, Frederick instructed Augusta to make sure she always arrived after the queen, so that she would be forced to push in front of the queen to reach her place. Lady Almeria Carpenter( 1752 – 1809) was a British courtier and mistress of Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh. Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (25 November 1743 – 25 August 1805), was a grandson of George II and a younger brother of George III of the United Kingdom.    Life     Youth   Prince William Henry was born at Leicester House, Westminster. His parents were Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of George II and Caroline of Ansbach, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, then Princess of Wales. He was baptized at Leicester House eleven days later. His godparents were his paternal uncle by marriage, the Prince of Orange; his paternal uncle, the Duke of Cumberland; and his paternal aunt, Princess Amelia. He was fourth in the line of succession at birth. His father died in 1751, leaving the Prince's elder brother, Prince George, heir-apparent to the throne. He succeeded as George III on 25 October 1760, and created William Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh and Earl of Connaught on 19 November 1764. He had been made a Knight of the Garter on 27 May 1762, and invested on 22 September of that year. In 1764, he began to court Maria Walpole, the Dowager Countess of Waldegrave, an illegitimate granddaughter of Sir Robert Walpole.    Career and marriage   He initially wished for active service in the military, but his health and intelligence both proved insufficient. Instead he was appointed colonel of the 13th Regiment of Foot in 1766. That same year, he and Maria married in secret in his home on Pall Mall. This marriage only became known to the King after the passing of the Royal Marriages Act 1772. The Duke and Maria lived at St Leonard's Hill in Clewer, near Windsor and had three children, all of whom were styled Highness from birth and used the territorial designation of Gloucester in conjunction with their princely styles, as great-grandchildren in the male line of George II. In 1767, he was promoted to major-general and made colonel of the 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards. The same year he was made Warden of Windsor Forest, gaining the post's official residence at Cranbourne Lodge. In 1768, he employed the renowned violin maker Richard Duke as his official instrument maker; giving him private lodgings in Old Gloucester Street and workshops in Gloucester Place. He was made the thirteenth Chancellor of the University of Dublin in 1771, holding the post until 1805.  The Duke and Maria had three children:  Princess Sophia of Gloucester (Sophia Matilda; 29 May 1773 – 29 November 1844), was born in 1773. Princess Caroline of Gloucester(Caroline Augusta Maria; 24 June 1774 – 14 March 1775) Christened privately on 22 July 1774 – her godparents were the Duchess of Gloucester (her mother), the Hereditary Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg (her paternal aunt) and the Hereditary Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (her uncle by marriage). However, Princess Caroline died aged just nine months following a smallpox inoculation, intended to protect her from the disease. Prince William Frederick (15 January 1776 – 30 November 1834) With the outbreak of the American War of Independence, the Duke hoped for a field command, but George refused. He made a request to serve in the forces of Frederick II of Prussia during the War of Bavarian Succession (1777–1779) – George consented but Frederick himself turned down the offer. He later transferred to the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, and he became a field marshal on 18 October 1793. He went on to be General Officer Commanding Northern District in 1796, a command that he held until 1802.    Interests and family connections   In 1780, the Duke was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and remained interested in medical and scientific matters of the day. In 1797, he  invited  Norwich surgeon  Philip Meadows Martineau  to dine with him at  Raynham Hall, the home of  the George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend whose first cousin was Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney, after whom Sydney, Australia was named. Martineau's first cousin, Lt. David Blackburn (1753–1795)) had helped establish the first settlement at Sydney Cove having been   Master of HMS Supply,  a ship of the  First Fleet. The Marquess, like Martineau was a Whig and, at this time,  Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk. Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (German: Viktoria Adelheid Helene Luise Marie Friederike; 31 December 1885 – 3 October 1970) was Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as the consort of Duke Charles Edward from their marriage on 11 October 1905 until his abdication on 14 November 1918. Victoria Adelaide's marriage to Charles Edward was arranged by German emperor, Wilhelm II. She was chosen for her perceived political loyalty to the Imperial German government and her symbolic significance as a German wife for the British-born duke. She was seen as unpretentious and gained popularity among the people of the Duchy. After his forced abdication in 1918, Charles Edward became an enthusiastic supporter of Nazism. Sources differ on how enthusiastically Victoria Adelaide supported these beliefs.    Early life   Princess Victoria Adelaide was born on 31 December 1885 at Castle Grünholz, Thumby, Schleswig-Holstein, Prussia as the eldest daughter of Frederick Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and his wife Princess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg.  Victoria Adelaide's mother was a sister of Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, who became the German Empress by marriage to Wilhelm II. Also, Victoria Adelaide's father was the eldest son of Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and a nephew of Christian IX of Denmark. One month before the birth of Victoria Adelaide, Friedrich Ferdinand had succeeded to the headship of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and the title of duke upon the death of his father on 27 November 1885. A report in the Alcester Chronicle, a British local newspaper, published in 1909, commented that Victoria Adelaide and her sisters had been allowed by their father to learn a women's occupation in case they ever needed to support themselves. According to the report, Victoria Adelaide had gained a qualification from the \"Berlin Royal School of Cookery\".    Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha   On 11 October 1905, at Glücksburg Castle, Schleswig, she married Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Charles Edward was the only son of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany by his wife Princess Helena of Waldeck and a grandson of Queen Victoria. Five years before the marriage, he had succeeded to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha upon the death of his uncle Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1900. As Charles Edward was considered to have an \"ambiguous\" attitude towards women, according to historian Karena Urbach, his family decided he needed an arranged marriage at a young age. Victoria Adelaide was chosen by her uncle Wilhelm II, the German Emperor, as the bride of Charles Edward. She was believed to be well-adjusted and loyal to Wilhelm's royal house. She lacked any Non-German or Jewish ancestry which was seen as important as her new husband was British-born. The local newspaper commented that the people of the Duchy \"will always prefer to welcome a princess born into their own tribe as mother of the country [Duchess] than a stranger\"  Victoria Adelaide was described, in her grandson's memoirs, as the leading part of the marriage and the Duke would initially come to her for advice.  Victoria Adelaide was well-liked and seen as open to ordinary people.  She often walked around her husband's territories talking to people and knew many members of the local population. She and her husband had five children born between 1906 and 1918: Prince Johann Leopold (1906—1972), Princess Sibylla (1908—1972), Prince Hubertus (1909—1943), Princess Caroline Mathilde (1912—1983), and Prince Friedrich Josias (1918—1998). As was the norm among families of their social class at the time, caring for the children was mainly delegated to domestic servants. The family often spoke English at home.    Later life   In 1918, the Duke was forced to abdicate his ducal throne, following the end of World War I, forcing the family to become private citizens. Charles Edward was an early and fervent supporter of Adolf Hitler. At a 1929 local election in Coburg, Victoria Adelaide attended Nazi party campaign events alongside her husband. According to some accounts, she initially shared her husband's enthusiasm and patriotism but came to loathe the Nazi Party following the Nazi seizure of power. She defied her husband by supporting the German Evangelical Church Confederation against the antisemitic German Christians. Ann Elliot( 16 November 1743 – 30 May 1769) was a British courtesan and actress. She appeared in comedies in London and Dublin. She had relationships with her mentor Arthur Murphy, with Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol and with Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland. Walter John Montagu Douglas Scott, 8th Duke of Buccleuch and 10th Duke of Queensberry,( 30 December 1894 – 4 October 1973) was a Scottish peer and Conservative politician. He was the son of John Montagu Douglas Scott, 7th Duke of Buccleuch and Lady Margaret Alice\" Molly\" Bridgeman. His sister, Alice, married Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester( one of the paternal uncles of Queen Elizabeth II) in 1935, becoming a member of the British Royal Family. Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain that was conferred upon a member of the British royal family. It was named after the county of Cumberland in England, and after Strathearn in Scotland.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe title of Duke of Cumberland had been created three times in the Peerages of England and Great Britain.\nThe title of Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn was created on 22 October 1766 in the Peerage of Great Britain. This double dukedom and the Earldom of Dublin in the Peerage of Ireland were bestowed on Prince Henry, the third son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and grandson of King George II. Since Prince Henry died without legitimate children, the title became extinct.\nThe title of Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale was later created in the Peerage of Great Britain.\n\n\n== List of titleholders ==\n\n\n=== Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn (1766) === Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn (Henry Frederick; 7 November 1745 – 18 September 1790) was the sixth child and fourth son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and a younger brother of George III. His 1771 marriage to a commoner against the King's wishes prompted the Royal Marriages Act of 1772 . Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn (Henry Frederick; 7 November 1745 – 18 September 1790) was the sixth child and fourth son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and a younger brother of George III.  His 1771 marriage to a commoner against the King's wishes prompted the Royal Marriages Act 1772.    Early life   Prince Henry was born on 7 November 1745 at Leicester House, London, to Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of George II and Caroline of Ansbach, and his wife Augusta, the Princess of Wales. He was christened at Leicester House twenty-three days later. He was a duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg from birth.    Royal Dukedom   On 22 October 1766, just prior to his twenty-first birthday, the prince was created Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn and Earl of Dublin. He was Ranger of Windsor Forest and Great Park, from 1766 to 1790. He became a Privy Councillor in 1766 and was appointed Knight of the Garter the following year (1767).    Allegations  On 4 March 1767, the Duke of Cumberland allegedly married Olive Wilmot (later Mrs Payne), a commoner, in a secret ceremony. There reportedly was one child, Olivia Wilmot (1772–1834), from this relationship, though the duke's paternity was never proven, and a jury found unanimously that Olivia Wilmot had forged the evidence. A landscape painter and novelist, Olivia Wilmot married John Thomas Serres (1759–1825) and later, controversially, assumed the title of \"Princess Olivia of Cumberland\". Cumberland's mistresses included Ann Elliot who had been an actress before another had taken her off the stage. Cumberland set her up in a house in Greek Street in Soho where she died after an illness in 1769. Cumberland arranged for her burial and memorial and gave a large sum to her estate. In 1769, the Duke of Cumberland was sued by Lord Grosvenor for \"criminal conversation\" (that is, adultery) after the Duke and Lady Grosvenor were discovered in flagrante delicto.  Lord Grosvenor was awarded damages of £10,000, which together with costs amounted to an award of £13,000 (equivalent to £2,280,000 in 2023).    Royal Navy  In 1768, at the fairly late age of 22, the Duke entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman and was sent to Corsica in HMS Venus. However, he returned in September when the ship was recalled following the French invasion of the Corsican Republic. He was promoted to Rear-Admiral the following year and Vice-Admiral in 1770.    Marriage  On 2 October 1771, the Duke married Anne Horton (1743–1808), daughter of Irish peer and British MP Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton (then Lord Irnham) and the widow of Christopher Horton of Catton Hall. The marriage caused a rift with the King, who considered it a mismatch, and was the catalyst for the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which forbade any descendant of George II to marry without the monarch's permission. The marriage between Anne Horton and the Duke of Cumberland was described as a \"conquest at Brighthelmstone\" (now Brighton) by Mrs. Horton, \"who\", Horace Walpole says, \"had for many months been dallying with his passion, till she had fixed him to more serious views than he had intended\". Anne was however generally thought one of the great beauties of the age (even Walpole found her green eyes \"enchanting\"), and Thomas Gainsborough painted her several times.    Later life  In 1775, the Duke established the Cumberland Fleet, which would later become the Royal Thames Yacht Club. He was promoted vice-admiral of the White in 1776, admiral of the Blue in 1778, and admiral of the White in 1782, though he was forbidden from assuming any command. The Duke was also instrumental in the development of Brighton as a popular resort. He had first visited in 1771, and in 1783, the Prince of Wales visited his uncle there. The Duke of Cumberland died in London on 18 September 1790. Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Alexandra Louise Olga Victoria; 1 September 1878 – 16 April 1942) was the fourth child and third daughter of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia. As the wife of Ernst II, she was Princess consort of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. She was a granddaughter of both Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Tsar Alexander II of Russia.    Early life  Alexandra was born Princess Alexandra of Edinburgh on 1 September 1878 at Rosenau Castle, Coburg. Her father was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second-eldest son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her mother was Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, the only surviving daughter of Alexander II of Russia and Marie of Hesse and by Rhine. She was baptised Alexandra Louise Olga Victoria on 2 October 1878 at Edinburgh Palace, Coburg, presumably by her mother's chaplain. Her godparents included her maternal uncle Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia. During Alexandra's formative years, her father, occupied with his career in the Navy and later as a ruler in Coburg, paid little attention to his family. It was Alexandra's mother who was the domineering presence in their children's life. Alexandra had four siblings: Alfred, Marie, Victoria Melita, and Beatrice (her only younger sibling). Throughout her life, Alexandra was usually overshadowed by her elder sisters; she was considered less beautiful and more subdued than Marie and Victoria Melita.  Nicknamed 'Sandra' by her family, Alexandra spent her childhood first in England, then from  1886 to 1889 in Malta, where her father was serving with the British Navy. In 1889 the family moved to Coburg, Germany, as her father was the heir apparent to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. She was a bridesmaid at the 1885 wedding of her aunt Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom to Prince Henry of Battenberg, and at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of York in 1893. That year, her great-uncle, The Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (brother of her paternal grandfather, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha) died without issue. As Prince Albert had passed away, and her uncle the Prince of Wales had renounced his claim to the duchy, the ducal throne fell to the Duke of Edinburgh. Following her father's succession, though Alexandra remained a British princess, she took the title of Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.    Marriage    Alexandra's mother, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, believed in marrying her daughters young, before they began to think for themselves. At the end of 1895, she arranged Alexandra's engagement to Ernst, Hereditary Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (13 September 1863 – 11 December 1950). Alexandra's grandmother, Queen Victoria, complained that she was too young. Alexandra's father objected to the status of his future son-in-law, who would become the 7th Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg. The House of Hohenlohe-Langenburg was mediatized — a formerly ruling family who had ceded their sovereign rights to others while (in theory) retaining their equal birth; it was not considered a brilliant match. The couple were also related: Ernst was a grandson of Princess Feodora of Leiningen, Queen Victoria's half-sister. The wedding took place on 20 April 1896 in Coburg, Germany. Alexandra was 17 and Ernst 32. They had five children:  Prince Gottfried, 8th Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (24 March 1897 – 11 May 1960); married Princess Margarita of Greece and Denmark, the eldest sister of the future Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and had issue. Princess Marie Melita of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (18 January 1899 – 8 November 1967); married Wilhelm Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and had issue. Princess Alexandra Beatrice Leopoldine of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (2 April 1901 – 26 October 1963) Princess Irma Helene of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (4 July 1902 – 8 March 1986) Prince Alfred Christian of Hohenlohe-Langenburg  (16 April 1911 – 18 April 1911)    Later life  Alexandra lived for the rest of her life in Germany. General Henry Lawes Luttrell, 2nd Earl of Carhampton PC( 7 August 1743 – 25 April 1821) was a politician and soldier. He was the son of Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton, and brother- in- law of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn. Anne, Duchess of Cumberland and Strathearn( née Anne Luttrell, later Horton; 24 January 1743 – 28 December 1808) was a member of the British Royal Family, the wife of Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Plot  Karan (Jay Bhanushali) is a singer/musician who moves into a new house in Mumbai along with his friends. He often helps his sister Radhika (Shivani Tanksale) and Andy (VJ Andy), her colleague (both are fashion photographers), with music for their fashion shows. Radhika wants to get her friend Meera (Sunny Leone) for her fashion shows in India but Meera is reluctant. Hence, Radhika with the help of Andy tricks her to travel to India by making her drunk. After they arrive in India, Meera discovers the truth and gets angry. Meanwhile, her mood changes as she sees Rajasthani girls playing a traditional game and starts to play with them, forgetting her plight. While in India, Meera meets royalty - Ranveer Singh (Mohit Ahlawat), a Rajput prince, in Rajasthan. The two eventually fall in love and get married. The prince is in the middle of a property dispute with his cousin, Bikram Singh (Jas Arora). Meanwhile, Karan has persistent dreams of someone whipping him and many times he wakes up from his sleep loudly shouting \"Leela! Leela!\". In an attempt to figure out why, his friends take him to a Pandit (Naadi palm leaf reader) who tells him that his pain is rooted in his past life of 300 years ago. With the help of the Pandit, Karan travels through his past and they find out that he must be Shravan (Rajneesh Duggal), who was in love with a girl called Leela (also played by Leone) but his master, an artist, Bhairao (Rahul Dev) adopts her as his muse. Bhairao makes a statue of Leela and discovers that Leela is in love with Shravan. In a fit of rage, Bhairao kills both Shravan and Leela by pushing them into a pit of fire. With advice from Pandit, Karan gets some courage to visit a place called Bhairao Virajana (the place of dispute between Ranveer and Bikram, who know that a statue of \"Leela\" is hidden in the midst of its ruins, which is worth a billion dollars. Bikram finds out that Karan is trespassing on his property and brings him to Prince Ranveer to inform him that their property is now being invaded by strangers. Inside the palace, Karan meets Meera and tries to remind her about their past but Meera does not believe him. Karan plays a song \"Tere Bin\" that takes Meera back into their past and she recollects her past life as the beautiful Leela... Bikram overhears the entire conversation and knows that the location of Leela's statue can be learnt by kidnapping Karan and Meera and forcing them to spill the beans. With the help of his some henchmen, Meera and Karan get kidnapped by Bikram who is looking for the statue that Bhairao had made. The current market value of the statue is $10 billion and Bikram wants to keep the money for himself. Bikram starts harassing Meera so that she would tell him where the statue is hidden. Therefore under duress and to save Meera, Karan reveals that the statue was hidden behind a wall, and then when Bikram gets to the statue, Prince Ranveer arrives and stabs Bikram's hand with a sword. In the end, Karan realizes that he is actually the reincarnation of Bhairao and not of Shravan (who has reincarnated as Ranveer).

Early life  Kusturica was born in Bosnia Sarajevo, the son of Murat Kusturica, a journalist employed at Sarajevo's Secretariat of Information, and Senka (née Numankadić), a court secretary. Emir grew up as the only child of a Muslim secular family in Sarajevo, the capital of PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, then a constituent republic within FPR Yugoslavia. As he writes in 1993, his father's mother was \"strongly tied to Muslim rites\" while his father \"did not belong to any cult, he was not religious at all\". Kusturica primarily defined himself as Yugoslavian at least until the year 2000. A lively youth, Kusturica was by his own admission a borderline delinquent while growing up in the Sarajevo neighbourhood of Gorica. Through his father's friendship with the well-known director Hajrudin \"Šiba\" Krvavac, Kusturica, aged seventeen, got a small part in Krvavac's Walter Defends Sarajevo, a 1972 partisan film funded by the Yugoslav state.    Work  In 1978, Kusturica graduated from the film school (FAMU) at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, which is why he is sometimes considered a part of the Prague film school, an informal group of Yugoslav film directors who studied at FAMU and shared similar influences and aesthetics.

He was also art director of Open Stage Obala (Otvorena scena Obala).  Kusturica's second feature film, When Father Was Away on Business (1985), earned a Palme d'Or at Cannes and five Yugoslav movie awards, as well as a nomination for an American Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.

In 1989 he was a member of the jury at the 16th Moscow International Film Festival.    1990s  Kusturica continued to make highly regarded films into the next decade, including his American debut, the absurdist comedy Arizona Dream (1993).  He won the Palme d'Or for his black comedy epic Underground (1995), based upon a scenario of Dušan Kovačević, a noted Serbian playwright. Kusturica and his work have provoked controversy at home and abroad.

He was named after his paternal uncle, a typographer and compositor, who perished in 1943 at the Jasenovac concentration camp. The Sidran family roots trace back to the hamlet Biograd near Nevesinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Abdulah's paternal grandfather Hasan Sidran relocated to Sarajevo from Belgrade in 1903.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nAfter spending most of his life in Sarajevo, Sidran lived in Goražde before moving to a small village near Tešanj.\nIn 2019, Sidran, together with some thirty world intellectuals met with French president Emmanuel Macron.

Plot  In the morning of 6 April 1941 in Belgrade, the capital of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, two bon vivants, Petar Popara, nicknamed Crni (Blacky) and Marko Dren, head home. They pass through Kalemegdan and shout salutes to Marko's brother Ivan, an animal keeper in the Belgrade Zoo. Marko lets Blacky's pregnant wife Vera know that they enrolled Blacky in the Communist Party (KPJ).    Part One: War  The hungover Blacky eats breakfast while Vera complains about his supposed affair with a theatre actress. After the roar of the planes is heard, German bombs begin falling on Belgrade. After the air raid is over, Blacky goes out against Vera's wishes and inspects the devastated city. Encountering ruins and escaped animals from the zoo, he also runs into disconsolate Ivan carrying Soni, a baby chimp. The Royal Yugoslav Army's resistance is broken, and German troops occupy and dismember the Kingdom. Blacky starts operating clandestinely as a communist activist along with Marko and others. Blacky occasionally visits his mistress Natalija Zovkov who has been assigned to a special actors' labour brigade that is helping the city's rebuilding effort under German occupational control. A celebrated actress in the National Theatre, Natalija has caught the eye of Franz, a high-ranking German officer. Marko has set up a weapons stash in the cellar of his grandfather's house. Following their interception of a trainload of weapons, Marko and Blacky are identified as dangerous bandits in German radio bulletins. While Blacky hides in the woods as Germans are intensifying door-to-door raids, Marko takes Vera, Ivan and others into the cellar to hide. Vera is due and gives birth to a baby boy, who she names Jovan before dying. In 1944, Blacky is in town to celebrate Jovan's birthday at a communist hangout. The two best friends head for the theatre and see Natalija performing on stage in front of Franz and other German officers. Blacky shoots Franz in the chest and, along with Natalija and Marko, reaches the river boat anchored outside Belgrade. There, they all get ready for a forced wedding despite Natalija's protestations. The party is interrupted by German soldiers surrounding the boat. Franz yells, demanding Blacky and Marko release Natalija, who runs to him. Blacky is captured by Germans and tortured in a hospital with electric shocks while Franz and Natalija visit her brother Bata there. Meanwhile, Marko finds a way to enter the building through an underground sewer passage. Sneaking up on Franz, Marko strangles him to death with a cord in front of Natalija who switches sides once again. Marko then proceeds to free Blacky. They leave with fatigued Blacky hidden in a suitcase, but he is injured by a grenade. Days later on Easter 1944, Marko and Natalija, now a couple, watch a comatose Blacky. In late October, the Red Army accompanied by Yugoslav Partisans enters Belgrade. Marko gives speeches from the National Theater balcony during the Trieste crisis, socializes with Josip Broz Tito, Ranković and Edvard Kardelj, and stands next to Tito during military parades through downtown Belgrade.    Part Two: Cold War  In 1961, Marko is one of Tito's closest associates and advisors. The physically recovered Blacky and company are still in the cellar under the impression that the War is still going on above.

Davor Dujmović (20 September 1969 – 31 May 1999) was a Yugoslavian actor best known for his memorable roles in Emir Kusturica's movies as Mirza in When Father Was Away on Business, Perhan in Time of the Gypsies and Bata in Underground.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBorn into a poor working-class family, Dujmović's acting career started purely by chance in 1984 when Miroslav Mandić, one of Emir Kusturica's assistant directors in charge of casting roles for When Father Was Away on Business, approached the youngster about being in the movie. The chance run-in took place at Dalmacija, a kafana near Sarajevo's Markale farmers' market, where Dujmović happened to be while visiting his father who had been operating a produce stand there. Upon seeing fourteen-year-old Davor in public, Kusturica's AD Mandić immediately thought the pubescent could potentially be perfect for the role of Mirza, the older son in the movie. After jointly convincing the teenager's father to let him audition, Kusturica and Mandić arranged a screen test that Dujmović aced and got the role.\nFollowing the film's great critical acclaim and commercial success, Dujmović attempted to enroll at Sarajevo's Academy of Performing Arts (ASU) under the dean tenure of Boro Stjepanović. However, after getting rejected at the audition, the youngster got discouraged and never tried again. He continued getting film roles, though, such as the one in Zlatko Lavanić's (another one of Kusturica's ADs) directorial debut Strategija švrake. Kusturica also continued working with Dujmović, giving him a lead in Time of the Gypsies — a 1988 movie that would make twenty-year-old Davor well known across former Yugoslavia for his indelible portrayal of a young Gypsy named Perhan. He also started doing theatre, appearing in 1989 alongside Haris Burina, Maja Mijatović, and Jelena Čović in Mjesečeva predstava, a play put together by Mladen Materić at Otvorena scena Obala, a theater founded by Materić a few years earlier.\nThe role of Perhan made Dujmović a recognizable star and ensured film roles would continue coming his way — Adam ledolomak, Aleksa Šantić, Belle epoque - Posljednji valcer u Sarajevu, Sarajevske priče, Prokleta je Amerika. During this time he also became a cast member for the third season of the Yugoslav comedy TV sketch show Top lista nadrealista, which aired in late 1991.\nSimultaneously, during the early 1990s, Davor started using hard drugs and quickly developed into a full-fledged heroin addict. During the first months of the war he stayed in Sarajevo, but later moved to Belgrade where he rejoined old friends, filming Underground with Kusturica as well as Složna braća TV series with Nele Karajlić. He unsuccessfully tried to kick his drug habit several times. At the end of the war, he moved to Banja Luka where he met up with Andrej J. Gartner with whom he started the Culture of Republika Srpska trust fund. He spent his last months with his girlfriend in Slovenia.\nDavor Dujmović committed suicide by hanging on 31 May 1999, following severe depression. His last days were spent in the Slovenian town of Novo Mesto.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nWhen Father Was Away on Business (1985) as Brother Mirza\nStrategija švrake (1987)\nTime of the Gypsies (1988) as Perhan\nIstočno od istoka (1990)\nAdam ledolomak (1990)\nBelle epoque - Posljednji valcer u Sarajevu (1990) as Gavrilo Princip\nTop lista nadrealista (TV series, 1990–91) as various characters\nPraznik u Sarajevu (1991)\nSarajevske priče (TV series, 1991) as Boban Kokot\nProkleta je Amerika (1992)\nAleksa Šantić (TV series, 1992)\nSložna braća (TV series, 1995) as Mustafa \"Mute\" Halimić\nUnderground (1996) as Bata\n\n\n== External links ==\nDavor Dujmovic Memorial page\nDavor Dujmović at IMDb Naresh Kumar may refer to:\n\nNaresh Kumar HN, Indian film director and a screenwriter who works in Kannada cinema\nNaresh Kumar (tennis) (1928–2022), Indian tennis player\nNaresh Kumar Shad (1927–1969), Urdu Ghazal and writer of Qat'aa and Rubai\nNaresh Kumar (wrestler) (born 1965), Indian wrestler who competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics\nNareish Kumar, Fiji Indian politician\nNaresh Kumar (CRPF officer), Indian police officer The No Smoking Orchestra, frequently credited as Emir Kusturica and the No Smoking Orchestra, was a Serbian garage rock band formed in Belgrade in 1993. The band was formed in 1993 by Nele Karajlić who, after relocating to Belgrade from Sarajevo, decided to revive Zabranjeno Pušenje, a band he co-founded with Sejo Sexon in 1980 that had at that point been dormant since 1990. Initially, the band performed as Zabranjeno Pušenje, but ultimately changed the name to Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra when renowned filmmaker Emir Kusturica (who had previously played with the band in 1987) re-joined it in 1998.    History  During the Bosnian War, Nele Karajlić moved to Belgrade. Throughout the 1993 through 1996 period, he played with different musicians under the name Zabranjeno pušenje. Their album Ja nisam odavle was released through Komuna in 1997. In 1998 the band composed the music for Emir Kusturica's film Black Cat, White Cat, which won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival the same year. Since June 1999, the band has been regularly touring worldwide. They developed quite a following internationally in the process. Their popularity is particularly notable in Southern Europe (Italy, Portugal, Spain, and France) where most of their initial touring took place in late 1990s and early 2000s and in Latin America where the band first played in 2001, gradually developing a spirited fan base throughout the continent, especially in Argentina. Lately, the band has also fond much success deep into Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Armenia). In 2005, a DVD live album Live is a Miracle of the band's performance in Buenos Aires' Luna Park was released. In 2007, the band was involved in Time of the Gypsies punk opera that was staged in Bastille in Paris. Since the Ušće fiasco, the band played only a few more concerts on home soil such as 2008 large open-air gigs in Kruševac and Novi Sad that went well, serving as lead ins for the concert at Belgrade Arena in late November 2008 where more than 10,000 gathered. Though the band played Montreal twice before, summer 2010 marked their first foray into North America with concerts in Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, Chicago, and New York City. The highlight of the mini-tour was the outdoor concert in the streets of Montreal in front of some 60,000 spectators as part of the city's jazz festival (Le Festival International de Jazz de Montréal).    Controversy  The Belgrade-based band's live repertoire includes a homage to convicted war criminal Radovan Karadžić (a.k.a.

Internationally, she was best known for her roles as the Minbari Ambassador Delenn in the science fiction television series Babylon 5 (1993–1998), and as Danielle Rousseau in Lost (2004–2010), and also appeared in multiple award-winning films such as When Father Was Away on Business (1985) and The Abandoned (2010).    Early life  Furlan was born on 7 September 1955 to an intellectual and academic family that included a large number of university professors in Zagreb, PR Croatia, which at the time was one of the six constituent republics of the former Yugoslavia. She was born to Branka Weil, a mother who was of Croatian-Jewish descent, and Ivan Furlan, a father of mixed Slovene-Croat descent. As a child, Furlan was obsessed with American rock and roll music. She became interested in acting as a teenager. Furlan graduated from the Academy for Dramatic Arts in Zagreb with Bachelor of Fine Arts in theatre. Simultaneously, she took language classes at the university's Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, becoming fluent in English, German, and French.    Career     Acting  Furlan was a member of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb and frequently appeared in Yugoslav television and films. She played Ankica Vidmar in the film When Father Was Away on Business, which won the Palme d'Or at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In the late 1980s, she performed in theater productions in both Zagreb and Belgrade. Furlan became a member of the Actors Studio in 1992 after moving to New York City to flee turmoil in Yugoslavia. Later that year, her theater contacts in the U.S. helped her get the necessary work permits to perform with the Indiana Repertory Theatre as the lead role in Yerma. She appeared on the stage in New York City and Los Angeles. She played the central ensemble role of Minbari Ambassador Delenn for all five seasons of Babylon 5, and some of the associated TV movies. Between 2004 and 2010 she played the recurring role of Danielle Rousseau on Lost. In 2009, she appeared on an episode of NCIS, titled \"South By Southwest\". In 2002, she returned to Croatia after eleven years to take the lead role in Rade Šerbedžija's Ulysses Theatre Company's production of Euripides' Medea.    Singing  In the 1980s, Furlan briefly appeared as singer for Le Cinema, a spin-off from the rock band, Film. She was also featured as a vocalist on two tracks on the 1983 album, \"Nevino srce\" (\"Innocent Heart\") by Slovenian rock band, Buldožer. In 1998, she released an album, Songs From Movies That Have Never Been Made. Furlan also sang in the band, The Be Five, which produced a single album in 1998, Trying to Forget.    Writing  Furlan wrote the play Until Death Do Us Part (Croatian: Dok nas smrt ne razdvoji), which is set in 1970s Zagreb. A collection of her columns in the now-defunct Croatian magazine Feral Tribune was published as the book Totalna rasprodaja in 2010. Furlan chose to write her autobiography in English: Love me more than anything in the world: stories about belonging. The book is not only a self-portrait of the actress, but also a picture of the disintegration of the Yugoslavian country and its moral values.    Personal life  Furlan's husband was director Goran Gajić, who is an ethnic Serb. He directed her in an episode of Babylon 5 and in several plays, including a production of Sophocles' Antigone. Furlan was active in the Yugoslav feminist movement in the 1980s. Twice a month during the late 1980s, Furlan made the three-hour commute between Zagreb and Belgrade, where her husband was based, to act in theater productions in both cities. After the Croatian War of Independence began in 1991, she was fired by the Croatian National Theater for refusing to quit acting in a Belgrade theater production. An ensuing public smear campaign turned her colleagues and friends against her as she received threatening messages on her answering machine. Furlan wrote a public letter expressing her deep disappointment over the behaviour of her fellow citizens and colleagues and the threats of the nationalists against her.

As a young girl, she was a self-described tomboy, very athletic and played street hockey with the boys. Although the family was Sikh, her parents enrolled her in Catholic school as it was felt to be unsafe for her to go to public school. When she was 13, her family moved to Fort Gratiot, Michigan, then to Lake Forest, California, a year later, fulfilling her grandparents' dream that the family be together in one place. She had her first kiss at 11, lost her virginity at 16 with a basketball player, and discovered her bisexuality at 18.    Pornographic career  Before working in the porn industry, Leone worked at a German bakery, a Jiffy Lube store, and later a tax and retirement firm. She was also studying to become a nurse.  When picking a name for her adult career, Leone has stated that Sunny is her real name and that Leone was picked by Bob Guccione, former owner of Penthouse magazine. After posing for that magazine, she was named Penthouse Pet of the Month for the March 2001 issue, followed by a feature in the Holiday 2001 edition of Hustler magazine as a Hustler Honey. She has also appeared in other magazines including Cheri, Mystique Magazine, High Society, Swank, AVN Online, Leg World, Club International and Lowrider, while her online credits include ModFX Models, Suze Randall, Ken Marcus and Mac & Bumble. In 2003, she was named \"Penthouse Pet of the Year\" and starred in the video Penthouse Pets in Paradise alongside Tera Patrick and Kyla Cole. In 2005 Adam & Eve appointed her as their West Coast Internet Sales Representative.  That same year, Leone signed a three-year contract with Vivid Entertainment with which she transitioned into hardcore pornography, stating that she would only do lesbian scenes. Her first movie released was titled Sunny, and was released in December 2005. Her next movie, Virtual Vivid Girl Sunny Leone, was the first interactive title for Leone, who was the first Vivid Girl to make such a movie. Taking only four days to film, the movie won her first AVN Award (Best Interactive DVD). She followed this with Sunny Loves Cher, which featured her first on-screen squirting, and The Female Gardner co-starring Mikayla Mendez and Daisy Marie. Leone's last two movies under her contract with Vivid were It's Sunny in Brazil, which was filmed in Brazil, and The Sunny Experiment. The movies were released in October and December 2007, respectively. In May 2007, upon re-signing her contract with Vivid for another six films, Leone agreed to do her first boy/girl scenes, though only with her fiancé, Matt Erikson. That year she underwent breast augmentation, and shot her first movie under the new contract titled Sunny Loves Matt. For that film she was nominated for three (out of six) AVN awards in 2009, in addition to being a choice for Female Performer of the Year. When Father Was Away on Business( Отац на службеном путу) is a 1985 Yugoslav film by director Emir Kusturica. The screenplay was written by the Bosnian dramatist Abdulah Sidran. Its subtitle is\" A Historical Love Film\" and it was produced by Centar Film and Forum, production companies based in Sarajevo. Set in post- World War II Yugoslavia during the Informbiro period, the film tells the story from the perspective of a boy, Malik, whose father Meša( Miki Manojlović) was sent to a labour camp. \" When Father Was Away on Business\" won the Palme d' Or at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. == Plot ==\nIn June 1950, a local neighbourhood drunk, Čika Franjo, serenades field workers. He sings Mexican songs out of self-preservation, figuring it's safer for him to steer clear of songs originating from either of the two dominant global superpowers—the United States and the Soviet Union—in the current climate of the Cold War. Yugoslavia is experiencing a paranoid and repressive internal apparatus looking to identify and remove enemies of the state in the wake of the Tito–Stalin Split. The local children, including Malik, climb trees and play around. Malik's mother, Sena, tells him that his father is on a business trip, while Malik is a chronic sleepwalker. His father, communist functionary Meša, was, in fact, sent to a labour camp by his own brother-in-law, Sena's brother Zijo, who is an even higher-positioned Communist functionary. Meša had made a remark about a political cartoon regarding the Tito–Stalin Split in the Politika newspaper.\nAfter a while, Meša's wife and children rejoin him in Zvornik. Malik meets Maša, the daughter of a Russian doctor.

A computer screen film that takes place entirely on a Zoom video call, it follows a group of friends who attempt to escape a demon they inadvertently summoned during an online séance. After a short prank video by Savage which featured a handful of the film's cast went viral, he developed the concept into a feature-length film, which was shot over 12 weeks directly on the Zoom software during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cast members were in charge of their own cameras, sound, makeup, lighting, and stunts, with Savage directing them remotely from his own home. The film was released via the American streaming platform Shudder on 30 July 2020, with a British release date of 4 December 2020 being arranged by Vertigo Releasing. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its themes of social anxiety, its use of jump scares, and the cast's chemistry.    Plot  During a July 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in London, friends Haley, Jemma, Radina, Emma, Caroline, and Teddy join the weekly Zoom call they have been using to stay in touch. Haley has arranged for them to partake in a virtual séance led by the medium Seylan, who emphasises that they should not disrespect the spirits, though only Haley takes it seriously. Teddy is forced to leave the call when his girlfriend Jinny disconnects him. Jemma claims to feel intense tension around her neck and begins to cry, explaining that she feels the presence of a school friend who killed himself by hanging. Seylan's internet cuts out and disconnects her from the call, prompting a laughing Jemma to admit to the group that she made her deceased friend up because she was getting bored, which angers Haley. The remaining members begin to experience terrifying phenomena: Haley's chair is violently pulled backwards by an unseen force, the legs of a hanging corpse briefly appear in Caroline's attic when she goes to investigate a noise, and Emma's wine glass shatters even though nobody is holding it. Haley points her instant camera down the hallway to take a photo of her living room, which shows a ghostly figure hanging from the ceiling. As the girls panic, Haley manages to get back in touch with Seylan and tell her what happened, prompting Seylan to ask the spirit a series of yes or no questions; using this method, she quickly confirms that the spirit is not a friendly one. Seylan explains that Jemma's prank, which involved fabricating a deceased person, may have led a tulpa to take on the guise of the deceased person and wear his identity like a mask that allows the demon to pass into the world of the living. She gives them instructions on how to close the séance, but the demon interrupts her and she is disconnected again before the girls attempt to close the circle using her advice. Relieved that the ordeal seems to be over, the members of the group begin to leave the call. Radina leaves the room, unaware of her boyfriend Alan's body hanging behind her. Caroline's Zoom background, which shows a looping video of her doing chores, continues playing as the real Caroline suddenly has her face smashed into the camera. Forgetting to switch off a filter that superimposes masks and face paint onto her, Emma turns her camera towards her living room, where the filter places a kabuki mask on an invisible figure which then turns to look at her. She runs away and scatters flour on the floor, showing the footprints of the demon approaching her. Her kitchen cupboards burst open before the demon attacks her, but she escapes into her bedroom. Radina attempts to flee after Alan's body drops down behind her, but the demon kills her by throwing her into the wall. Noticing that Caroline is typing gibberish in the chat, Haley and Jemma watch as her camera turns back on to show her being killed by the demon repeatedly smashing her head into her keyboard while she pleads for help. Haley and Jemma argue and blame each other before Haley is pulled out of the room. Jemma, who lives around the corner from Haley, immediately leaves her home to help. Teddy returns to the call to see that only Emma remains, and a warning pops up to remind the group that the call will end in 10 minutes unless they upgrade to the premium version of Zoom. Unaware of everything that has occurred, Teddy believes Emma is pranking him, but he is attacked by the demon after it takes the form of a horrifying humanoid figure. He is chased into his garden, where he sees Jinny being lifted into the air before her neck is snapped and her body falls into the swimming pool. He runs away and hides, using a lighter to see where he is going, but the demon distracts him with an eerie music box his brother used to prank him with as a child. Olav Aaraas( born 10 July 1950) is a Norwegian historian and museum director. He was born in Fredrikstad. From 1982 to 1993 he was the director of Sogn Folk Museum, from 1993 to 2010 he was the director of Maihaugen and from 2001 he has been the director of the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History. In 2010 he was decorated with the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. John Francis Dillon (July 13, 1884 – April 4, 1934) was an American film director and actor of the silent era. He directed 130 films between 1914 and 1934. He also appeared in 74 films between 1914 and 1931. He was born in New York, New York, was a brother of Robert A. Dillon, and died in Los Angeles, California from a heart attack. He was married to the actress Edith Hallor.\n\n\n== Partial filmography == Richard Timothy Jones( born January 16, 1972) is an American actor. Jones is best known for his portrayals of Laveinio in the dramatic film\" The Wood\"( 1999) and Mike of the dramatic films\" Why Did I Get Married?\"( 2007) and\" Why Did I Get Married Too?\"( 2010). He is also well known for his role as Bruce Van Exel, court services officer on the CBS television series\" Judging Amy\" that aired from 1999 to 2005. Pioneer American film director D. W. Griffith (1875–1948) enjoyed a wide sphere of influence among his colleagues, including several who worked well past the end of the silent era, which proved the demarcation point for the end of Griffith's own career as director. This influence extended from directors that Griffith collaborated with and trained, such as Mack Sennett and Frank Powell, through those who only had glancing contact with him—such as Erich von Stroheim—and yet others in foreign lands who never worked with Griffith directly, for example, Jean Renoir and Sergei Eisenstein. The primary purpose of this list is to document the director names in the first two classes, while a more selective view is to be taken in the last class.\nGriffith himself principally learned his craft with cinematographer/director Billy Bitzer, who worked alongside Griffith, with a few interruptions, practically his whole career. Many of the technical developments once credited to Griffith were actually developed by Bitzer before they met. So Bitzer is the true father of film syntax.\n\n\n== A ==\nJohn G.

Shéyaa Bin Abraham-Joseph (born October 22, 1992), known professionally as 21 Savage, is a British-American rapper permanently based in the United States. Born in London and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, he began his recording career in 2013 and released three independent mixtapes to regional acclaim. His breakout project—the collaborative extended play (EP) with record producer Metro Boomin titled Savage Mode (2016)—peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200. Its lead singles, \"X\" (featuring Future) and \"No Heart\" both peaked within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. Later that year, he saw further recognition for his guest appearance on Drake's single \"Sneakin'\". He then signed a recording contract with Epic Records in January 2017. 21 Savage's debut studio album, Issa Album (2017), peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, while its lead single, \"Bank Account\" reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. That same year, he released the collaborative album Without Warning (2017) with Metro Boomin and fellow Georgia rapper Offset and guest appeared on Post Malone's 2017 single \"Rockstar\", which peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 and received two nominations—Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Performance—at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. His second album, I Am > I Was (2018), became his first to debut atop the Billboard 200. It spawned the single \"A Lot\" (featuring J. Cole), which won the Best Rap Song at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. The following year, he and Metro Boomin released a sequel to their breakout EP with Savage Mode II (2020), which also debuted atop the Billboard 200 and spawned the top ten-singles \"Runnin\" and \"Mr. Right Now\" (featuring Drake). He guest featured on Drake's 2022 single \"Jimmy Cooks,\" which marked his first song to debut atop the Hot 100 and second to do so overall. Later that year, he and Drake released the collaborative album Her Loss (2022), which saw continued success as his third project to peak the Billboard 200. His third album, American Dream (2024), became his fourth consecutive chart-topping project and did so for multiple weeks. 21 Savage was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on February 3, 2019. Officials revealed his status as a British citizen who entered the U.S. in July 2005 and unlawfully overstayed an H-4 visa that expired in 2006. He was granted bond on February 12 and released the next day, pending the outcome of an expedited deportation hearing, which was initially scheduled for April 9, but was later postponed indefinitely, with 21 Savage's lawyers stating he was legally residing in the U.S. for several years prior to the 2005 H-4 visa. In 2023, 21 Savage became a lawful permanent resident of the United States and received his green card; he is eligible for citizenship in 2028.    Early life  Shéyaa Bin Abraham-Joseph was born on October 22, 1992, at Newham University Hospital in the Plaistow area of London. He is the son of Heather Carmillia Joseph and Kevin Cornelius Emmons. His parents are both British nationals with Caribbean origins; his mother's family is from Dominica, and his father's is from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, while his paternal grandfather was Haitian. His father and twin sisters, dance choreographers Kyra and Jayda Davis, continue to live in London, where his father works for Westminster City Council. Abraham-Joseph's parents separated early in his life, and he moved at age seven with his mother to Atlanta, Georgia. In June 2005, at the age of 12, he returned to the United Kingdom for his uncle's funeral, stayed for a month, and then went back to Atlanta on an H-4 visa on July 22, 2005, which allegedly expired a year later. Abraham-Joseph's mother then began a relationship with Dr. Amsu Anpu, an endocrinologist and British expatriate, with whom she had more children. He had a brother, Quantivayus (\"Tay-Man\"), who died in a shooting after an attempted drug deal. In seventh grade, Abraham-Joseph was placed on probation for gun possession. Following a probation violation in the eighth grade, he was banned permanently from every school in the DeKalb County School District. This led him to begin attending schools around the Atlanta metropolitan area before being sent to a juvenile detention center. John Francis Dillon may refer to:\n\nJohn Francis Dillon (commissioner) (1866–1927), one of the first members of the Federal Radio Commission in the United States\nJohn Francis Dillon (director) (1884–1934), American film director and actor Clara Gordon Bow (; July 29, 1905 – September 27, 1965) was an American actress who rose to stardom during the silent film era of the 1920s and successfully made the transition to \"talkies\" in 1929. Her appearance as a plucky shopgirl in the film It brought her global fame and the nickname \"The It Girl\". Bow came to personify the Roaring Twenties and is described as its leading sex symbol. Bow appeared in 46 silent films and 11 talkies, including hits such as Mantrap (1926), It (1927), and Wings (1927). She was named first box-office draw in 1928 and 1929 and second box-office draw in 1927 and 1930. Her presence in a motion picture was said to have ensured investors, by odds of almost two-to-one, a \"safe return\". At the apex of her stardom, she received more than 45,000 fan letters in a single month, in January 1929. Two years after marrying actor Rex Bell in 1931, Bow retired from acting and became a rancher in Nevada. Her final film, Hoop-La, was released in 1933. In September 1965, Bow died of a heart attack at the age of 60.    Early life  Bow was born in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, at 697 Bergen Street, in a \"bleak, sparsely furnished room above [a] dilapidated Baptist Church\". Her birth year, according to the US Censuses of 1910 and 1920, was 1905. In US census records, enumerated April 15, 1910, and January 7, 1920, Bow's age is stated 4 and 14 years, respectively. The 1930 census stated an age of 23, and on her gravestone of 1965, the inscription says 1907, but 1905 is the year accepted by a majority of sources. Bow was her parents' third child. Her two older sisters, born in 1903 and 1904, had died in infancy. Her mother, Sarah Frances Bow (née Gordon, 1880–1923), was told by a doctor not to become pregnant again, for fear the next baby might die as well. Despite the warning, Sarah became pregnant with Clara in late 1904. In addition to the risky pregnancy, a heat wave besieged New York in July 1905, and temperatures peaked around 100 °F (38 °C). Years later, Clara wrote: \"I don't suppose two people ever looked death in the face more clearly than my mother and I the morning I was born. We were both given up, but somehow we struggled back to life.\" Bow's parents were descended from English and Scots-Irish immigrants who had come to America the generation before. Bow said that her father, Robert Walter Bow (1874–1959), \"had a quick, keen mind... all the natural qualifications to make something of himself, but didn't... everything seemed to go wrong for him, poor darling\". By the time Clara was four and a half, her father was out of work. Between 1905 and 1923, the family lived at 14 different addresses, but seldom outside Prospect Heights, with Clara's father often absent. \"I do not think my mother ever loved my father\", she said. \"He knew it. And it made him very unhappy, for he worshipped her always.\" When Bow's mother was 16, she fell from a second-story window and suffered a severe head injury. She was later diagnosed with \"psychosis due to epilepsy\". From her earliest years, Bow had learned how to care for her mother during the seizures, as well as how to deal with her psychotic and hostile episodes. She said her mother could be \"mean to me—and she often was\", but \"she didn't mean to be and that it was because she couldn't help it\". Still, Bow felt deprived of her childhood; \"As a kid I took care of my mother, she didn't take care of me\".  Sarah worsened gradually, and when she realized her daughter was set for a movie career, Bow's mother told her she \"would be much better off dead\". One night in February 1922, Bow awoke to a butcher knife held against her throat by her mother. Clara was able to fend off the attack, and locked her mother in her room. In the morning, Bow's mother had no recollection of the episode. Later, she was committed to a \"sanatarium\" by Robert Bow. Clara spoke about the incident later:  It was snowing. My mother and I were cold and hungry. We had been cold and hungry for days. We lay in each other's arms and cried and tried to keep warm. It grew worse and worse.

He was twice nominated for the Golden Globe Award in 1952 and 1964 and inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.    Early years   Roland was born in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, and originally intended to become a bullfighter like his father and his paternal grandfather. When Pancho Villa took control of their town, Roland and his family fled to the United States. He lived in Texas until at age 14 he hopped on a freight train and went to Hollywood. After arriving there, he found menial jobs and slept in a Catholic church. He often lost those jobs because he spent time working as an extra in films. He chose his screen name by combining the names of his favorite actors, John Gilbert and Ruth Roland. He was often cast in the stereotypical Latin lover role.    Career  Roland's first film contract was with Paramount. His first major role was in the collegiate comedy The Plastic Age (1925) together with Clara Bow, to whom he became engaged. In 1926, he played Armand in Camille opposite Norma Talmadge, with whom he was romantically involved, and they starred together in several productions. With the advent of sound films, Roland frequently appeared in Spanish language adaptations of American films in romantic lead roles. In 1933, Roland played a large supporting role in She Done Him Wrong as one of Mae West's character's lovers, along with rivals Cary Grant, Noah Beery Sr. and Owen Moore. Roland served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. Beginning in the 1940s, critics began to take notice of his acting, and he was praised for his supporting roles in John Huston's We Were Strangers (1949), The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), Thunder Bay (1953), and Cheyenne Autumn (1964). He also appeared in a series of films in the mid-1940s as the popular character \"The Cisco Kid\". He played Hugo, the agnostic (and fictional) friend of the three shepherd children in The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima, based on the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima in 1917. In 1953, Roland played Greek-American sponge diver Mike Petrakis in the epic Beneath the 12-Mile Reef. He also portrayed Howard McMahon on Bewitched, acted on December Bride and Playhouse 90, and both wrote the script for and acted in an episode of Wagon Train. He played Don Domingo Montoya, who inherits Rancho Montoya near the end of the series The High Chaparral. His last film appearance was in the 1982 western Barbarosa.    Personal life   Roland married actress Constance Bennett on April 20, 1941, in Yuma, Arizona. They were married until 1946 and had two daughters, Lorinda \"Lynda\" (b. 1938) and Christina \"Gyl\" (b. 1941). Bennett won custody of their daughters. He had appeared with Bennett in 1933 as Pepe in George Cukor's Our Betters, and in the same year, as the romantic lead in After Tonight, a World War I drama. His second marriage to Guillermina Cantú in 1954 lasted until his death 40 years later.    Death  Gilbert Roland died of cancer in Beverly Hills, California, in 1994, aged 88. His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.    Accolades  Roland was nominated twice for a Golden Globe Award, for his roles in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and Cheyenne Autumn (1964). For his contributions to the motion picture industry, Gilbert Roland has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6730 Hollywood Boulevard.    Archives  The moving-image collection of Gilbert Roland is held at the Academy Film Archive. Home movies make up the bulk of the collection. The film material at the Academy Film Archive is complemented by material in the Gilbert Roland papers at the academy's Margaret Herrick Library. In 1975, El Paso, Texas, held Gilbert Roland Days.

Matthew Raymond Dillon (born February 18, 1964) is an American actor. He has received various accolades, including an Academy Award nomination and Grammy nomination. Dillon made his feature film debut in Over the Edge (1979) and established himself as a teen idol by starring in the films My Bodyguard (1980), Little Darlings (1980), Liar's Moon (1982), The Flamingo Kid (1984) and three of five S. E. Hinton book adaptations: Tex (1982), Rumble Fish (1983) and The Outsiders (1983). From the late 1980s onward, Dillon achieved further success, starring in Drugstore Cowboy (1989), Singles (1992), The Saint of Fort Washington (1993), To Die For (1995), Beautiful Girls (1996), In & Out (1997), There's Something About Mary (1998), and Wild Things (1998). In a 1991 article, movie critic Roger Ebert referred to him as the best actor within his age group, along with Sean Penn. In 2002, he made his directing debut with City of Ghosts and has since continued to act  in films such as Factotum (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), The House That Jack Built (2018), and Asteroid City (2023). For Crash (2004), he won an Independent Spirit Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He had earlier been nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for narrating Jack Kerouac's On the Road. On television, he starred in the first season of the FOX television series Wayward Pines (2015), for which he was nominated for a Saturn Award.    Early life  Dillon was raised in Mamaroneck, New York by homemaker Mary Ellen and Paul Dillon, a portrait painter and sales manager for toy bear manufacturer Union Camp. Paul Dillon also was the long-time golf coach at Fordham University, having been enshrined in the school's Hall of Fame in 2019. His paternal grandmother was the sister of comic strip artist Alex Raymond, the creator of Flash Gordon. Dillon is the second of six children with one sister and four brothers, one of whom is actor Kevin Dillon. Dillon was raised in a close-knit Roman Catholic family of Irish descent. He grew up in Mamaroneck, New York.    Career   In 1978, Jane Bernstein and a friend were helping director Jonathan Kaplan cast the teen drama Over the Edge when they found Dillon cutting class at Hommocks Middle School in Larchmont. Dillon auditioned for a role and made his debut in the film. The film received a regional, limited theatrical release in May 1979, and grossed only slightly over $200,000. Dillon's performance was well-received, which led to his casting in two films released the following year: the teenage sex comedy Little Darlings, in which Kristy McNichol's character loses her virginity to a boy from the camp across the lake, played by Dillon, and the more serious teen dramedy My Bodyguard, where he played a high-school bully opposite Chris Makepeace. The films, released in March and July 1980, respectively, were box office successes and raised Dillon's profile among teen audiences. Another of Dillon's early roles was in the Jean Shepherd PBS special The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters. The only available copies of this film are stored at UCLA, where a legal dispute makes it unavailable to the public. One of his next roles was in Liar's Moon, where he played Jack Duncan, a poor Texas boy madly in love with a rich banker's daughter. In the early 1980s, Dillon also had prominent roles in three adaptations of S. E. Hinton novels: Tex (1982), The Outsiders (1983) and Rumble Fish (1983). All three films were shot in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Hinton's hometown. The Outsiders and Rumble Fish had Dillon working with Francis Ford Coppola and Diane Lane.

Though estimations vary widely, it is believed by scholars to have been spoken as a single language around 12,000 to 18,000 years ago (12 to 18 kya), that is, between 16,000 and 10,000 BC. Although no consensus exists as to the location of the Afroasiatic homeland, the putative homeland of Proto-Afroasiatic speakers, the majority of scholars agree that it was located within a region of Northeast Africa. The reconstruction of Proto-Afroasiatic is problematic and has not progressed to the degree found in Indo-European linguistics. The immense amount of time over which the branches have been separated, coupled with the wide gap between the attestations of the original branches (3rd millennium BC for Egyptian and Semitic, 19th and 20th centuries for many Chadic, Cushitic, and Omotic languages) mean that determining sound correspondences has not yet been possible. In addition to more traditional proposed consonant correspondences, there is also a divergent proposal that has become popular among Egyptologists; there is no agreement about PAA's vowels, the existence of tone, or its syllable structure. At the same time, scholars disagree to whether and to what extent the classical Semitic languages are a conservative, faithful representation of PAA morphology. This is particularly important for the question of whether the lexical roots in the language were originally mostly biradical or triradical, that is, whether they originally had two or three consonants. It also plays into the question of the degree to which Proto-Afroasiatic had root-and-pattern morphology, as most fully displayed in the Semitic, Egyptian, and Cushitic branches. There are nonetheless some items of agreement and reconstructed vocabulary. Most scholars agree that Proto-Afroasiatic nouns had grammatical gender, at least two and possibly three grammatical numbers (singular, plural, and possibly dual), as well as a case system with at least two cases. Proto-Afroasiatic may have had marked nominative or ergative-absolutive alignment. A deverbal derivational prefix *mV- is also widely reconstructed. While there is disagreement about the forms of the PAA personal pronouns, there is agreement that there were independent and \"bound\" (unstressed, clitic) forms. There is also agreement that a widespread demonstrative pattern of n  masculine and plural, t feminine goes back to PAA, as well as about the existence of an interrogative pronoun *mV, which may not have distinguished animacy. There is some agreement that the PAA verb had two or possibly three basic forms, though there is disagreement about what those forms were and what tenses, aspects, or moods they expressed. There is also widespread agreement that there were possibly two sets of conjugational affixes (prefixes and suffixes) used for different purposes. Additionally, the importance of verbal gemination and reduplication and the existence of three derivational affixes, especially of a causative -*s-, are commonly reconstructed. A numeral system cannot be reconstructed, although numerous PAA numerals and cognate sets from 1 to 9 have been proposed.    Dating  There is no consensus as to when Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken. The absolute latest date for when Proto-Afroasiatic could have been extant is c. 4000 BCE, after which Egyptian and the Semitic languages are firmly attested. However, in all likelihood these languages began to diverge well before this hard boundary. The estimations offered by scholars as to when Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken vary widely, ranging from 18,000 BCE to 8,000 BCE. An estimate at the youngest end of this range still makes Afroasiatic the oldest proven language family. Contrasting proposals of an early emergence, Tom Güldemann has argued that less time may have been required for the divergence than is usually assumed, as it is possible for a language to rapidly restructure due to areal contact, with the evolution of Chadic (and likely also Omotic) serving as pertinent examples.    Problems of reconstruction  At present, there is no commonly accepted reconstruction of Afroasiatic morphology, grammar, syntax, or phonology. Because of the great amount of time since Afroasiatic split into branches, there are limits to what scholars can reconstruct. Cognates tend to disappear from related languages over time. There are currently not many widely accepted Afroasiatic cognates, and it is difficult to derive sound correspondence rules from a small number of examples. David Longfen Ji is an American businessman who co-founded Apex Digital, an electronics manufacturer. In 2004, he was arrested in China following a dispute with Sichuan Changhong Electric, a supplier owned by the city of Mianyang and the province of Sichuan. Changhong accused him of defrauding them through bad checks. Ji was taken, according to an account by his lawyer, to the senior management and told, \"I decide whether you live or die.\" He has been held in China without charges. Ji's case highlighted an \"implicit racism\" in dealings with American businessmen. As a U.S. citizen he was not granted the same treatment by authorities as non-ethnically Chinese businessmen sharing the same nationality. Richard J.

Additionally Mulhouse commune is the principal commune of the 39 communes which make up the communauté d'agglomération of Mulhouse Alsace Agglomération (m2A, population 280,000 in 2020). Mulhouse commune is a subprefecture, the administrative centre of the Arrondissement of Mulhouse. It is one of the most populated sub-prefectures in France.    History   In 58 BC a battle took place west of Mulhouse and opposed the Roman army of Julius Caesar by a coalition of Germans led by Ariovistus. The first written records of the town date from the twelfth century. It was part of the southern Alsatian county of Sundgau in the Holy Roman Empire. From 1354 to 1515, Mulhouse was part of the Zehnstädtebund, an association of ten Free Imperial Cities in Alsace. The city joined the Swiss Confederation as an associate in 1515 and was therefore not annexed by France in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 like the rest of the Sundgau. An enclave in Alsace, it was a free and independent Calvinist republic, known as Stadtrepublik Mülhausen, associated with the Swiss Confederation until, after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798, it became a part of France in the Treaty of Mulhouse signed on 28 January 1798, during the Directory period of the French Revolution. Starting in the middle of the eighteenth century, the Koechlin family pioneered cotton cloth manufacturing; Mulhouse became one of France's leading textile centers in the nineteenth century. André Koechlin (1789–1875) built machinery and started making railroad equipment in 1842. The firm in 1839 already employed 1,800 people. It was one of the six large French locomotive constructors until the merger with Elsässische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden in 1872, when the company became Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques. After the Prussian victory in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Mulhouse was annexed to the German Empire as part of the territory of Alsace-Lorraine (1871–1918). The city was briefly occupied by French troops on 8 August 1914 at the start of World War I, but they were forced to withdraw two days later in the Battle of Mulhouse. French forces then reoccupied the city again on 19 August, before retreating again on 28 August having suffered heavy casualties. Alsatians who celebrated the appearance of the French army were left to face German reprisals, with several citizens sentenced to death. After World War I ended in 1918, French troops entered Alsace, and Germany ceded the region to France under the Treaty of Versailles. After the Battle of France in 1940, it was occupied by German forces until its return to French control at the end of World War II in May 1945. The town's development was stimulated first by the expansion of the textile industry and tanning, and subsequently by chemical and Engineering industries from the mid 18th century. Mulhouse was for a long time called the French Manchester. Consequently, the town has enduring links with Louisiana, from which it imported cotton, and also with the Levant. The town's history also explains why its centre is relatively small.    Geography  Two rivers run through Mulhouse, the Doller and the Ill, both tributaries of the Rhine.

George Duane Baker (April 22, 1868 – June 2, 1933) was an American motion picture director whose career began near the dawn of the silent film era. == Early life ==\nHe was born at Champaign, Illinois on April 22, 1868.\nHe was the second son and third child of Arminta  and Charles E. Baker. Three or four years later a baby girl would close the gender gap before Baker's father, an accountant and financial advisor, chose to relocate his family to the rural town of Beatrice, Nebraska sometime in the early 1880s. Upon his high school graduation, Charles Baker offered his son two options, a traditional college education or art classes in Paris. George Baker declined both offers and chose instead to attend the Dramatic Conservatory of Chicago, where he may have first met Walker Whiteside, another student of Prof. Kayzer's from around that time.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe debuted with the young Shakespearian actor Walker Whiteside in Hamlet as Laertes and would later tour with companies headed by Nance O'Neil, McKee Rankin, David Higgins, Russ Wytal Brady and others. Baker spent a number of seasons in vaudeville with Sadie Martinot, Marie Dupont and Eva Taylor. He later worked as a producer, actor and playwright in partnership with James W. Castle on theatrical productions of Graustark, based on the book by George Barr McCutcheon and The Brothers Grimm fairy tale, The Goose Girl. Baker would some years later adapt both stories for film. Baker also penned the plays His Brother’s Birthright and As the Sun Went Down.\nSometime around 1908 Baker joined Vitagraph Studios and began directing comedies starring John Bunny and Flora Finch and later went on direct such films as The Dust of Egypt, Tarantula, A Night Out and A Price for Folly. After three and a half years with Vitagraph, Baker joined Metro Studios where he soon rose to the position of Director General of Metro's West Coast productions.\nWhile vacation in New York, after four years with Metro, Baker received a number of tempting job offers from competing studios.  He chose instead to take advantage of his popularity by severing his ties with Metro to work as a freelance director on projects of his own choosing. George Baker wrote the scenarios for a number of the films and was responsible for almost all the continuity work on films he directed. He continued to work well into the 1920s before retiring in his late fifties.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBesides his stage and film work, Baker had also done illustrations for newspapers and magazines and was known as an accomplished still photographer. He was well read with a special interest in the arts. George Duane Baker died at the age of sixty-five on June 2, 1933, in Hollywood, California.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\n1914 Hearts and Diamonds (Director)\n1916 The Wager (Screenwriter)\n1916 The Tarantula (Director/Screenwriter)\n1916 The Two Edged Sword\n1917 Sowers and Reapers (Director/Screenwriter)\n1917 The Lifted Veil (Director)\n1917 The White Raven (Director)\n1917 His Father’s Son (Director)\n1917 Outwitted (Director)\n1917 The Duchess of Doubt (Director/scenario)\n1918 The Shell Game (Director)\n1918 Revelation (Director)\n1918 Toys of Fate (Director)\n1918 The Return of Mary (Producer, screenplay)\n1918 Her Inspiration (Producer, screenplay)\n1918 No Man's Land (Titles, editor)\n1918 The Demon (Director, writer)\n1918 In Judgement Of (Screenwriter)\n1918 Unexpected Places (Producer, scenario)\n1918 Hitting the High Spots (Producer, scenario)\n1919 The Spender (Producer, adaption)\n1919 As the Sun Went Down (Screenwriter)\n1919 The Lion’s Den (Director)\n1919 Peggy Does Her Darndest (Director)\n1919 Castles in the Air (Director, screenplay)\n1919 The Cinema Murder (Director)\n1919 In for Thirty Days (Producer, screenplay)\n1919 Faith\n1919 One-Thing-at-a-Time O'Day (Scenario)\n1919 The Uplifters (Scenario)\n1920 The Man Who Lost Himself (Director)\n1920 Heliotrope (Director)\n1921 Without Limit (Director)\n1921 Buried Treasure (Director)\n1921 Proxies (Director)\n1921 The Hunch (Director)\n1921 Garments of Truth (Director)\n1922 Don't Write Letters (Director)\n1922 I Can Explain (Director)\n1922 Little Eva Ascends (Director)\n1923 Slave of Desire (Director)\n1924 Revelation (Director)\n?

Baker also played an (uncredited) NASA engineer in You Only Live Twice. Ian Fleming considered Baker to be the ideal candidate to play James Bond in the films but the role went to Sean Connery because Baker had prior commitments.

He was the largest individual owner of U.S. Steel stock; in the early 1920s, his shares were worth some $5,965,000 (equivalent to around $83,245,000 in 2017 dollars), according to a May 4, 1924, article in Time.    Media depiction   The April 14, 1924, edition of Time said of Baker:  True, he is twice as rich as the original J.P. Morgan, having a fortune estimated at 200 millions. True, at the age of 84 when he has retired from many directorates, he dominates half a dozen railroads, several banks, scores of industrial concerns. Baker was \"closely associated with\" Morgan, the late 19th-century and early 20th-century U.S. robber-baron, monopolist, and Wall Street banker \"in his manifold enterprises\", according to Richard Boyer and Herbert Morais's 1955 book, Labor's Untold Story. The book notes that \"Morgan and associates organized super-trusts in steel (U.S. Steel), shipping (International Mercantile Marine), and agricultural machinery (International Harvester);\" and it also \"had its hands in other fields—the railroads (where...some 30,000 miles of railway were controlled), anthracite coal (where from two-thirds to three-quarters of the entire shipment was in Morgan hands).\" Other Morgan monopolies included electrical machinery (General Electric), communications (AT&T, Western Union), traction companies (IRT in New York, Hudson & Manhattan), and insurance (Equitable Life). In 1934, Time called him \"the richest, most powerful and most taciturn commercial banker in U. S. history\", while an article in Newsweek described him as one of the most imposing figures in banking history. In the November 1994 issue of Worth magazine, James Grant, editor of the financial newsletter Grant's Interest Rate Observer, calls Baker a hidebound turn-of-the-century banker who always got his loans repaid. Baker was famously silent in public, never commenting on events or giving interviews, until 1922, at age 82, when he gave his first newspaper interview. Thereafter, he spoke occasionally at luncheons and gatherings.    Businesses  The following is a list of businesses in which Baker held a controlling or otherwise significant interest during his lifetime.    Personal life  In 1869, Baker was married to Florence Tucker Baker, a daughter of Benjamin Franklin Baker and Sophronia J. (nee Whitney) Baker.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Where was the director of film The Sporting Duchess (1915 Film) born?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe Sporting Duchess is an 1895 play by Cecil Raleigh, Henry Hamilton and Augustus Thomas.   In England it was titled The Derby Winner and played at Drury Lane.\n\n\n== Production ==\nBecause Hammerstein's Harlem Opera House opened a play called The Derby Winner in February 1895, the name of the English play had to be changed, with the New York World approving it with \"apologies to Sir Gus, that seems to be a much more fascinating title.\"\nProduced by Charles Frohman, it ran for 212 performances in New York at the Academy of Music, debuting on August 29, 1895, and was the second longest Broadway production of the year, after The Heart of Maryland.  Twenty horses appeared in the race scene.  The show closed on February 29, 1896.  Then going on tour, the play's first stop was a successful run at the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAlan Dale of The New York World reviewed the play for the melodramatic spectacle it was, writing:  \" 'The Sporting Duchess' absolutely defies criticism, for its materials have been written about for decades. It doesn't contain one gleam of anything that is new, for it is composed principally of the best bits of other melodramas. Everything is there--mortgages, encumbered estates, the wronged lady who can no longer conceal her condition, the sorrowing popper, who clinches his fist and sets his lip as he talks of poor Mary; the devilish adventuress with the devilish cigarette; the impecunious earl, the trained race horses (oh! hang the cable and trolley that have let them loose; if we must have them let it be in sausages), and last, but not least, the villain who goes about ruining pretty ladies just\nbecause tradition says that he has got to do so.\"  Yet, he admitted the play was a \"handsome spectacle\" with a cast that was \"the very best that the market can supply in or out of season.\"\nAs the play's run stretched into 1896, the Sun noted it was \"now the senior play as to continuous use in town.  The reason for this long popularity lies about equally in the excellent acting and the realistic scenes, both being far better than the matter of the drama proper.\" \n\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe play was adapted into silent films of the same name in 1915, starring Rose Coghlan and Ethel Clayton, and in 1920, starring Alice Joyce.\n\n\n== Broadway cast ==\nE. J. Ratcliffe as Earl of Desborough\nRoy Richardson as Viscount Fernside\nAlfred Fisher as Colonel Donelly\nFrancis Carlyle as Major Mostyn\nW.D. Hanbury as Lord Chisholm\nWilliam Harcourt as Rubert Leigh\nR.A. Roberts as Cyprian Streatfield\nJ.H. Stoddart as Joe Aylmer\nH.D.

It was produced by the Lubin Manufacturing Company.\nRemade in 1920 at Vitagraph with Alice Joyce. == Cast ==\n\n\n== Preservation ==\nWith no prints of The Sporting Duchess located in any film archives, it is a lost film. Rosamond Marie Coghlan (March 18, 1851 – April 2, 1932) was an English actress.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRosamond Marie Coghlan was born in Peterborough, England, to author Francis Coghlan, and Anna Marie, née Kirby. Her elder brother (or half-brother) was the actor Charles Francis Coghlan. Her niece was Gertrude Coghlan. Rose went to America in 1871 as part of Lydia Thompson's troupe touring the U.S.. She made her Broadway debut in 1872 in a musical. Coghlan was again in England from 1873 to 1877, playing with Barry Sullivan, and then returned to America. She became prominent as Countess Zicka in Diplomacy, and Stephanie in Forget-me-not. She was at Wallack's almost continuously until 1888, and subsequently appeared in melodrama in parts like the title-role of The Sporting Duchess.\n\nFollowing the 1899 death of her brother, Charles Coghlan, in 1901 Rose appeared at Denver, Colorado's, Elitch Theatre in the world premiere of her brother's play, Fortune's Bridge. Rose stated that \"my particular reason for coming to Denver was to produce my brother's play -- the one he finished just before his death. It's called Fortune's Bridge, but he didn't give it the name.\" Rose explained that the manuscript was sent to a typist and at the end her brother signed it and added his Canadian address: \"Charles Coghlan, Fortune Bridge.\" Apparently the typist moved it to the head of the first page and typed, \"Fortune's Bridge, by Charles Coghlan.\" Rose stated \"the name seemed to fit the play so well I allowed it to stand.\"\nCoghlan died in Harrison, New York two weeks past her 81st birthday. She had been married twice first to Clinton J. Edgerly from 1885 to 1890 and second to John T. Sullivan from 1890 to 1893. She had two children, an adopted daughter and a son.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nAs You Like It (1912)\nThe Eavesdropper (1912) (*short)\nThe Sporting Duchess (1915)\nThou Shalt Not Kill (1915)\nThe Faded Flower (1916)\nHer Surrender (1916)\nBeyond the Rainbow (1922)\nThe Secrets of Paris (1922)\nUnder the Red Robe (1923)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

Gary Paul O'Neil (born 18 May 1983) is an English football manager and former player who is currently head coach of Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers.  A midfielder, O'Neil made 214 Premier League appearances and scored 16 goals between 2003 and 2016, representing Portsmouth, Middlesbrough, West Ham United and Norwich City. He also played in the Football League First Division or EFL Championship for all four of those clubs plus Walsall, Cardiff City, Queens Park Rangers, Bristol City and Bolton Wanderers. In his first job as a manager, O'Neil led AFC Bournemouth to a 15th place finish in the 2022–23 Premier League, but was then dismissed ahead of the following season. He was appointed head coach by Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 2023.    Club career     Portsmouth  O'Neil was born in Beckenham, London and grew up in Downham. Tony Pulis gave O'Neil his Portsmouth debut as a 16-year-old on 29 January 2000 at home to Barnsley in the First Division, but kept him out of the spotlight for the rest of the season. The following year both Pulis and his successor Steve Claridge used O'Neil sparingly but Portsmouth's third manager of a disastrous season, Graham Rix, made O'Neil a starter for the final five matches of the season. Portsmouth went into the final game against Barnsley needing to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation to what was then the Second Division. They won the match 3–0 and survived, with O'Neil scoring the second goal, his first in professional football. In the 2001–02 season, O'Neil scored a volley against his boyhood club Millwall. When Harry Redknapp took over as manager at the end of the season, O'Neil was one of the few players not to be moved on in the rebuilding of the squad. In Redknapp's first full season O'Neil only started 11 league matches, scoring three goals, as Portsmouth won the First Division title and  promotion to the Premier League.  O'Neil was loaned to Walsall at the beginning of the 2003–04 season in order to gain first team experience. His performances for the Midlands side and Portsmouth's increasing injury problems led to a recall in November 2003. He went straight into the starting eleven for his Premier League debut against bottom of the table Leeds United at Fratton Park and scored two goals in a 6–1 win. This performance meant that he maintained his place for the next match, away at Fulham but then had to travel to Dubai to captain England Under 20s in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship. Upon his return, O'Neil found that Portsmouth's injury problems had cleared up and he could not break back into the team for the remainder of the season. At the beginning of the 2004–05 season he was loaned to Cardiff City to gain further first team experience, scoring once in the league against Millwall. He was recalled to Portsmouth in November who yet again were experiencing an injury crisis. He made his return to the side in one of the biggest matches of the season, a 2–1 defeat at Southampton. He was picked again for the next match, at home to Manchester City, and scored in a 3–1 loss. This was the last match of Redknapp's reign, and technical director Velimir Zajec took over a temporary manager and made O'Neil a regular in the Pompey midfield. During Zajec's five-month reign Portsmouth fell from midtable to relegation candidates and Alain Perrin was appointed to keep the club in the Premier League. O'Neil scored away at Manchester United and European champions Liverpool bid £5 million for him, which was rejected by Portsmouth. O'Neil went into the 2005–06 season as a regular for Perrin's new-look team and, like in the 2002–03 campaign, he was one of the few players to survive from the previous year. By November Portsmouth were at the bottom of the Premier League and Perrin was sacked only seven months after being appointed. In Redknapp's first match back in charge at Tottenham Hotspur, O'Neil retained his place in the team and was picked on the right of midfield. O'Neil's late handball conceded the penalty for Spurs' winner. O'Neil was moved into his preferred position of central midfield a few games later and Pompey went on their best run of the season with O'Neil scoring in successive home games. Peter Levin is an American director of film, television and theatre. Jesse Edward Hobson( May 2, 1911 – November 5, 1970) was the director of SRI International from 1947 to 1955. Prior to SRI, he was the director of the Armour Research Foundation. Barry O'Neil (September 24, 1865 - March 23, 1918) was a film director and writer. His real name was Thomas J. McCarthy. He directed several Thanhouser films including the production company's first two-reeler, \"Romeo and Juliet\". He went on to work for Lubin and then World Film Corporation. He was born in New York City. O'Neil married actress Nellie Walters. He died of apoplexy. In 1910 and 1911 he filmed adaptations of a couple William Shakespeare plays. In 1915 he filmed a version of \"McTeague\" in Death Valley released as \"Life's Whirlpool\". William E. Hamilton was an assistant director to O'Neil. == Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Director ===\n\n\n=== Writer === The Little Hero of Holland is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company. It is an adaptation of the short fictional story popularized in Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates, about a boy who plugs a leaking dike with his finger to prevent it from bursting. The role of the boy was played by Marie Eline, but little else is known about the production and cast of the film. The director may have been Barry O'Neil and the writer may have been Lloyd Lonergan. Parts of the film were shot on Glen Park Island in New Rochelle, New York. The film was released on June 17, 1910 and saw a wide release, including the United Kingdom. The film is presumed lost.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThough the film is presumed lost, a synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: \"Hans is a little Dutch boy, the son of a poor fisherman. He, like all children of Holland, is early impressed with the fact that the safety of the whole community depends on the strength of the dike. He is sent upon an errand to his aunt late one evening. Walking along the foot of the dike, he discovers a tiny hole, through which the water is pouring. Realizing that if left to flow through even this small aperture, the water would soon break down the dike and flood the village, he sticks his tiny finger in the hole, and waits for someone to come to his assistance. Night comes on. His family decided he has stayed with his aunt, and do not worry about him. In the morning he is found almost unconscious from fatigue and exposure, by his little sister who has been searching for him. She runs back and notifies the villagers, who come to his assistance, repair the dike, and carry the little hero back to the village in triumph. He is received by the burgomaster and praised by the minister. By his night's heroism he has made himself a place in history, and will always be known as 'the little hero of Holland.'\"\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. The film was an adaptation of the fictional story that was popularized in Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates. The name of the boy, Hans, may be a reference to the erroneous association to unnamed character in the book. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Many of the scenes for the film were shot at Glen Park in New Rochelle, New York.\nOnly Marie Eline's credit as Hans, the young boy, is credited. Eline had previously played an Italian boy in The Two Roses. The other members cast may have included the leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company. Crane was also involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe single reel drama, approximate 650 feet long, was released on June 17, 1910. Some trade publications list the length of the film as 1000 feet though. The United Kingdom release of the film may have had the name of the hero changed to Peter. A synopsis in The Bioscope on October 27, 1910 refers to the hero by the name Peter. This alternative name for the hero of the story can be found in the 1910 publication of Reader 1st-4th by D. Appleton and Company. A review in The Moving Picture World was neutral because it lacked specific praise or criticism of the production. The film had a wide release, advertisements for the showing in theaters include those in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Missouri. The film is presumed lost.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of American films of 1910\n\n\n== References == Ian Barry is an Australian director of film and TV.

John Jordan \"Buck\" O'Neil Jr. (November 13, 1911 – October 6, 2006)  was an American first baseman and manager in the Negro American League, mostly with the Kansas City Monarchs.  After his playing days, he worked as a scout and became the first African American coach in Major League Baseball. In his later years he became a popular and renowned speaker and interview subject, helping to renew widespread interest in the Negro leagues, and played a major role in establishing the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2022 as an executive. O'Neil was prominently featured in Ken Burns's 1994 documentary series Baseball.  His life was documented in Joe Posnanski's 2007 book The Soul of Baseball.    Growing up  O'Neil was born in Carrabelle, Florida, to John Jordan O'Neil (1873–1954) and Louella Campbell (maiden; 1884–1945). O'Neil was initially denied the opportunity to attend high school owing to racial segregation. Florida had only four high schools specifically for African Americans. He grew up in Sarasota, Florida in the Newtown community. O'Neil worked the celery fields in Sarasota while his father ran a pool hall in Newtown. He then later moved to Jacksonville with relatives and attended Edward Waters College, where he completed high school and two years of college courses.    Playing career  In 1934, O'Neil left Florida for several years to participate in of semi-professional barnstorming experiences (playing interracial exhibition games). O'Neil signed with the Memphis Red Sox for their first year of play in 1937 in the newly formed Negro American League. His contract was sold to the Monarchs the following year. O'Neil had a career batting average of .288 between 1937 and 1950, including four .300-plus seasons at the plate, as well as five seasons in which he did not top .260. In 1946, the first baseman led the NAL with a .353 batting average and followed that in 1947 with a .350 mark in 16 games. He also posted averages of .345 in 1940 and .330 in 1949. He played in three East-West All-Star Games in three different seasons and two Negro World Series. O'Neil's baseball career was interrupted for two years (1944 and 1945) during World War II when he joined the U.S. Navy after the close of the 1943 season.  He served his enlistment in a naval construction battalion in New Jersey.  He returned to the Monarchs at the start of the 1946 season. O'Neil was named manager of the Monarchs in 1948 after Frank Duncan's retirement, and continued to play first base as well as a regular through 1951, dropping to part-time status afterward.  He managed the Monarchs for eight seasons from 1948 through 1955 during the declining years of the Negro leagues, winning two league titles and a shared title in which no playoff was held during that period. His two undisputed pennants were won in 1953 and 1955, when the league had shrunk to fewer than six teams.    Negro leagues career statistics  O'Neil was known to have played full-time in 1951 and as a reserve and pinch-hitter as late as 1955, but Negro leagues statistics for the period 1951 and after are considered unreliable, and rapidly dropping below major league quality.    Off the field   When Tom Baird sold the Monarchs at the end of the 1955 season, O'Neil resigned as manager and became a scout for the Chicago Cubs, and is credited for signing Hall of Fame player Lou Brock to his first professional baseball contract. O'Neil is sometimes incorrectly credited with also having signed Hall of Famer Ernie Banks to his first contract; Banks was originally scouted and signed to the Monarchs by Cool Papa Bell, then manager of the Monarchs' barnstorming B team in 1949. He played briefly for the Monarchs in 1950 and 1953, his play interrupted by Army duty. O'Neil was Banks' manager during those stints, and Banks was signed to play for the Cubs more than two years before O'Neil joined them as a scout. He was named the first black coach in the major leagues by the Cubs in 1962, although he was not assigned in-game base coaching duties, nor was he included in the Cubs' \"College of Coaches\" system, and was never allowed to manage the team during that time.

She is a film director, and an Israeli culture entrepreneur. Maxwell \"Max\" Woosnam (6 September 1892 – 14 July 1965) was a British sportsman who is sometimes referred to as the 'Greatest British sportsman' in recognition of his achievements. Among his achievements were winning an Olympic gold and silver in tennis at the 1920 Summer Olympics, winning the doubles at Wimbledon, compiling a 147 break in snooker, making a century at Lord's Cricket Ground, captaining the British Davis Cup team, captaining Manchester City F.C. finishing ultimately runners-up for the Football League Championship in 1920–21, and captaining the England national football team. He also played football for Cambridge Town.    Background  Max Woosnam was born in Liverpool, the son of Maxwell Woosnam, a clergyman who served as canon of Chester and Archdeacon of Macclesfield, and his wife Mary Seeley, daughter of Hilton Philipson. The Woosnam family were landed gentry, of Cefnllysgwynne, Brecknockshire, Wales, originally of Montgomeryshire. Woosnam spent most of his childhood in Aberhafesp, Mid Wales.  He attended Winchester College, where he captained the golf and cricket teams, and also represented the school at football and squash. As a schoolboy, he made scores of 144 and 33 not out for a Public Schools XI while playing against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. In 1911, Woosnam went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, representing Cambridge University at football, cricket, lawn tennis, real tennis and golf (being a scratch golfer), becoming a quadruple Blue. In the First World War, he fought alongside Siegfried Sassoon on the western front and in the Gallipoli Campaign. Woosnam took part in a number of wartime sporting events, including football matches between a team of enlisted Corinthians players and Aldershot Command, and a Military vs Queen's Club tennis match.    Corinthian FC  Straight from his University years, Max was chosen to travel on the Corinthians tour of Brazil in the summer of 1913. Managing the tour's first goal, against Rio de Janeiro, he also scored against Paulistano and made quite a name for himself. In 1914, he again set sail with the Corinthians for Brazil...however this tour was cancelled when still at sea, the side discovered War had been declared at home. At once, the Corinthians decided, true to their ethos that there was more to life than just sport, to return and join the army. After a quick stop in Rio, allowing the players a brief walk around the town, they set sail for home. Dodging German U-boats and torpedo fire, they eventually made it back to England. For Max, it would be his last adventure abroad with Corinthian FC. He remained with Corinthian for five years, as well as making a handful of appearances for Chelsea.    Post-war  After the war, Woosnam continued his amateur sporting career, taking part in several sporting events. Woosnam was a finalist in the 1919 All England Plate tournament, a tennis competition held at the Wimbledon Championships, consisting of players who were defeated in the first or second rounds of the singles competition. Following a defeat of Woosnam while representing Cambridge University in a tennis match against Queen's Club in April 1919, the Times remarked that \"Woosnam is a player of many games, and he could excel at tennis if he could devote enough time to the game... ...tennis is a mistress who must be constantly wooed.\" However, Woosnam continued to divide his attention; he played football for Chelsea either side of the Queen's Club match, captaining the team. His performance for Chelsea led to selection for a North versus South international trial match. Once the football season finished, Woosnam took part in several tennis tournaments. He won both the singles and doubles titles in the Cambridge University tournament, and entered Wimbledon for the first time. His tennis form in 1919 led The Times correspondent to describe his partnership with Noel Turnbull as a \"doubles team of promise\". Woosnam declined the opportunity to become a professional sportsman, finding the idea 'vulgar'.    Manchester City  Upon moving to Manchester, he signed for Manchester City on amateur terms. He made his debut on 1 January 1920 against Bradford City, a match that also saw the debut of Sam Cookson. Initially he played only home matches due to other commitments. However, when Manchester City, without Woosnam, suffered a shock 3–0 FA Cup defeat to Leicester City at the end of the month, some supporters blamed Woosnam's employers, Crossley Brothers. As a result, the engineering firm ordered Woosnam not to miss another game. Playing at centre half, Woosnam eventually became Manchester City captain at the recommendation of his teammates.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Dors came to public notice as a blonde bombshell, much in the style of Americans Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, and Mamie Van Doren. Dors was promoted by her first husband, Dennis Hamilton, mostly in sex film-comedies and risqué modelling. After it was revealed that Hamilton had been defrauding her, she continued to play up to her established image, and she made tabloid headlines with the parties reportedly held at her house. Later, she showed talent as a performer on TV, in recordings, and in cabaret, and gained new public popularity as a regular chat-show guest. She also gave well-regarded film performances at different points in her career. According to film critic David Thomson, \"Dors represented that period between the end of the war and the coming of Lady Chatterley in paperback, a time when sexuality was naughty, repressed, and fit to burst.\"    Early life  Diana Mary Fluck was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, on 23 October 1931 at the Haven Nursing Home. Her mother, Winifred Maud Mary (Payne), was married to Albert Edward Sidney Fluck, a railway clerk. Mary had been having an affair with another man, and when she announced she was pregnant with Diana, she admitted she had no idea if the other man or her husband was the father. Diana was educated at a small private school, Selwood House, on Bath Road, Swindon, from which she was eventually expelled. During the war, Diana dated a boy named Desmond Morris from the Boys' High School, also on Bath Road, Swindon. Morris, who was from one of the town's wealthier, more prominent families, used to take her aboard his rowing boat on the lake in his family's garden. The garden and lake later comprised Queen's Park in Swindon. In the late 1960s, Morris (a zoologist) became famous as the author of The Naked Ape and presenter of the TV series adapted from the book.: 14  From the age of eight, Hollywood actresses Veronica Lake, Lana Turner, and Jean Harlow became her heroines, and she enjoyed going to the cinema to watch them. Towards the end of the war, Dors entered a beauty contest to find a pin-up girl for Soldier Magazine; she came in third place. This led her to work as a model in art classes, and she began to appear in such local theatre productions as A Weekend in Paris and Death Takes a Holiday.    Early career     LAMDA  Having excelled in her elocution studies, after lying about her age, at 14 she was offered a place to study at London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), becoming the college's youngest student, starting in January 1946. She lodged at the Earl's Court YWCA, and supplemented her £2-per-week allowance, most of which was spent on her lodgings, by posing for the London Camera Club for one guinea (£1, 1s in \"old money\", £1.05 in \"new\", equivalent to £48 in 2023) an hour. Signed to the Gordon Harbord Agency in her first term, she won a bronze medal, awarded by Peter Ustinov, and in her second won a silver with honours.    First films  Just prior to LAMDA, Dors had unsuccessfully auditioned for the part of Kanchi in Black Narcissus that was played by Jean Simmons. She acted in public theatre pieces for LAMDA productions, one of which was seen by casting director Eric L'Epine Smith. He suggested Dors for what became the actor's screen debut in the noir film The Shop at Sly Corner (1947). Dors was cast in a walk-on role that developed into a speaking part.  Her pay rate was £8 per day for three days. During the signing of contracts, in agreement with her father, she changed her contractual surname to Dors, the maiden name of her maternal grandmother; this was at the suggestion of her mother Mary. Dors later commented on her name:  They asked me to change my name. I suppose they were afraid that if my real name Diana Fluck was in lights and one of the lights blew ... Returning to LAMDA two weeks later, she was asked by her agent to audition for Holiday Camp (1947) by dancing a jitterbug with young actor John Blythe.

The marriage ended after Henson began an affair in 1974 with actress Susan Hampshire, his co-star in several stage productions. He then married ballerina Marguerite Porter, with whom he had a third son, Keaton, a musician and illustrator.    Health  Henson was diagnosed with cancer in 2003. Surgeons removed tumours from around his spleen, but a routine check-up in 2006 showed that other tumours had grown, and it would be dangerous to remove them.

His father was a master carpenter.  He was evacuated from London during the Blitz campaign of World War II.  He was awarded a scholarship to train at the Italia Conti Academy stage school when he was 12 years old.  There, he learned alongside Millicent Martin, Nanette Newman and Anthony Newley.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOne of Briggs' first acting roles was in Quartet (1948), alongside George Cole. Briggs also worked as a stagehand at the Windmill Theatre, before completing two years of national service with the Royal Tank Regiment in Germany.\nUpon his return to acting in 1955, Briggs worked in theatre and made his television debut in The Younger Generation with John Thaw. He featured in the police drama No Hiding Place, as well as a few Carry On films.  He also had roles in a number of other British shows, including Crossroads, The Saint, The Persuaders! and Thick as Thieves.\nIn 2005 Briggs announced his intention to leave the role of Mike Baldwin in Coronation Street, citing the hectic filming schedule as the main reason for his departure. After appearing in 2,348 episodes, he filmed his final scenes in the show on 13 March 2006 and they were broadcast on 7 April.

While there she is forced to share a bed with her aunt's lodger Harry, a reclusive and disillusioned bachelor, who initially disapproves of her lifestyle.

But nothing, on either count, ever really happens. The claustrophobia of the one-room set quickly suffocates any ambiguity about the characters while Rilla's static direction keeps the story's flirtation with deceptive appearance and sordid reality firmly anchored in the latter. Even though Harry turns out not to be the inexperienced fellow he claims to be, the script never really investigates the possible ethics of the circumstance (will and/or should Harry defend his \"virginity\" and principles), but instead emphasises the vulgar implications stemming from it. Outside of the amateur psychology that informs the dream sequences, the film is never funny, and for all of love's victories it is never touching. Blowback is a 2000 film directed by Mark L. Lester.

The film is constructed from four continuous 93- minute takes that were filmed simultaneously by four cameramen; the screen is divided into quarters, and the four shots are shown simultaneously. The film depicts several groups of people in Los Angeles as they interact and conflict while preparing for the shooting of a movie in a production office. The dialogue was largely improvised, and the sound mix of the film is designed so that the most significant of the four sequences on screen dominates the soundtrack at any given moment. == Plot ==\nThe film takes place in and around a film production company office, and involves several interweaving plot threads which include a young actress named Rose who tries to score a screen test from her secret boyfriend Alex Green, a noted but disillusioned director. Meanwhile, Rose's tryst with him is discovered by her girlfriend Lauren, an insanely jealous businesswoman who plants a microphone in Rose's purse and spends most of the time in the back of her limousine parked outside the office building listening in on Rose's conversations.

        "answer": "no",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Do both directors of films Blücher (film) and The Good Old Soak have the same nationality?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nUna Merkel (December 10, 1903 – January 2, 1986) was an American stage, film, radio, and television actress. Merkel was born in Kentucky and acted on stage in New York in the 1920s. She went to Hollywood in 1930 and became a popular film actress. Two of her best-known performances are in the films 42nd Street and Destry Rides Again. She won a Tony Award in 1956 and was nominated for an Oscar in 1961.    Life and career  Merkel was born in Covington, Kentucky, to Bessie (née Phares) and Arno Merkel. In her early childhood, she lived in many of the Southern United States due to her father's job as a traveling salesman. At the age of 15, she and her parents moved to Philadelphia. They stayed there a year or so before settling in New York City, where she began attending the Alviene School of Dramatic Art.  Because of her strong resemblance to actress Lillian Gish, Merkel was offered a part as Gish's youngest sister in a silent film called World Shadows. However, the funding for the film dried up and it was never completed. Merkel went on to appear in a few silent movies, several of them for the Lee Bradford Corporation. She also appeared in the two-reel Love's Old Sweet Song (1923), which was made by Lee de Forest in his Phonofilm sound-on-film process and starred Louis Wolheim and Helen Weir. Not making much of a mark in films, Merkel turned her attention to the theater and found work in several important plays on Broadway. Her biggest triumph was in Coquette (1927), which starred her idol, Helen Hayes.   Invited to Hollywood by famous director D. W. Griffith to play Ann Rutledge in his film Abraham Lincoln (1930), Merkel became a big success in sound films. During the 1930s, she became a popular second lead in a number of films, usually playing the wisecracking best friend of the heroine, supporting actresses such as Jean Harlow, Carole Lombard, Loretta Young, and Eleanor Powell. Merkel was known for her Kewpie-doll looks, strong Southern accent, and wry line delivery. She played Sam Spade's secretary in the original 1931 version of The Maltese Falcon. Merkel was a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract player from 1932 to 1938, appearing in as many as 12 films in a year, often on loan-out to other studios. She was also often cast as leading lady opposite Jack Benny, Harold Lloyd, Franchot Tone, and Charles Butterworth, among others. In 42nd Street (1933), Merkel played a streetwise show girl. In the famous \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\" number, Merkel and Ginger Rogers sang the verse: \"Matrimony is baloney. She'll be wanting alimony in a year or so./Still they go and shuffle, shuffle off to Buffalo.\" Merkel appeared in both the 1934 and the 1952 film versions of The Merry Widow, playing different roles. She received second billing in The Good Old Soak (1937) with Wallace Beery and Ted Healy in the same year that Healy died mysteriously. One of her most famous roles was in the Western comedy Destry Rides Again (1939), in which her character, Lily Belle, gets into a famous \"cat-fight\" with Frenchie (Marlene Dietrich) over the possession of her husband's trousers, won by Frenchie in a crooked card game. She played the elder daughter to the W. C. Fields character, Egbert Sousé, in the 1940 film The Bank Dick. Her film career went into decline during the 1940s, although she continued working in smaller productions and in radio as Adeline Fairchild on The Great Gildersleeve. In 1950, she starred with William Bendix in the baseball comedy Kill the Umpire, which was a surprise hit. She made a comeback as a middle-aged woman playing mothers and maiden aunts, and in 1956 won a Tony Award for her role on Broadway in The Ponder Heart, adapted from the novella of the same name. She had a major part in the MGM 1959 film The Mating Game as Paul Douglas's character's wife and Debbie Reynolds' character's mother, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in Summer and Smoke (1961). She was also featured as Brian Keith's character's housekeeper, Verbena, in the Walt Disney comedy The Parent Trap in 1961. Wallace Fitzgerald Beery (April 1, 1885 – April 15, 1949) was an American film and stage actor. He is best known for his portrayal of Bill in Min and Bill (1930) opposite Marie Dressler, as General Director Preysing in Grand Hotel (1932), as Long John Silver in Treasure Island (1934), as Pancho Villa in Viva Villa! (1934), and his title role in The Champ (1931), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Beery appeared in some 250 films during a 36-year career. His contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer stipulated in 1932 that he would be paid $1 more than any other contract player at the studio. This made Beery the highest-paid film actor in the world during the early 1930s. He was the brother of actor Noah Beery and uncle of actor Noah Beery Jr. For his contributions to the film industry, Beery was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.    Early life   Beery was born the youngest of three boys on April 1, 1885, in Clay County, Missouri, near Smithville. The Beery family left the farm in the 1890s and moved to nearby Kansas City, Missouri, where his father was a police officer. A fourth brother, Charles, was born in 1880 but survived only a day after his birth. There might have been an older sister but information is faint. Beery attended the Chase School in Kansas City and took piano lessons as well, but showed little love for academic matters. He ran away from home twice, the first time returning after a short time, quitting school and working in the Kansas City train yards as an engine wiper. Beery ran away from home a second time at age 16 and joined the Ringling Brothers Circus as an assistant elephant trainer. He left two years later after being clawed by a leopard.    Career     Early career  Wallace Beery joined his older brother Noah in New York City in 1904, finding work in comic opera as a baritone, and appeared on Broadway and in summer stock theatre. He was in The Belle of the West in 1905. His most notable early role came in 1907 when he starred in The Yankee Tourist to good reviews.    Comedy film star – Essanay Studios  In 1913, he moved to Chicago to work for Essanay Studios. His first movie was likely a comedy short, His Athletic Wife (1913). Beery was then cast as Sweedie, a Swedish maid character he played in drag in a series of short comedy films from 1914 to 1916. Sweedie Learns to Swim (1914) co-starred Ben Turpin. Sweedie Goes to College (1915) starred Gloria Swanson, whom Beery married the following year. Other Beery films (mostly shorts) from this period included In and Out (1914), The Ups and Downs (1914), Cheering a Husband (1914), Madame Double X (1914), Ain't It the Truth (1915), Two Hearts That Beat as Ten (1915), and The Fable of the Roistering Blades (1915). The Slim Princess (1915), with Francis X. Bushman, was one of his earliest feature-length films. Beery also did The Broken Pledge (1915) and A Dash of Courage (1916), both with Swanson. Beery played a German soldier in The Little American (1917) with Mary Pickford, directed by Cecil B. De Mille. He did some comedies for Mack Sennett, Maggie's First False Step (1917) and Teddy at the Throttle (1917), but he gradually left that genre and specialized in portrayals of villains prior to becoming a major leading man during the sound era.    Villainous roles  In 1917, Beery portrayed Pancho Villa in Patria at a time when Villa was still active in Mexico. (Beery reprised the role 17 years later in Viva Villa!.) Beery was a villainous German in The Unpardonable Sin (1919) with Blanche Sweet. The Good Old Soak is a 1937 drama film starring Wallace Beery and directed by J. Walter Ruben from a screenplay by A. E. Thomas based upon the stage play of the same name by Don Marquis. The picture's supporting cast features Una Merkel, Eric Linden, Betty Furness, and Ted Healy. Screenwriter Thomas was disturbed that MGM changed the title from the original\" The Old Soak,\" to the\" Good Old Soak.\" MGM did that because it felt Wallace Beery's fans considered the word\" good\" synonymous with Beery. Rollin Kirby, a distinguished political cartoonist on the\" New York World\" newspaper, and good friend of Don Marquis, got a laugh from Marquis when he suggested how appropriate it was that a man named Beery would portray the Old Soak himself. Previously made as a silent film by Universal in 1926 called\" The Old Soak\" starring Jean Hersholt. == Plot ==\n\n\n== Cast ==\nWallace Beery as Clem Hawley\nUna Merkel as Nellie\nEric Linden as Clemmie Hawley\nJudith Barrett as Ina Heath\nBetty Furness as Lucy Hawley\nTed Healy as Al Simmons\nJanet Beecher as Matilda Hawley\nGeorge Sidney as Kennedy\nRobert McWade as Webster Parsons\nJames Bush as Tom Ogden\nMargaret Hamilton as  Minnie Oddvar Bull Tuhus( born 14 December 1940) is a Norwegian film director, script writer and television worker.

The main roles are played by Rune Dybedahl, Liv Bernhoft Osa, Jörn Donner, Sverre Anker Ousdal, Per Theodor Haugen, and Rolf Søder.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nHockeyfeber is a story about not only clashes on the ice, but also about life as it fades in the harsh environment in which amateur sports take place. The film depicts the sports environment in good and bad ways, and it shows how tough and cynical the demands on the athletes become when winning the sponsors' favor is most important.\nThe ice hockey team Manglerud Star is moving down from the first division. Ricky (Rune Dybedahl) is one of the players on the team, and he falls in love with Vera (Liv Bernhoft Osa), who is involved with horses. It is not easy for Ricky to combine his relationship with Vera with the intense training needed to qualify for the next season. In addition, the difficult situation makes the players depressed, and both friendship and the joy of the sport are at stake. However, the managers have many ideas, and they are eager to adopt new methods of raising funds for the club. They also want to acquire a coach with an international profile. Recruiting players, sponsorship, and increasingly tougher competition make it difficult to maintain the team spirit and the community between the team members.\nProblems related to money, violence in sports, and private life are touched upon in this film, in which the hockey environment is presented realistically.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHockeyfeber is the last of three youth films directed by Oddvar Bull Tuhus in the early 1980s. In 1980 he released 1958, which was about the Sinsen gang, and in 1982 Fifty-Fifty, a film about broken dreams, boring jobs, and dance band success. Tore Torell was engaged as a consultant for the film.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAftenposten's Øyvind Thorsen wrote the following: \"At first, it is somewhat annoying that the players are amateurs at repartee and expression, and their words are often lost in mumbling, but eventually the film becomes so focused that you forget this. Liv Bernhoft Osa and Jørn Donner also add weight to the film. Donner, as the Finnish coach, is unyielding, strong-willed, and arrogant, but well aware of his capacity, and that those that follow his orders will win.\" Dagbladet's Thor Ellingsen was more enthusiastic in his review, and wrote the following: \"With Hockeyfeber, Tuhus continues the thread from 1958 and Fifty-Fifty, in which he portrayed Norwegian youth cultures and tackles subjects that filmmakers have traditionally neglected in Norway. He has gotten better with each of these films, and I think Hockeybefer is simply the best of his seven feature films to date. The cinematographer Halvor Næss and editor Bjørn Breigutu contribute significantly to the successful result.\" Jan Simonsen in the film magazine Z was more mixed in his views and wrote the following in 1983: \"Young people are affected by a number of diseases these days. We have noted both Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance fever, and several other variations. Now they are also exposed to a Norwegian virus: Hockey fever! Z's reviewer finds it natural to continue the diagnosis tradition from the blessed Filmavisa. He finds the film's theme interesting, but sees weaknesses in the dramaturgy and the representation of the ice hockey game itself.\"\nThe film received a \"die throw\" of 4 from Dagbladet in 1996.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHockeyfeber at IMDb\nHockeyfeber at the National Library of Norway\nHockeyfeber at Filmfront The Old Soak is a 1926 American silent crime drama directed by Edward Sloman. The film stars Jean Hersholt, George J. Lewis, and June Marlowe, and is based on a 1922 Broadway play of the same title by Don Marquis. The play was later adapted into the 1937 release\" The Good Old Soak\" starring Wallace Beery. \" The Old Soak\" is now presumed lost. However, a 16 mm reduction positive print may exist in a private collection. Ted Healy (born Charles Ernest Lee Nash; October 1, 1896 – December 21, 1937) was an American vaudeville performer, comedian, and actor. Though he is chiefly remembered as the creator of The Three Stooges and the style of slapstick comedy that they later made famous, he had a successful stage and film career of his own and was cited as a formative influence by several later comedy stars.    Early life  Sources conflict on Healy's precise birth name (most sources indicate he was born Charles Ernest Lee Nash) but according to baptismal records, he was born Ernest Lea Nash on October 1, 1896, in Kaufman, Texas, to Charles McKinney Nash and Mary Eugenia (McGinty) Nash. He attended Holy Innocents School in Houston before the family, including his elder sister, Elizabeth Marcia Nash (March 7, 1895 – October 31, 1972), who later appeared in two 1930s films in small roles under the stage name Marcia Healy (The Sitter Downers and The Great Ziegfeld), moved to New York in 1908. While in New York, he attended high school at De La Salle Institute. Nash initially intended to become a businessman but eventually decided on the stage.    Show business career   Nash made his first foray into show business in 1912 at the age of 15 when he and childhood friend Moe Howard joined the Annette Kellerman Diving Girls, a vaudeville act that included four boys. The act ended quickly after an accident on stage, and Nash and Howard went their separate ways. Nash then developed a vaudeville act and adopted the stage name Ted Healy. Healy's act was a hit, and he soon expanded his role as a comedian and master of ceremonies. In the 1920s, he was the highest-paid performer in vaudeville, making $9000 a week. He added performers to his stage show, including his new wife, Betty Brown (Betty Braun), and his German shepherd dog. The Healys' revue toured, listed on the marquee as Syncopated Toes, and when some of his acrobats quit in late 1923, Moe Howard answered the advertisement for replacements. Since Howard was not an acrobat, Healy cast his old friend as a stooge (a purported member of the audience who is picked, ostensibly at random, to come onstage). In the routine, Howard's appearance would end with Healy losing his trousers.    Ted Healy and his Southern Gentlemen  Howard's brother Shemp joined the act as a heckler in early 1924, but both Howards temporarily left show business in mid 1925. Ted and Betty were hired in June 1925 to star in the Broadway revue Earl Carroll Vanities of 1925. Ted brought some of the routines he developed with the Howard brothers, using three comics under contract to Carroll, (Dave Chasen, Kenneth Lackey, and Lou Warren). After a contract dispute whereby it was determined that Carroll was in the wrong, Ted and Betty left \"Vanities\" in October 1925 with Lou Warren and relaunched their Syncopated Toes revue, now retitled Fun in the Healy Manner. By January 1926 Shemp Howard had returned, and they successfully toured the country through the summer of 1926. Ted and Betty received another Broadway opportunity, this time from the Shubert Brothers, who hired them for The Passing Show of 1926, with Ted bringing Shemp and Lou along. Passing only enjoyed a preview tour and did not open on Broadway, but the Shuberts and Healy retooled the show into the successful A Night in Spain, with Phil Baker joining the Healys as its stars. For Spain, Ted utilized four stooges in some scenes: Shemp, Lou Warren, brother-in-law Sam \"Moody\" Braun, and Dick Hakins. Arriving on Broadway in May 1927 after four months of successful previews, Hakins fell ill and was replaced by comedy/specialty dancer Bobby Pinkus. In November 1927, Spain began a national tour with four months at Chicago's Four Cohans Theatre. Larry Fine, who had been working as the lead performer and house MC at Chicago's Rainbo Gardens nightclub and restaurant, was added to Healy's group of comics in late March 1928.  The Shuberts hired Ted to star in their new show A Night in Venice. Moe Howard returned to show business and joining Ted at his home in Connecticut to develop some comedy bits for the revue, which began rehearsals in January 1929. Shemp Howard also returned, but Larry Fine was in Atlantic City with his wife, waiting for the birth of his daughter. Healy hired comedy xylophonist Fred Sanborn in Fine's place.

Vasily Konstantinovich Blyukher (Russian: Васи́лий Константи́нович Блю́хер, romanized: Vasiliy Konstantinovich Blyukher; 1 December 1889 – 9 November 1938) was a Soviet military commander and Marshal of the Soviet Union. In 1938, Blyukher was arrested during the period of military purges under Joseph Stalin. He was tortured and blinded by Lavrentiy Beria and his men before succumbing to his injuries. His body was then incinerated on the orders of Stalin.    Early history   Blyukher was born into a Russian peasant family named Gurov, in the village of Barschinka in Yaroslavl Governorate. In the 19th century a landlord gave the nickname Blyukher to the Gurov family in commemoration of the famous Prussian Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher (1742–1819). As a teenager, he was employed at a machine works, but was arrested in 1910 for leading a strike, and sentenced to two years, eight months in prison. In 1914, Vasily Gurov — who later formally assumed Blyukher as his surname — was drafted into the army of the Russian Empire as a corporal but in 1915 was seriously wounded in the Great Retreat, and excused from military service. He then went to work in a factory in Kazan, where he joined the Bolshevik Party in 1916. He took part in the Russian Revolution of 1917 in Samara.    Civil War   In late November 1917 the Red Guard forces of Commander V. K. Sadlutskii and Commissar Blyukher moved from Samara to Chelyabinsk to suppress Alexander Dutov's revolt. Blyukher joined the Red Army in 1918 and soon became a commander. During the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, he was one of the outstanding figures on the Bolshevik side. After the Czech Legion revolt started in May 1918, the 10,000-strong South Urals Partisan Army under Blyukher's command marched 1,500 km in 40 days (August–September 1918) of continuous fighting to attack White forces from the rear, then joined with regular Red Army units. For this achievement in September 1918, he became the first recipient of the Order of the Red Banner (later he was awarded it four more times: twice in 1921 and twice in 1928), the citation read: \"The raid made by Comrade Blyukher's forces under impossible conditions can only be equated with  Suvorov's crossings in Switzerland.\" After Blyukher's troops rejoined the Red Army lines in the 3rd Red Army area of the Eastern Front, his force was reorganised as the 51st Rifle Division, which he later led to further triumphs against Baron  Wrangel in November 1920. After the Civil War he served as military commander of the Far Eastern Republic from 1921 to 1922. From December 1921, he took personal command of the campaign to remove the remnants of anti-Bolshevik forces east of the Amur river. In 1922−1924, he served as the commander of the Petrograd military district.    Far East command   From 1924 to 1927 Blyukher was a Soviet military adviser in China, where he used the name Galen (after the name of his wife, Galina) while attached to Chiang Kai-shek's military headquarters. He was responsible for the military planning of the Northern Expedition which began the Kuomintang unification of China. Among those he instructed in this period was Lin Biao, later a leading figure in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Chiang allowed Blyukher to \"escape\" after his anti-communist purge. On his return he was given command of the Ukrainian Military District, and then in 1929 he was transferred to the vitally important military command in the Far Eastern Military District, known as the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army (OKDVA). Based at Khabarovsk, Blyukher exercised a degree of autonomy in the Far East unusual for a Soviet military commander. With Japan steadily extending its grip on China and hostile to the Soviet Union, the Far East was an active military command. In the Russo-Chinese Chinese Eastern Railroad War of 1929–30 he defeated Chinese warlord forces in a quick campaign. For this outstanding achievement he became the first recipient of the Order of the Red Star in September 1930, and became popularly known as the \"Red Napoleon\". In 1935 he was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union. The Old Soak is a 1926 American silent comedy crime film directed by Edward Sloman. The film stars Jean Hersholt, George J.

He was the second husband of Hannah Arendt whom he had first met in Paris in 1936. During his life in America, Blücher traveled in popular academic circles and appears prominently in the lives of various New York intellectuals.    Biography  Blücher was born in Berlin among the poor working class of the city. He was a member of the Communist Party of Germany until 1928, but soon rejected Stalinism and left the party in protest of its Stalinist policies. He then became a member of a small anti-Stalinist group called the Communist Party Opposition. Dwight Macdonald would later describe Blücher's political identity as a \"true, hopeless anarchist.\"  He is remembered as a philosopher, yet he \"was an autodidact who had gone to night school but never graduated, a bohemian who until 1933 had worked in German cabarets.\" As a Communist, Blücher had to flee Germany following the rise of National Socialism. He escaped without the necessary travel documents across the Czech border, the same route taken by his wife. During his time in France he became close friends with Walter Benjamin, through whom he met Arendt. He married Hannah Arendt in France, and they emigrated to New York City in 1941. Heinrich Blücher began teaching philosophy at Bard College in 1952, despite having no post-secondary education, continuing for seventeen years, as well as at the New School for Social Research. While there he continued to hold radical anti-establishment views, stating in a lecture that \"The C.I.A. has infiltrated the National Student Organization. That means we are being bribed, we are being used, and we are no longer academicians any more.\" Later in the same lecture he insisted, that if \"what the government says must be right, it must be spread, and no dissent shall be possible. If they call that consensus, then to hell with it.\" He argued that America was now \"doing what the others (the totalitarians, the Russians) did all along.\" He died of a heart attack at the age of 71, in the apartment he shared with Arendt at 370 Riverside Drive, New York City. His wife Hannah Arendt was later buried alongside him at Bard College Cemetery.    Marriage to Hannah Arendt  Arendt and Blücher met in 1936, in a café along the rue Soufflot frequented by their friend Walter Benjamin and other German émigrés. Arendt was twenty-nine, Blücher thirty-seven. Both were fugitives from the Nazis. Blücher was considered a communist militant, thus he lacked the requisite permis de séjour to work and had to move frequently from hotel to hotel. Both were still formally married, but separated from their spouses. Due to the pressures of lacking citizenship and their marital status, Blücher would not marry Arendt until 1940, despite accounts reporting that they fell in love immediately. The marriage would last until his death, however, would change in relation and normalcy over time. By 1952, the marriage was polyamorous; in a letter to Blücher, Arendt expressed joy at this, writing, \"Yes, love, our hearts have really grown toward each other and our steps go in unison. These fools who think themselves loyal if they give up their active lives and bind themselves together into an exclusive One; then they have no common life but generally no life at all. If it weren't so risky, one should one day tell the world what a marriage really is.\"    Political thought  Blücher encouraged his wife to become involved with Marxism and political theory, though ultimately her use of Karl Marx was in no way orthodox, as shown in such works as The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) and The Human Condition (1958). Blücher also coined the term \"the anti-political principle\" to describe totalitarianism's destruction of a space of resistance — a term taken up both by Arendt and Karl Jaspers. Blücher believed, alongside Arendt and Martin Heidegger, that science held a corresponding mindset which threatened first religion, and now philosophy. He argued that this belief, which he saw best displayed in Alfred North Whitehead's Science and the Modern World, was the same belief as the pre-socratic thinker Heraclitus. Namely, he saw science and Heraclitus agreeing on the claim that \"there is a rational order of things that is also a natural order of things\". Walter Ruben may refer to:\n\nJ.

Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, Fürst von Wahlstatt (German pronunciation: [ˈɡɛphaʁt ˈleːbəʁɛçt fɔn ˈblʏçɐ]; 21 December 1742 – 12 September 1819), Graf (count), later elevated to Fürst (sovereign prince) von Wahlstatt, was a Prussian Generalfeldmarschall (field marshal). He earned his greatest recognition after leading his army against Napoleon I at the Battle of the Nations at Leipzig in 1813 and the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Blücher was born in Rostock, the son of a retired army captain. His military career began in 1758 as a hussar in the Swedish Army. He was captured by the Prussians in 1760 during the Pomeranian Campaign and thereafter joined the Prussian Army, serving as a hussar officer for Prussia during the remainder of the Seven Years' War. In 1773, Blücher was forced to resign by Frederick the Great for insubordination. He worked as a farmer until the death of Frederick in 1786, when Blücher was reinstated and promoted to colonel. For his success in the French Revolutionary Wars, Blücher became a major general in 1794. He became a lieutenant general in 1801 and commanded the cavalry corps during the Napoleonic Wars in 1806. War broke out between Prussia and France again in 1813 and Blücher returned to active service at the age of 71. He became a leading hero of the Germans in the struggle to end foreign domination of their lands. He was appointed full general over the Prussian field forces and clashed with Napoleon at the Battles of Lützen and Bautzen. Later he won a critical victory over the French at the Battle of Katzbach. Blücher commanded the Prussian Army of Silesia at the Battle of the Nations where Napoleon was decisively defeated. For his role, Blücher was made a field marshal and received his title of Prince of Wahlstatt. After Napoleon's return in 1815, Blücher took command of the Prussian Army of the Lower Rhine and coordinated his force with that of the British and Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington. At the Battle of Ligny, he was severely injured and the Prussians retreated. After recovering, Blücher resumed command and joined Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo, with the intervention of Blücher's army playing a decisive role in the final allied victory. Blücher was made an honorary citizen of Berlin, Hamburg and Rostock. Known for his fiery personality, he was nicknamed Marschall Vorwärts (\"Marshal Forward\") by his soldiers because of his aggressive approach in warfare. Along with Paul von Hindenburg, he was the most highly decorated Prussian-German soldier in history: Blücher and Hindenburg are the only Prussian-German military officers to have been awarded the Star of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross. A statue once stood in the square that bore his name, Blücherplatz, in Breslau (today Wrocław).    Biography     Early life  Blücher was born on 21 December 1742 in Rostock, a Baltic port in northern Germany, then in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. His father Christian Friedrich von Blücher (1696–1761), was a retired army captain, and his family belonged to the nobility and had been landowners in northern Germany since at least the 13th century. His mother was Dorothea Maria von Zülow (1702–1769), who also belonged to an old noble family from Mecklenburg. Gebhard began his military career at the age of 16, when he joined the Swedish Army as a hussar. At the time, Sweden was at war with Prussia in the Seven Years' War. Blücher took part in the Pomeranian campaign of 1760, where Prussian hussars captured him in a skirmish. The colonel of the Prussian regiment, Wilhelm Sebastian von Belling (a distant relative), was impressed with the young hussar and had him join his own regiment. Blücher took part in the later battles of the Seven Years' War, and as a hussar officer, gained much experience in light cavalry work. In peace, however, his ardent spirit led him into excesses of all kinds, such as the mock execution of a priest suspected of supporting Polish uprisings in 1772. As a result, he was passed over for promotion to major. Check and Double Check is a 1930 American pre-Code comedy film produced and released by RKO Radio Pictures, based on the Amos 'n' Andy radio show. The title was derived from a catchphrase associated with the show. Directed by Melville W. Brown, from a screenplay by Bert Kalmar, J. Walter Ruben, and Harry Ruby, it starred Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll in blackface, in the roles of Amos Jones and Andy Brown, respectively, which they had created for the radio show.  The film also featured Duke Ellington and his Cotton Club Orchestra.    Plot  Amos and Andy run the \"Fresh Air Taxicab Company, Incorpulated\" [sic], so named because their one taxi has no top. Their old vehicle has broken down, causing a traffic jam. Stuck in the traffic jam are John Blair and his wife, who were on their way to meet an old family friend, Richard Williams, at the train station. When the Blairs don't show up, Williams makes his own way to their house and meets their daughter, Jean, who was also his childhood sweetheart. The two reignite their old flame, much to the chagrin of Ralph Crawford, who has been attempting to woo Jean himself. That night, Amos and Andy plan to attend a meeting at their lodge, the Mystic Knights of the Sea. Brother member Kingfish hires them to transport Duke Ellington and his Cotton Club band to a party being given at the Blair estate. Meanwhile, Richard confides to John Blair his feelings for his daughter, and states that he has no intention of pursuing Jean unless he can afford to start his own business to support them. Richard's family lost all their money after the death of his father. Richard's grandfather used to own a large home in Harlem, and Richard hopes to find the deed to it, so that he can sell it for the capital needed to start his business. He thinks the deed must be hidden somewhere on the property itself. Unknown to Blair or Richard, Ralph is eavesdropping on their conversation. Richard runs into Amos and Andy, who used to work for his father down south, and they are all happy to see one another. Having delivered their fare, the two cab drivers rush back to town to attend their lodge meeting. The lodge has an annual tradition where a pair of members must spend a night in a haunted house in Harlem and find a document, labeled \"Check and Double Check.\"  Once they find it, they are to replace it, in a different location, with their own version, for the lodge members to find the following year. The haunted house in question in none other than the house previously owned by Richard's grandfather. As Amos and Andy are searching for their document, Ralph is also in the house with several of his cohorts, searching for the deed, in order to thwart Richard's chances with Jean. Amos and Andy find their document, but then realize they didn't bring any other paper to write their message to their lodge brothers. In searching for something to write on, they stumble on the deed to premises. As they are about to write their message on the back, they are interrupted by Ralph and his friends, who believe that the two have found the deed. In the confusion which ensues, the cab drivers hand over what everyone believes is the deed, before they scamper out of the building. However, when they return to the lodge, they realize that they had given the \"Check and Double Check\" paper to Ralph, instead of the deed. They don't know the importance of the document they have, but they recognized Richard's grandfather's signature on it, and intend to deliver it to Richard the following day. After failing to find the deed, a heartbroken Richard leaves for the railway station, intending to return home. Amos and Andy arrive at the Blair house too late to give him the deed, but race to the station and are able to hand over the deed just before Richard's train leaves. Now with the deed, Richard can sell the house, open his business, and marry Jean.    Cast   (Cast list as per AFI database)    Production   The making of the picture posed several problems. Perhaps foremost was the fact that the characters of the program were portrayed as African Americans but were in fact entirely voiced by whites. This had posed no problem on the radio, but obviously would not be suitable for a film where the actors could be seen as well as heard. Rather than hire black actors for the roles and instruct them to imitate the stereotypical voices used by the radio performers, program creators Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll performed the roles themselves in blackface. Another problem was the attempt to base a full-length picture on a 15-minute-long radio program.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

As QR code, Han Xin code consists of black squares and white square spaces arranged in a square grid on a white background. It has four finder patterns and other markers which allow to recognize it with camera-based readers. Han Xin code contains Reed–Solomon error correction with ability to read corrupted images. At this time, it is issued as ISO/IEC 20830:2021. The main advantage (and invention requirement), comparable to QR code, is an embedded ability to natively encode Chinese characters instead of Japanese in QR code. Han Xin code in maximal 84 version (189×189 size) allows to encode 7827 numeric characters, 4350 English text characters, 3261 bytes and 1044–2174 Chinese characters (it depends on Unicode region). Han Xin code encodes full ISO/IEC 646 Latin characters instead of restricted amount Latin characters which is supported by QR code. It makes Han Xin code more suitable for English text encoding or GS1 Application Identifiers data encoding. Additionally, Han Xin code can encode Unicode characters from other languages with special Unicode mode,: 5.4.12  which has embedded lossless compression for UTF-8 characters set and Extended Channel Interpretation support. Han Xin code has special compactification mode for URI encoding and can reduce barcode size which encodes links to web pages.    History and standards  Chinese company The Article Numbering Center of China (中国物品编码中心 in Chinese) during 10-th Five-year plans of China started research of own QR code replacement to remove Japanese monopoly in 2D barcodes. In 2007, the new barcodes standard, at this time known as Han Xin code, published as GB/T 21049-2007 with the name Chinese-sensible code. In 2011, USA company Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility (AIM) brought out ISS Han Xin Code symbology as official encoding standard and published it in the own store. In 2015, group of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 31 started implementation of Han Xin code as international standard and published it as ISO/IEC 20830:2021 in 2021. In 2022 Chinese-sensible code standard was reviewed as GB/T 21049-2022 and renamed as Han Xin code to be compliant with ISO standard. Set of patents is registered in United States Patent and Trademark Office related with Han Xin code encoding and decoding:  European Patent Office EP3330887B1 by Fujian Landi Commercial Equipment Co Ltd  \"Chinese-sensitive code feature pattern detection method and system\" United States Patent US10095903B2 by Ingenico Fujian Technology Co Ltd  \"Block decoding method and system for two-dimensional code\" United States Patent US10528781B2 by Ingenico Fujian Technology Co Ltd  \"Detection method and system for characteristic patterns of Han Xin codes\"    Application  Han Xin code can be used in the same way as QR code. At this time Han Xin code is used mostly in China, because it has embedded encoding ability to encode Chinese characters. However, most of barcode printers and barcode scanners support Han Xin code. Han Xin code can be scanned on iOS and Android mobile devices and many barcode libraries support reading and writing Han Xin code. Main advantages of Han Xin code are:  ability to encode Chinese characters with embedded methods; Extended Channel Interpretation support; embedded method for compact UTF-8 encoding with embedded lossless compression; embedded method for URI compact encoding; compact GS1 Application Identifiers data encoding comparable to QR code; full ISO/IEC 646 support for compact numeric and text encoding.    Barcode design   Han Xin code represents data in black and white square modules, where dark module is a binary one and a light module is a zero. Additionally, Han Xin code can be encoded in inverse colors,: 4.1.2  but this option in many barcode readers is disabled by default. Black and white modules are arranged into square region with sizes from 23 × 23 modules (Version 1) to 189 × 189 modules (Version 84). As QR code, Han Xin code does not have rectangular versions like DataMatrix has and this restricts usage of Han Xin code in some cases. Han Xin( died 196 BC) was a military general who served Liu Bang during the Chu – Han Contention and contributed greatly to the founding of the Han dynasty. Han Xin was named as one of the\" Three Heroes of the early Han dynasty\", along with Zhang Liang and Xiao He. Han Xin is best remembered as a brilliant military leader for the strategies and tactics he employed in warfare, some of which became the origins of certain Chinese idioms. In recognition of Han Xin's contributions, Liu Bang conferred the titles of\" King of Qi\" on him in 203 BC and\" King of Chu\" in the following year. However, Liu Bang feared Han Xin's growing influence and gradually reduced his authority, demoting him to\" Marquis of Huaiyin\" in late 202 BC. In 196 BC, Han Xin was accused of participating in a rebellion and lured into a trap and executed on Empress Lü Zhi's orders. Han Xin (simplified Chinese: 韩信; traditional Chinese: 韓信; pinyin: Hán Xìn; Wade–Giles: Han2Hsin4; ? – early 196 BCE) was a Chinese military general and politician who served Liu Bang during the Chu–Han Contention and contributed greatly to the founding of the Han dynasty. Han Xin was named as one of the \"Three Heroes of the early Han dynasty\" (Chinese: 漢初三傑), along with Zhang Liang and Xiao He. Han Xin is best remembered as a brilliant military leader for the strategies and tactics he employed in warfare, some of which became the origins of certain Chinese idioms, he was undefeated in battle and for his accomplishments he was considered the \"God of War\". In recognition of Han Xin's contributions, Liu Bang conferred the titles of \"King of Qi\" on him in 203 BCE and \"King of Chu\" in the following year. However, Liu Bang feared Han Xin's growing influence and gradually reduced his authority, demoting him to \"Marquis of Huaiyin\" in late 202 BCE. In early 196 BCE, Han Xin was accused of participating in a rebellion, lured into a trap and executed on Empress Lü Zhi's orders.    Early life  Han Xin was born in Huaiyin (modern-day Jiangsu Province), which was an area of Chu during the warring states. According to legend, he may have been a descendant of the Han Sect of the Han Kingdom, but he was incredibly poor. The people from his hometown say that when his mother died, he did not have enough money to give her a proper burial. Regardless, he still searched until he came across a high and raised plot of land, thinking that one day, he could settle ten thousand households here to live and guard over his mother's grave. Because he was unable to obtain a government post nor become a merchant, he lived a life of destitution and was despised by those around him, as he often relied on others for his meals. He especially often went to the 亭長 (Chief) of Nanchang Pavilion for food, and as months passed the Chief's wife increasing began to hate Han Xin. At one point, she cooked and ate very early in the morning, so that when Han Xin arrived, there was no more food. Han Xin understood that he was no longer welcome and never visited them again. Once, when he was suffering from hunger, he met an old woman washing clothes by the river who provided him food. She did so for all the dozen days that she had laundry to do. Han Xin was incredibly delighted and promised to heavily repay her for her kindness. She, however, scolded him, saying: \"A young man such as you cannot feed himself. I take pity that you are a descendant of nobility and so I feed you. I did not do so expecting anything in return!\" A youngster from a butcher's family in Huaiyin would humiliate Han Xin, making fun of him by saying that despite Han Xin being tall and carrying around a sword, Han Xin was actually a coward. He said in front of a crowd: \"If you do not fear death; stab me. If you fear death; come crawl between my legs.\" Han Xin gave it some thought, and eventually decided to crawl between the hooligan's legs. Because of this, he was mocked by all the town for his cowardice. Several years later, after becoming the King of Chu, Han Xin returned to his hometown. He found the woman who fed him and rewarded her with 1,000 taels of gold. He found the Chief of Nanchang Pavilion and gave him a hundred coins, saying, \"You are not a good person. You do good things but your generosity is limited.\" Han Xin also found the hooligan and appointed the hooligan as a zhongwei (中尉; equivalent to a present-day lieutenant). He to his subordinates: \"This man is a hero. Do you think I could not have killed him when he humiliated me? I would not become famous even if I killed him then. Hence, I endured the humiliation to preserve my life to achieve great things in the future.\"    Service Under Xiang Yu  In 209 BC, Han Xin joined Xiang Liang's rebel army when rebellions erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Han Xin continued serving Xiang Yu (Xiang Liang's nephew) after Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao. He was not placed in high regard and worked as a \"langzhong\" (郎中; sometimes translated as Captain of the Palace Guards). He constantly proposed strategies to Xiang Yu but was ignored.

He served Liu Bang (Emperor Gao), the founder of the Han dynasty, during the insurrection against the Qin dynasty, and fought on Liu's side in the Chu–Han Contention against Liu's rival, Xiang Yu. After the founding of the Han dynasty, Xiao He became the chancellor and held office until his death. For his contributions, he is also known as one of the \"Three Heroes of the early Han dynasty\" (漢初三傑), along with Han Xin and Zhang Liang. The Battle of Wei River (濰水之戰) was fought in 204 BC between the Han and a combined force of Qi and Western Chu. The famous General Han Xin led the Han force, while the Qi were led by Prince Tian Guang (田廣), and the Chu by Long Ju (龍且). It was one of the most important battles of the Chu-Han Contention. In 205 BC, Han Xin had captured most of the modern Hebei and Shanxi provinces, the principalities of Zhao, and Dai, and was starting to march on the principality of Qi. Prince Tian Guang, persuaded by noted diplomat Li Yiji (酈食其), had decided to acknowledge the leadership of Han and its king, Liu Bang. However, Liu Bang did not officially notify Han Xin. Ignorant of Prince Tian Guang's intentions, Han Xin decided to launch a surprise attack against Qi, under the counsel of Kuai Tong. Tian Guang's forces were completely surprised. Tian Guang fled and sought assistance from King Xiang Yu of Western Chu, pledging fealty. Xiang Yu sent a strong expeditionary force, including some elite cavalry, under Long Ju to relieve Qi. Han Xin knew that Long, noted for his personal bravery and fighting prowess, was too arrogant. The night before the battle, he set a trap for Long by building a makeshift dam with sandbags to lower the water level in the Wei river. Long was counselled to fight a slow battle of attrition since he had forces to spare (the force ratio was about 1:3 in favour of Chu). Long declined, believing he had overwhelming forces and that Han Xin was a coward, as a result of an incident when Han Xin served in the Chu forces. (Han Xin had crawled between the legs of some thugs to avoid a conflict when he was outnumbered.) The next morning, Han Xin marched across the lowered river and attacked Long's forces. Then, he made a strategic retreat by tricking Long into charging his army across the river. When about one quarter of the Chu army had crossed, Han signalled for his men to open the dam. That succeeded in drowning many of the Chu soldiers and isolating Long Ju, with only a fraction of his force. Cut off by the river, Long Ju had nowhere to go and was cut down in battle. The rest of the Chu army disintegrated, when Han Xin continued to press his attack. Prince Tian Guang fled and was eventually caught and killed. This battle was strategically significant since it cost Xiang Yu between half and a third of his forces, including many veterans, depleted Chu of important reserves and prevented any future possibility of Xiang Yu fighting successfully on two fronts. Eventually, Xiang Yu lost the war. It is not known why Xiang Yu did not lead the Chu army into battle himself to fight against the now well regarded Han Xin. Wei Zhaodu( 韋昭度)( died June 4, 895), courtesy name Zhengji( 正紀), formally the Duke of Qi( 岐公), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Xizong and Emperor Xizong's brother Emperor Zhaozong. With imperial power dwindling, Wei's fellow chancellor Cui Zhaowei, who associated with the warlords Li Maozhen, Wang Xingyu, and Han Jian, encouraged Li, Wang, and Han to march on the capital Chang'an, and the three warlords, once they arrived there, put Wei and fellow chancellor Li Xi to death.

In 2004, he was arrested in China following a dispute with Sichuan Changhong Electric, a supplier owned by the city of Mianyang and the province of Sichuan. Changhong accused him of defrauding them through bad checks. Ji was taken, according to an account by his lawyer, to the senior management and told, \"I decide whether you live or die.\" He has been held in China without charges. Ji's case highlighted an \"implicit racism\" in dealings with American businessmen. As a U.S. citizen he was not granted the same treatment by authorities as non-ethnically Chinese businessmen sharing the same nationality. Emperor Gaozu of Han (Chinese: 漢高祖; 256 – 1 June 195 BC), also known by his given name Liu Bang (劉邦), was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202 to 195 BC. He is considered by traditional Chinese historiography to be one of the greatest emperors in history, credited with establishing the first Pax Sinica, one of China's longest golden ages. Liu Bang was among the few dynastic originators to have born into a peasant family. He initially entered the Qin dynasty bureaucracy as a minor law enforcement officer in his home town Pei County, within the conquered state of Chu. During the political chaos following the death of Qin Shi Huang, who had been the first emperor in Chinese history, Liu renounced his civil service position and became a rebel leader taking up arms against the Qin. He outmanoeuvred rival rebel leader Xiang Yu to invade the Qin heartland and forced the surrender of the Qin ruler Ziying in 206 BC. After the fall of the Qin, Xiang Yu, as the de facto chief of the rebels, divided the former Qin empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms, with Liu Bang forced to accept control of the poor and remote region of Bashu (present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, and southern Shaanxi), and assuming the title \"King of Han\". Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the Three Qins, which started the Chu–Han Contention, a civil war between various forces seeking to inherit the Qin's former supremacy over China. In 202 BC, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the Battle of Gaixia, unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the founding emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and corvée labor, promoted Confucianism, and suppressed revolts by the lords of non-Liu vassal states, among many other actions. He also initiated the policy of heqin to maintain a de jure peace between the Han and the Xiongnu following the Han defeat at the Battle of Baideng in 200 BC. He died in 195 BC and was succeeded by his son, Liu Ying.    Birth and early life  According to the Han imperial mythology, Liu Bang's ancestors were the mythical Emperor Yao and the Yellow Emperor. Many ancient Chinese noble families claimed descent from the Yellow Emperor to justify their right to rule. Liu Bang was born during the late years of the Warring States period; his parents are only remembered as \"Liu Taigong\" and \"Liu Ao\" (劉媪; 'Old Madam Liu'). His family was from Zhongyang (中陽里) in the state of Chu. According to legend, Liu Bang was conceived after Liu Ao encountered a jiaolong dragon during a rainstorm. According to records, the young Liu was outspoken, charismatic, generous, and forbearing, but he had little interest in education or work and frequently ran into trouble with the law; he was dependent on his brother for subsistence and his father called him \"little rascal\". Later, he became good friends with Zhang Er (張耳; d. 202 BC), the magistrate of the nearby Waihuang County and former retainer of Lord Xinling. Liu lived with Zhang Er for several months, until the latter went into hiding after the conquest of Chu by Qin. Liu returned to Pei County. His close friends at the county office, Xiao He and Cao Shen, hid his delinquent behaviour and helped him to be appointed as the local sheriff (亭長) at Sishui Pavilion (泗水亭). Liu Bang forged close relationships with most of the local county bureaucrats, and earned a small reputation in the district. While performing corvée labour in the Qin capital at Xianyang, he witnessed Qin Shi Huang undertaking an inspection tour; the royal procession impressed Liu. Liu's wife, Lü Zhi, was the daughter of Lü Wen (呂文), a wealthy and influential gentry from Shanfu County. After moving to Pei County, Lü Wen held a feast for the local elite. Xiao He, who helped to collect gifts from the guests, declared that a seat inside the hall required gifts worth at least a thousand coins. Liu attended the feast without money, and made an offer of ten thousand coins which Xiao He realized was not serious. Nonetheless, Lü had Liu seated beside him based on appearance alone. Lü, further impressed by Liu in conversation, offered his daughter in marriage. The Chu–Han Contention (楚漢相爭), also known as the Chu–Han War (楚漢戰爭), was an interregnum period in Imperial China between the fall of the Qin dynasty and the establishment of the Western Han dynasty. After the third and last Qin ruler, Ziying, unconditionally surrendered to rebel forces in 206 BCE, the former Qin Empire was divided by rebel leader Xiang Yu into the Eighteen Kingdoms, which were ruled by various rebel leaders and surrendered Qin generals. A civil war soon broke out, most prominently between two major contending powers – Xiang Yu's Western Chu and Liu Bang's Han. Some of the other kingdoms also waged war among themselves but these were largely insignificant compared to the main conflict between Chu and Han. The war ended in 202 BCE with a Han victory at the Battle of Gaixia, during which Xiang Yu committed suicide after making a last stand. Liu Bang subsequently proclaimed himself emperor and established the Western Han dynasty.    Background   In 221 BCE, the Qin state conquered the other six major states – Han, Zhao, Yan, Wei, Chu and Qi – and unified China under the Qin dynasty with Qin Shi Huang as the first Qin emperor. After the emperor's death in 210 BCE, an uprising broke out in 209 BCE and lasted about five months before Qin forces defeated the rebels. Although the uprising was crushed, several other rebellions erupted consecutively over the next three years. The leaders of these rebellions were either supporters of pretenders to the thrones of the former six states conquered by Qin, or pretenders themselves. Among them, the most notable one was Xiang Yu, a Chu nobleman who wanted to restore the Chu state with King Huai II as its nominal ruler. Xiang Yu led Chu forces to victory over Qin forces at the Battle of Julu and declared himself \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" even though he still paid nominal allegiance to King Huai II. After the battle, he controlled nine commanderies in the former Liang and Chu territories, with the capital at Pengcheng (彭城; present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu). In the meantime, there was another notable rebel leader, Liu Bang, who had originally joined Xiang Yu's rebel army but had since led his own rebel forces. Liu Bang managed to advance into the Guanzhong region, the heartland of the Qin dynasty, and faced minimal resistance along the way as the bulk of the Qin forces had gone to fight at the Battle of Julu. In 206 BCE, the last Qin emperor, Ziying, surrendered the capital Xianyang to Liu Bang, thus bringing an end to the Qin dynasty. Liu Bang treated Ziying respectfully and forbade his followers from harming civilians and looting Xianyang. However, when Xiang Yu eventually arrived in the Guanzhong region, Liu Bang was pressured into ceding control of the region to Xiang Yu despite an earlier agreement between them that whoever occupied Guanzhong first would be the \"King of Guanzhong\". After Xiang Yu took control of Xianyang, he allowed his troops to pillage and plunder the city and ordered the destruction of the Epang Palace. Xiang Yu also attempted to assassinate Liu Bang at the Feast at Swan Goose Gate but Liu Bang survived and escaped due to Xiang Yu's indecisiveness. Later, Xiang Yu forced Liu Bang to relocate from Guanzhong to the remote and underdeveloped Bashu region (present-day Chongqing and Sichuan). Xiang Yu then divided the former Qin Empire into numerous vassal states, each ruled by either a rebel leader or a surrendered Qin general. The states were collectively known as the Eighteen Kingdoms, with the Kingdom of Chu as the nominal sovereign power over the other kingdoms. Xiang Yu also honoured King Huai II with a higher title, \"Emperor Yi of Chu\". Shortly after that, he exiled the figurehead emperor to Chen County (郴縣; present-day Chenzhou, Hunan), and secretly ordered Ying Bu, the King of Jiujiang, to intercept and assassinate Emperor Yi along the way.    Initial stages   In 206 BCE, after the former Qin Empire was divided into the Eighteen Kingdoms, Liu Bang was made King of Han and relocated to the Bashu region (present-day Chongqing and Sichuan) along with 30,000 troops and thousands of civilians.

Medals may be awarded in the disciplines of men's singles, women's singles, ice dance, and pair skating on the senior, junior, novice, and pre-novice levels. The results are split by country in order to form each country's national podiums.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrom 2007 to 2009, the Czech Figure Skating Championships and Slovak Figure Skating Championships were held simultaneously and the results were then split by country. The top three skaters from each country formed their national podiums. In the 2008–09 figure skating season, Poland joined the two countries, forming the Three Nationals Figure Skating Championships. Since the 2013–14 figure skating season, Hungary joined the three countries, forming the Four Nationals Figure Skating Championships. The only exception since 2013 was during the 2020–21 figure skating season, where Hungary held their national championships separately.\n\n\n== Senior medalists ==\n\n\n=== Men ===\n\n\n=== Women ===\n\n\n=== Pairs ===\n\n\n=== Ice dance ===\n\n\n== Junior medalists ==\n\n\n=== Pairs ===\n\n\n=== Ice dance ===\n\n\n== References == Jingxing Pass is one of the major mountain passes on the Taihang Mountains, site of the famous Battle of Tao River or Battle of Jingxing where the famous general Han Xin( 韓信) scored one of his many victories against superior forces. Xin, King of Hán (died 196 BC), also known as Hán Xin and as Hán Wang Xin, was a descendant of the royal family of the state of Hán during the Warring States period of China. After the establishment of the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu granted Hán Xin the title of \"King of Hán\" (韓王). In 201 BC, Hán Xin was suspected of conspiring with the Xiongnu to attack the Han Empire and decided to defect to the Xiongnu. He was killed in action during a battle against the Han army in 196 BC.    Biography     Early life  Hán Xin was a grandson of King Xiang of the Hán state of the Warring States period. Around 207 BC, Hán Xin joined Liu Bang's rebel army in Henan and joined him in overthrowing the Qin dynasty. After the fall of the Qin dynasty in 206 BC, Xiang Yu divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms and granted Liu Bang the title of \"King of Hàn\" (漢王) and relocated him to the remote Ba and Shu regions around present-day Chongqing and Sichuan.    Chu–Han contention   In late 206 BC, Liu Bang led his army out of Bashu to attack the Three Qins. This marked the beginning of a four-year-long power struggle for supremacy over China between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu, historically known as the Chu–Han Contention. At that time, the Hán kingdom was ruled by Zheng Chang, who had been appointed King of Hán (韓王) by Xiang Yu. Liu Bang promised to help Hán Xin become the King of Hán, and appointed him as a general before sending him to attack Zheng Chang. By the following year, Hán Xin conquered more than ten cities in the Hán kingdom and forced Zheng Chang to surrender. Liu Bang recognised Hán Xin as the new King of Hán. In 204 BC, after Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu at the Battle of Xingyang, Hán Xin was captured by Xiang Yu and forced to surrender. Later, he managed to escape and return to Liu Bang's side. Hán Xin was reinstated as the King of Hán and became a vassal of the Han dynasty after Liu Bang defeated Xiang Yu in 202 BC and became Emperor of China. He was granted the lands around Yingchuan (穎川; in present-day Henan) as his fief and built his capital at Yangzhai (陽翟; present-day Yuzhou City, Henan).    Flight to Xiongnu  In 201 BC, Liu Bang (Emperor Gaozu) felt that Hán Xin's fief was in a strategic location and was worried that Hán might pose a threat to the Han Empire. Hence, under the pretext of sending him to defend the northern border, the emperor had Hán Xin relocated to Taiyuan Commandery, with Jinyang (晉陽; present-day Taiyuan, Shanxi) as the new Hán capital. Hán Xin requested to have his capital at Mayi (present-day Shuozhou, Shanxi) instead and the emperor approved. When the Xiongnu attacked Mayi, Emperor Gaozu suspected Hán Xin of secretly conspiring with the Xiongnu so he sent an imperial edict to Hán Xin to reprimand him. Hán Xin was afraid of being exterminated so he formed an alliance with the Xiongnu against the Han Empire. In late 200 BC, Emperor Gaozu personally led the Han army to attack Hán Xin and forced him to retreat to Xiongnu territory. However, the Han army lost to the Xiongnu at the Battle of Baideng and retreated. Hán Xin and the Xiongnu constantly raided the northern border in the following years.    Death  In 197 BC, Hán Xin sent Wang Huang (王黃) to convince Chen Xi to rebel, which he did. In 196 BC, Hán Xin allied with the Xiongnu again to attack the Han Empire, and occupied the town of Canhe (參合; possibly the place where a decisive battle occurred 600 years later). Chai Wu (柴武), the Han general assigned to fend off the invasion, wrote a letter to Hán Xin, asking him to surrender to the Han Empire. Chai Wu also told Hán Xin that he had a chance of being pardoned since his betrayal was not as serious as others' so the emperor would be more inclined to forgive him. However, Hán Xin refused, claiming he had already committed high treason three times by allying with the Xiongnu on three occasions to attack the Han Empire. The 2012 Three National Figure Skating Championships included the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland. The event was hosted by the Czech association in Ostrava on December 16–17, 2011. Medals were awarded in the disciplines of men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing on the senior level. Some junior and novice-level events were also held.\nThe results were split by country; the three highest-placing skaters from each country in each discipline formed their national podiums. The results were among the criteria used to determine international assignments. It was the fourth consecutive season that the three countries held their national championships jointly.\n\n\n== Medals summary ==\n\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\n\n\n=== Slovakia ===\n\n\n=== Poland ===\n\n\n== Senior results ==\n\n\n=== Men ===\n\n\n=== Ladies ===\n\n\n=== Pairs ===\n\n\n=== Ice dancing ===\n\n\n== Junior results ==\n\n\n=== Pairs ===\nNo short program.\n\n\n=== Ice dancing ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n2012 Three National Championships results\nJunior results: Czech (PDF), Polish Archived 2016-03-04 at the Wayback Machine, Slovak\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"
