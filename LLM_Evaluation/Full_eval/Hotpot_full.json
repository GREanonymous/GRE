Celtic Woman is an all-female Irish musical ensemble, formed in 2004 for a one-time event held in Dublin, Ireland. They started touring internationally as a group after multiple airings on PBS helped to boost the group's popularity.Celtic Woman released their debut album Celtic Woman in 2004 and have since released more than 20 albums. They have sold more than nine million records worldwide. The group's line-up has changed over the years, involving vocalists and a fiddler.

Downes also chose a repertoire that ranged from traditional Celtic tunes to modern songs.This performance was first broadcast on PBS during March 2005 in the United States. Within weeks the group's eponymous debut album, Celtic Woman, reached No. 1 on Billboard's World Music chart, eventually breaking Andrea Bocelli's long-standing record of chart-topping longevity on 22 July 2006 by having stayed at No. 1 for 68 weeks. The album held the top position on the Billboard World Music chart for 81 weeks total. Much of the group's success in America has been credited to the extensive PBS publicity throughout 2005.

Downes chose a repertoire that ranged from traditional Celtic tunes to modern songs. An artistic director may refer to someone who directs a musical ensemble, and in this medium, is often abbreviated as simply Director.  The typical jobs of a musical artistic director are to choose repertoire for the ensemble, come up with an artistic vision for the group and also a long-term strategy for programming, and also to help choose performers if the ensemble is not pre-set.  An artistic director may also be—and often is—the conductor of the ensemble and a \"jack of all trades\", performing multiple roles and even managing the ensemble, although that role is often left to a Managing Director if financial resources are available.  A musical artistic director essentially mirrors a theatrical artistic director, albeit working in a different medium.

David Gregory (20 December 1625 – 1720) was a Scottish physician and inventor.  His surname is sometimes spelt as Gregorie, the original Scottish spelling.  He inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664.  Three of his twenty-nine children became mathematics professors.  He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \"being destructive to the human species\".  Copies and details of the model no longer exist.  Gregory's use of a barometer to predict farming-related weather conditions led him to be accused of witchcraft by Presbyterian ministers from Aberdeen, although he was never convicted. 1813 (MDCCCXIII) was a common year starting on Friday of the Gregorian calendar and a common year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar, the 1813th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 813th  year of the 2nd millennium, the 13th  year of the 19th century, and the  4th   year of the 1810s decade.

William Lawson, MLC (2 June 1774 – 16 June 1850) was an English born explorer, land owner, grazier and politician who migrated to Sydney, New South Wales in 1800.  With Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, he participated in the first successful crossing of the Blue Mountains by European settlers. Gregory Blaxland (17 June 1778 – 1 January 1853) was an English pioneer farmer and explorer in Australia, noted especially for initiating and co-leading the first successful crossing of the Blue Mountains by European settlers. Early life   Gregory Blaxland was born 17 June 1778 at Fordwich, Kent, England, the fourth son of John Blaxland, mayor from 1767 to 1774, whose family had owned estates nearby for generations, and Mary, daughter of Captain Parker, R.N. Gregory attended The King's School, Canterbury. In July 1799 in the church of St George the Martyr there, he married 20-year-old Elizabeth, daughter of John Spurdon; they had five sons and two daughters. The Blaxlands were friends of Sir Joseph Banks who appears to have strongly influenced the decision of Gregory and his eldest brother, John, to emigrate to Australia. The government promised them land, convict servants and free passages, in accord with its policy of encouraging 'settlers of responsibility and capital'. Leaving John to sell their Kent estates, Gregory sailed in the William Pitt on 1 September 1805 with his wife, the three children they then had, two servants, an overseer, a few sheep, seed, bees, tools, groceries and clothing. Blaxland and his family reached Sydney on 1 April 1806, where he sold many of the goods he brought with him very profitably, bought eighty head of cattle so as to enter the meat trade, located 2,000 acres (810 ha) of land at St Marys and was promised forty convict servants. Soon afterwards he also bought 450 acres (180 ha) at the Brush Farm (near Eastwood) from D'Arcy Wentworth for £1500, while also displaying some of his future characteristics by commencing litigation against the master of the William Pitt. A further parcel of 2,280 acres (920 ha) was granted for a farm at the South Creek.    Blue Mountains expedition   Early in 1813 Blaxland, who needed more grazing land, obtained the approval of Governor Lachlan Macquarie for an attempt to cross the Great Dividing Range, known as the Blue Mountains, following the mountain ridges, instead of following the rivers and valleys.

He secured the participation of William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth in the expedition, which was successful (though the expedition stopped short of actually crossing over the mountains) and enabled the settlers to access and use the land west of the mountains for farming. The crossing took 21 days, and only 6 days to return. Gregory Dark (born Gregory Hippolyte Brown on July 12, 1957 in Los Angeles) is an American film director, film producer, music video director, and screenwriter.

He has also been credited as Alexander Hippolyte, as Gregory Brown, and as The Dark Brothers. Gregory S. Butler (August 18, 1971, Suffield, Connecticut) is a visual effects supervisor.  He graduated from Suffield High School in 1989 and afterwards entered Hampshire College.  Despite his initial plans to study history, a work-study job with the audiovisual equipment in the library made him interested in film production.  Butler graduated in 1993 with a major in film, television and theater design.  Afterwards he moved to California to work for Industrial Light and Magic for 9 months, where after intern work he managed to become an assistant in the effects department, starting with assistant credits in \"The Mask\" and \"Forrest Gump\".  Following a job at Rocket Science Games until the company's bankruptcy in 1996, Butler went to Tippett Studio and did effects work in \"Starship Troopers\" and \"My Favorite Martian\", rising up to a technical director job, and Cinesite for \"Practical Magic\".  While reluctant at the requirement of moving to New Zealand, Butler was convinced by his writer-actor brother Jared to jump at the opportunity of working for Weta Digital in \"The Lord of the Rings\".  His biggest achievement was working in the creation of Gollum.  Butler also worked as a computer graphics supervisor on \"I, Robot\" before an invitation to work as an effects supervisor for the Moving Picture Company, in London.  He continues on MPC, but is now on the Vancouver office.  On January 24, 2012, he was nominated for an Academy Award for \"\". The Blue Mountains are a mountainous region and a mountain range located in New South Wales, Australia. The region is considered to be part of the western outskirts of the Greater Sydney area. The region borders on Sydney's main metropolitan area, its foothills starting about 50 kilometres (31 mi) west of centre of the state capital, close to Penrith. The public's understanding of the extent of the Blue Mountains is varied, as it forms only part of an extensive mountainous area associated with the Great Dividing Range. As defined in 1970, the Blue Mountains region is bounded by the Nepean and Hawkesbury rivers in the east, the Coxs River and Lake Burragorang to the west and south, and the Wolgan and Colo rivers to the north. Geologically, it is situated in the central parts of the Sydney Basin.The Blue Mountains Range comprises a range of mountains, plateau escarpments extending off the Great Dividing Range about 4.8 kilometres (3.0 mi) northwest of Wolgan Gap in a generally southeasterly direction for about 96 kilometres (60 mi), terminating at Emu Plains. For about two-thirds of its length it is traversed by the Great Western Highway, the Main Western railway line and the proposed Blue Mountains tunnel. Several established towns are situated on its heights, including Katoomba, Blackheath, Mount Victoria, and Springwood. The range forms the watershed between Coxs River to the south and the Grose and Wolgan rivers to the north. The range contains the Explorer Range and the Bell Range.Once considered impassable by settlers, the 1813 expedition by Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson opened up the interior to British settlement. Today, the Blue Mountains area includes the local government area of the City of Blue Mountains. Since the early 2010s, the region's biodiversity and infrastructure has been severely affected by massive bushfires of unprecedented size and impact. In 2018 8.4 million people visited the Blue Mountains. The Blue Mountains and Southern Highlands Basalt Forests is a prominent forest community within the ecoregion. Etymology Following European settlement of the Sydney area, the area was named the Carmarthen and Lansdowne Hills by Arthur Phillip in 1788. The Carmarthen Hills were in the north of the region and the Lansdowne Hills were in the south. The Division of Blaxland is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.  The division was created in 1949 and is named after Gregory Blaxland, a farmer and an early Australian explorer of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. The 1813 crossing of the Blue Mountains was the expedition led by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth, which became the first successful crossing of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales by European settlers.  The crossing enabled the settlers to access and use the land west of the mountains for farming, and made possible the establishment of Australia's first inland settlement at Bathurst. The 1813 crossing of the Blue Mountains was the expedition led by Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth, which became the first successful crossing of the Blue Mountains in New South Wales by European settlers. The crossing enabled the settlers to access and use the land west of the mountains for farming, and made possible the establishment of Australia's first inland colonial settlement at Bathurst.    Background  The European settlement at Sydney Cove, established in 1788 after the arrival of the First Fleet, grew rapidly. By the early 19th century, the Blue Mountains had become a barrier to the expansion of the colony, which required more farming land to meet its needs, particularly after the droughts of 1812 and 1813. The local indigenous people knew at least two routes by which to cross the mountains. The first was along Bilpin Ridge, later followed by Archibald Bell with the assistance of the local Darug people (now the location of Bells Line of Road), and the second was along Coxs River. Until 1813 however, the settlers remained unaware of how to cross the mountains despite several attempts, including two by Blaxland himself. Early in 1813 Blaxland, who wanted more grazing land, obtained the approval of Governor Lachlan Macquarie and approached Lawson and Wentworth to secure their participation in a new exploratory expedition following the mountain ridges.    Gregory Blaxland  Gregory Blaxland was born Sunday, 17 June 1778 in Kent, England. He sailed for Australia on Wednesday, 1 September 1805 with his wife, three children, two servants, an overseer, a few sheep, seed, tools, groceries, and clothing. When he reached Sydney he sold many of these items and made a profit which enabled him to buy eighty head of cattle so that he could breed cattle and sell the meat. He located 1,600 hectares of land that the government had promised to new settlers as well as forty convict servants and established his farm. He was also one of the first people to plant grapes in Australia and make wine, for which he was awarded a silver medal and later a gold one from the Royal Society of Arts, London. The town of Blaxland is named after him.    William Lawson  William Lawson was born in England, where he later trained to become a surveyor. He migrated to Sydney, Australia, arriving in 1800.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When will the current class of Australian multiple unit cars operated by NSW Trainlink in New South Wales enter service?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nNSW TrainLink is an Australian brand for the medium and long distance passenger rail and coach services of the New South Wales Government's transport authority, Transport for NSW.  NSW TrainLink services operate throughout New South Wales and extend into the neighbouring states and territories of Victoria, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory.  Train services are operated by the government's NSW Trains.  Coach services are contracted to private operators. Bomaderry is a single-platform intercity train station located in Bomaderry, New South Wales, Australia, on the South Coast railway line.  The station serves NSW TrainLink diesel multiple unit trains to Kiama.  Early morning and late night services to the station are provided by train replacement bus services.  A siding near the station is used by freight trains operated by the Manildra Group. The NSW TrainLink H sets, also referred to as the OSCAR (Outer Suburban Car) trains, are a class of electric multiple units currently operated by NSW TrainLink. Built by UGL Rail in Broadmeadow, the H sets first entered service under the CityRail brand in December 2006, with the last in December 2012. Their introduction allowed for the retirement of some V set carriages (DCM and DCT). As long-distance trains, the H sets share a similar overall layout and design to the previous G sets. Currently operating as 55 four-carriage sets, the H sets now operate between Sydney, Central Coast and Newcastle and between Sydney and the South Coast. Design There are many similarities between the H sets and the M sets, including improved external destination boards, internal destination boards displaying stopping patterns, Digital Voice Announcements, security cameras, and green target plates. The OSCARs also have additional features to increase comfort on the longer journeys they operate. These include high back seating covered with durable, vandal-proof woollen moquette fabric with padded head-rests, retractable footrests, luggage racks, aisle seat armrests and a wheelchair-accessible toilet. Wheelchair seating is available in the vestibules, while 3x2 seating is provided in the upper and lower deck sections. Carriage interiors were designed by Transport Design International.The OSCARs also include several new safety features. The doors on older rolling stock such as V sets are all unlocked at every station (even short platforms). V Sets have doors that must be slid open for alighting/boarding and G Sets have push buttons. However, on the H set, the guard is able to select the number of doors to be opened at a station. This feature is aimed at preventing incidents where passengers may fall from the carriage when stopped at a short platform. The H sets have been fitted with Dellner automatic couplers, compatible with the M sets and the Hunter railcars. They are able to absorb the impact of a collision, and the anti-climbers on the H sets will also reduce the force of impact. The trains also have a different body design. Instead of the entire body being of the same design, like the Tangara, the driver's cab is built like a protective cage, made of fibreglass and supported by a box section steel frame, which stretches to the end of the guard's door. The NSW TrainLink D sets, also referred to as the Mariyung trains, are a class of electric multiple units (EMU) being built to replace NSW TrainLink's Intercity EMU fleet. The trains will operate on services from Sydney to Newcastle, Lithgow and Kiama, allowing the retirement of NSW TrainLink's V set fleet, and freeing the H set fleet for reallocation to Sydney suburban services.The first trains were delivered in December 2019. After a protracted dispute between the government and the drivers' trade union over their safety, the first are scheduled to enter service in late 2024. History In May 2014, the Government of New South Wales announced its intention to purchase new carriages for the NSW TrainLink Intercity network. The new trains will replace the V sets and allow the H sets to be cascaded to Sydney Trains services. The class of trains were given the name Mariyung, a Dharug word for emu.In August 2014, expressions of interest from manufacturers were called for. The following parties responded:AlstomBombardier TransportationCAFDowner Rail / CNR ChangchunHyundai RotemStadler RailUGL Rail / Mitsubishi Electric / CSR CorporationIn July 2015, the government announced that Alstom, Downer/Changchun, Stadler, and UGL/Mitsubishi Electric/CSR had been shortlisted to tender. Following the merger of CSR and the parent company of Changchun Railway Vehicles, Hyundai Rotem replaced CSR as a partner in the UGL/Mitsubishi Electric consortium. The consortia provided two variants of their designs – a longer train and shorter train. The Hyundai Rotem/UGL/Mitsubishi Electric consortium was announced as the successful bidder in August 2016. The companies formed a joint venture called RailConnect to manage the project. The trains are being built by Hyundai Rotem's Changwon factory in South Korea.The initial contract covered the supply and maintenance of the 512 carriages which would consist of 77 4-car trains and 34 6-car trains, as well as the construction of the Kangy Angy Maintenance Centre. which was completed in August 2020. The maintenance contract runs for fifteen years from the delivery of the first train with an option for a five-year extension. The V sets are a class of Australian electric multiple unit operated by NSW TrainLink in New South Wales.  These stainless steel double deck trains operate on Interurban services on the Main Western line to Lithgow and Main Northern line to Hamilton (Newcastle).  These trains no longer operate on the NSW TrainLink South Coast Line to Kiama or Port Kembla due to the newer H sets. The V sets are a class of electric multiple units currently operated by NSW TrainLink. Built by Comeng between 1970 and 1989, the sets are of stainless steel construction, and are currently the oldest in the NSW TrainLink fleet. Initially introduced under the Public Transport Commission, only sets from 1977 and onwards remain in service, now operating on Intercity services to Lithgow and Newcastle.

The Xplorer is a diesel multiple unit train operated by NSW TrainLink on regional rail services in New South Wales, Australia from Sydney to Armidale, Moree, Broken Hill, Griffith and Canberra.  The first Xplorers entered service in October 1993, and are mechanically identical to but feature a higher level of passenger amenity than the Endeavour railcars.  All 23 carriages were built by ABB Transportation in Dandenong, Victoria. The Endeavour is a diesel multiple unit train operated by NSW TrainLink on passenger rail services in New South Wales, Australia on the Hunter Valley, Main Western, Southern Highlands and Illawarra lines.  They are mechanically identical to the Xplorers.  All 30 carriages were built by ABB Transportation in Dandenong, Victoria. Rail Corporation New South Wales (RailCorp) is a State-owned corporation of the State of New South Wales, Australia established under the \"Transport Administration Act 1988\" in 2004.  From 2004 until 2013, RailCorp operated passenger train services in New South Wales and maintained rail infrastructure within the New South Wales Metropolitan Rail Area.  From 2013, operation and maintenance functions were transferred to the new Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink agencies, leaving RailCorp as the legal owner of a portfolio of $28.6 billion of railway property, mostly within metropolitan area.  Other functions include network access, leasing and managing the NSW Government's contract with Airport Link Company.  The acting chief executive of RailCorp is Sydney Trains chief executive Howard Collins. The South Coast Line is an intercity rail service operated by NSW TrainLink that services the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia.  The service runs from , and runs the entire length of the eponymous South Coast railway line to .  The service also runs along the Eastern Suburbs railway line at peak hours and the Port Kembla railway line to .  It is operated with NSW TrainLink H sets and Sydney Trains T sets, with Endeavour railcars operating the service on the non-electrified line between and Bomaderry.

The NSW TrainLink Intercity Train Project is an initiative of Transport for New South Wales to procure 512 new carriages to replace NSW TrainLink's Intercity electric multiple unit fleet, freeing some trains for suburban use and the succeeding the entire V Set fleet.  The trains will operate on services from Sydney to Newcastle, Lithgow and Kiama.  The trains are expected to enter service between 2019 and 2022.   NSW TrainLink is a train and coach operator in Australia, providing services throughout New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, along with limited interstate services into Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. Its primary intercity and regional services are spread throughout five major rail lines, operating out of Sydney's Central railway station.NSW TrainLink was formed on 1 July 2013 when RailCorp was restructured and CountryLink was merged with the intercity services of CityRail.Between July 2013 and June 2024, NSW TrainLink was also responsible for the operation of intercity services. By this time, a process had been underway for their transfer to Sydney Trains. Intercity services were proposed to be transferred to Sydney Trains on 1 July 2024, making NSW TrainLink a regional-only transport provider. History In May 2012, the Minister for Transport announced a restructure of RailCorp. On 1 July 2013, NSW TrainLink took over (a) the operation of regional rail and coach services previously operated by CountryLink; (b) non-metropolitan Sydney services previously operated by CityRail; and (c) responsibility for the Main Northern railway line from Berowra railway station to Newcastle station, the Main Western railway line from Emu Plains railway station to Bathurst railway station, and the Illawarra railway line from Waterfall station to Bomaderry railway station.On 21 August 2023, a transition was announced for the operation of the Mariyung trains and the majority of intercity passenger services, crew and stations from NSW TrainLink to Sydney Trains. A process of transferring intercity services from NSW TrainLink to Sydney Trains began in 2023. From 1 July 2024, NSW Trainlink's Intercity services were proposed to be taken under the responsibility of Sydney Trains. This transfer was undertaken as part of Recommendation 12 of the Rail Review Plan. Network The NSW TrainLink network is divided into two tiers, branded as Intercity and Regional. Intercity services operate commuter style services, mainly to and from Sydney with limited stops within the metropolitan area. The Intercity network is part of Transport for NSW's Opal ticketing system. Seats on Intercity services are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Regional services operate in areas of lower population density, providing passenger transport mainly between regional NSW and Sydney (although some cross-country and interstate services operate). The NSW TrainLink H set or OSCAR (Outer Suburban CAR) is a class of electric multiple unit built by UGL Rail, Broadmeadow for CityRail in New South Wales, Australia.  They are operated by NSW TrainLink.  These sets operate services from Sydney to Hamilton (Newcastle), Springwood and Kiama.  The first entered service in December 2006 and the last in December 2012.  They are formed into 55 four-carriage sets. Kiama is an intercity train station located in Kiama, New South Wales, Australia, on the South Coast railway line.  The station serves NSW TrainLink diesel multiple unit trains travelling south to Bomaderry and electric multiple unit trains north to Wollongong and Sydney.  Premier Illawarra and Kiama Coaches operate connecting bus services to the surrounding towns of Gerroa, Jamberoo and Shellharbour.

He is best remembered for hosting the BBC's popular series \"The Generation Game\" and for his high camp and English music hall humour. Dawson's Creek is an American teen drama television series about the lives of a close-knit group of friends in the fictional town of Capeside, Massachusetts, beginning in high school and continuing into college that ran for six seasons from January 20, 1998, to May 14, 2003. The series starred James Van Der Beek as Dawson Leery; Katie Holmes as his best friend and love interest, Joey Potter; Joshua Jackson as their fellow friend Pacey Witter; and Michelle Williams as Jen Lindley, a New York City transplant to Capeside. The show was created by Kevin Williamson and premiered on The WB as a mid-season replacement. It was produced by Columbia TriStar Television (renamed Sony Pictures Television before the sixth and final season) and was filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina. The series ended on May 14, 2003. A total of 128 episodes were produced, spanning six seasons.Along with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and 7th Heaven, Dawson's Creek became one of the flagship shows for The WB and launched its main cast to international stardom. The show placed at No. 90 on Entertainment Weekly's \"New TV Classics\" list in 2007. It has also been credited with kicking off a boom of teen-centered shows in the late 1990s that continued into the 2000s. Premise Dawson Leery is an introspective 15-year-old and aspiring filmmaker in the small New England town of Capeside, Massachusetts. Since childhood, he has been best friends with Josephine \"Joey\" Potter, who routinely comes over to his house through a ladder into his bedroom for movie-watching and platonic sleepovers. Tomboy Joey, who lost her mother to cancer and whose father is in prison for drug trafficking, lives with her older sister Bessie, who runs the restaurant The Icehouse. Dawson works at a video rental store with his other best friend Pacey Witter, an underachieving class clown who occasionally squabbles with Joey. Dawson and Joey dance around a growing attraction to one another, but their dynamic shifts with the arrival of Jen Lindley, who has moved to Capeside from New York City to live with her grandparents. Michael Redmond (born October 1950) is an Irish stand-up comedian from Blackrock, Dublin, known for playing Father Stone in the \"Father Ted\" episode \"Entertaining Father Stone\".  He has a deadpan style of delivery and has been described as the \"possessor of comedy's most mournful moustache\". Leslie \"Les\" Dawson, Jr. (2 February 1931 – 10 June 1993) was an English comedian, actor, writer, and presenter, who is best remembered for his deadpan style, curmudgeonly persona and jokes about his mother-in-law and wife. Leslie Dawson (2 February 1931 – 10 June 1993) was an English comedian, actor, writer, presenter, and pianist.  He was known for his deadpan style, curmudgeonly persona, musical routines, and jokes about his mother-in-law and wife.    Early life  Les Dawson was born in Collyhurst, Manchester, on 2 February 1931, the only child of bricklayer Leslie Dawson (2 August 1905 - 10 April 1970) and Julia Nolan (14 January 1908 - 29 September 1957) who was of Irish descent. His first job was in the parcels department of the Manchester Co-op. He worked briefly as a journalist on the Bury Times.    Career  Early in life, Dawson wrote poetry and kept it secret. It was not expected that someone of his working class background would have literary ambitions. In a BBC Television documentary, he spoke of his love for canonical figures in English literature, in particular the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb, whose florid style influenced Dawson's. He did, moreover, appear with The Nelson Players in Nelson, Lancashire as Mr. Justice Wainwright and Carter, chief clerk to Sir Wilfrid Robarts Q.C. in Agatha Christie's play Witness for the Prosecution in December 1956. Dawson wrote in his autobiography that he had a job as a pianist in a Parisian brothel. Making a living as a pianist evolved into comedy when he got laughs from deliberately bad piano-playing by playing \"all the wrong notes in exactly the right order\" and complaining to the audience. He made his television debut on the talent show Opportunity Knocks in 1967 and worked as a comic on British television for the rest of his life. Television series in which he appeared included the panel game Jokers Wild (1969–73) hosted by Barry Cryer, Sez Les (1969–76) and Dawson's Weekly (1975), all for Yorkshire Television. After joining the BBC, his TV projects were The Dawson Watch (1979–80), written by Andy Hamilton and Terry Ravenscroft, The Les Dawson Show (1978–89), written by Terry Ravenscroft, and the quiz show Blankety Blank, which he presented from 1984 until its cancellation in 1990.

The show starred comedian Les Dawson (1931–1993), who had previously starred in the ITV sketch comedy programme Sez Les (1969–76), followed by Dawson and Friends (1977). The Les Dawson Show also featured sketch comedy, as well as stand-up comedy, guest appearances, dance numbers, and musical performances. Overview  Series 1–2 In the first series, transmitted in 1978, Dawson co-hosted the show with Scottish singer-songwriter Lulu. In addition to comedy sketches and songs by Dawson, Lulu, and guests artists, each episode featured performances by the Dougie Squires Dancers, with choreography by Dougie Squires. The musical director at this time was John Coleman, and the arranger was Alan Roper. Episodes of this first series aired fortnightly rather than weekly.No new episodes of the show aired for more than three years. Then, in May 1981, BBC1 transmitted a bank holiday special that reunited Dawson with his longtime comedy compatriot Roy Barraclough, and Sez Les writer Terry Ravenscroft. It also replaced the Dougie Squires Dancers with Kids International, a multi-ethnic singing and dancing group assembled by the show's producer, Ernest Maxin. Maxin, Barraclough, and Kids International stayed with the show through its second series—which premiered eight months later, in January 1982. For series two, Alyn Ainsworth joined-on as bandleader, and musical arrangements were handled by some new contributors to the programme, including Ivor Raymonde and Max Harris. Roy Barraclough wrote and/or performed.Later that year, Kids International got their own 30-minute Christmas special. The Kids International Show aired on 24 December 1982; Maxin produced and directed, while Alyn Ainsworth and orchestra provided music. Series 3–4 For the third series, which aired in 1983, Maxin remained as producer, but Ronnie Hazlehurst became the show's musical director, and comedian Eli Woods joined the cast. Kids International, however, were becoming so popular there was a threat that they would upstage Dawson. One World is a half-hour comedy series that aired on the TNBC block from 1998 to 2001.

        "question": "Who is an American singer, songwriter, actress and LGBT rights activist who released a 1985 song  for the film \"The Goonies\"?",
        "answer": "Cynthia Ann Stephanie \"Cyndi\" Lauper",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Who is an American singer, songwriter, actress and LGBT rights activist who released a 1985 song  for the film \"The Goonies\"?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\n\"True Colors\" is a number one hit song written by American songwriters Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. It was both the title track and the first single released from American singer Cyndi Lauper's second studio album of the same name (1986). Released in mid-1986, the song spent two weeks at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, being Lauper's second and last single to occupy the top of the chart. It received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Composition Billy Steinberg originally wrote \"True Colors\" about his own mother. Tom Kelly altered the first verse and the duo originally submitted the song to Anne Murray, who passed on recording it, and then to Cyndi Lauper. Their demo was in the form of a piano-based gospel ballad like \"Bridge over Troubled Water\".  Steinberg told Songfacts that \"Cyndi completely dismantled that sort of traditional arrangement and came up with something that was breathtaking and stark.\" Other songs they wrote for Lauper include \"I Drove All Night\" and \"Unconditional Love\". Music video The accompanying music video for the song, which received heavy rotation on MTV, was directed by American choreographer Patricia Birch. In the video, Lauper sings on a dark soundstage, sitting beside a drum and holding a black flower. A young girl who explores a beach takes the flower and ends up seeing two women, one light-skinned and one dark-skinned, drinking tea on a boat. Lauper appears on the beach in an elaborate jeweled headdress with a shell in her hand. She is then seen lying on a white sheet, which a long haired man (David Wolff) proceeds to pull. They eventually share a kiss. Lauper is then seen walking on the beach with a skirt made of newspaper while she walks past a class of schoolchildren. At the end of the video, she leans over a pool of water, in a scene reminiscent of the album photo cover. The video ends as it began, only now, Lauper is beating on the drum four times, in time with the music. Critical reception Jerry Smith of the Music Week magazine deemed that \"Lauper's fragile little girl voice\" perfectly matches with this \"effective ballad with its sympathetic, sparse accompaniment\", but also added that this \"downbeat style\" was unlikely to make the song memorable.

Lauper played the song throughout her True Colors World Tour, but refused to play the song from 1987 onwards until pressure from fans finally made her add the song back into her set list, beginning with her True Colors Tour in 2007 and 2008.  \"Eight Arms to Hold You\" by Goon Squad, was released as the second single from the album and reached number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1985.

Amber Laura Heard was a trial held in Fairfax County, Virginia, from April 11 to June 1, 2022, that ruled on allegations of defamation between formerly married American actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Depp, as plaintiff, filed a complaint of defamation against defendant Heard claiming $50 million in damages; Heard filed counterclaims against Depp claiming $100 million in damages.Depp and Heard first met in 2009, and got married in February 2015. In May 2016, at an early stage in their divorce proceedings, Heard claimed that Depp had abused her physically, which he denied. In a separate libel trial in England, in which Depp sued News Group Newspapers Ltd over an article published in The Sun, the presiding judge ruled against Depp, stating, \"[T]he great majority of alleged assaults of Ms. Heard by Mr. Depp have been proved to the civil standard.\" Several legal experts suggested that Depp had a smaller chance of winning in the US trial compared to the UK trial.In the Virginia trial, Depp's claims related to a December 2018 op-ed by Heard, published in The Washington Post. Depp claimed Heard caused new damage to his reputation and career by stating that she had spoken up against \"sexual violence\" and \"faced our culture's wrath\"; that \"two years ago, [she] became a public figure representing domestic abuse\" and \"felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out\"; and that she \"had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse\". Heard's counterclaims included allegations that Adam Waldman, Depp's former lawyer, had defamed her in statements published in the Daily Mail in 2020. Throughout the trial, Depp's legal team sought to disprove Heard's domestic abuse allegations and to demonstrate that she had been the instigator, rather than the victim, of intimate partner violence. Heard's lawyers defended the op-ed, claiming it to be factual and protected by the First Amendment.The jury ruled that Heard's op-ed references to \"sexual violence\" and \"domestic abuse\" were false and defamed Depp with actual malice and awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages from Heard, although the court reduced the punitive damages to $350,000 due to a limit imposed by Virginia state law. Tasya van Ree (born April 30, 1976) is an American painter and photographer. She is noted for her work in photography and for her multifaceted interests in mixed media and visual presentation, particularly in fashion and its relation to identity, as well as for dating actress Amber Heard. Early life and education Van Ree is of Japanese-Dutch descent. She was raised in Mililani, Hawaii and was a surfer. She took a photography course in high school and became serious about the craft in her senior year. In 1994, van Ree moved to Los Angeles to attend college, but she eventually dropped out. Career Van Ree is predominantly known for her black-and-white photographs of celebrities, including Michelle Rodriguez, Katherine Moennig and Matt Dallas. She has said that black and white photography \"contains a certain presence; it takes the subject matter and ignites a certain lyrical quality within it that one cannot express in words.\" Van Ree's use of the medium is particularly concerned with the way that the black and white image conveys a sense of time and timelessness, and that the contrast of her modern subjects with the temporal associations of the medium is a source of the intriguing qualities of her photographs. In several interviews, she referred to actress Amber Heard as her main muse: \"Gala is to Salvador Dali, Kiki de Montparnasse is to Man Ray, Beatrice is to Dante Alighieri.\"In the 2014 exhibit A State of Mind & Affairs of its Games, van Ree displayed a contrast in both subject matter and medium for her photography. The photos exhibited portrayed toys and popular objects, and were printed in full color.Her work has been exhibited in several cities and magazines. She has been exhibited both as a solo photographer and with other notable artists, including Gus Van Sant, Amy Arbus, David Lynch, and Jessica Lange. Her work is also featured in private collections.In addition to photography, van Ree makes short films and works in other visual media, including painting and pencil drawings. In her drawings, she finds inspiration in her dreams, and has undertaken drawing as an attempt to give the images of her dreams tangibility. This dream-drawing, according to van Ree, also creates a sense of familiarity with her waking life. She also has designed text-based T-shirts, which she calls \"DieWilder\" and wears herself in public appearances.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

The school, which serves grades 9-12, is a part of the Baldwin County Public Schools district.  Students at the school live in the city of Daphne and its surrounding unincorporated areas and the city of Loxley.  Daphne High School's mascot is the Trojan. Leoš Janáček (Czech pronunciation: [ˈlɛoʃ ˈjanaːtʃɛk] , 3 July 1854 – 12 August 1928) was a Czech composer, music theorist, folklorist, publicist, and teacher. He was inspired by Moravian and other Slavic music, including Eastern European folk music, to create an original, modern musical style.Born in Hukvaldy, Janáček demonstrated musical talent at an early age and was educated in Brno, Prague, Leipzig, and Vienna. He then returned to live in Brno, where he married his pupil Zdenka Schulzová and devoted himself mainly to folkloristic research. His earlier musical output was influenced by contemporaries such as Antonín Dvořák, but around the turn of the century he began to incorporate his earlier studies of national folk music, as well as his transcriptions of \"speech melodies\" of spoken language, to create a modern, highly original synthesis. The death of his daughter Olga in 1903 had a profound effect on his musical output; these notable transformations were first evident in the opera Jenůfa (often called the \"Moravian national opera\"), which premiered in 1904 in Brno.In the following years, Janáček became frustrated with a lack of recognition from Prague, but this was finally relieved by the success of a revised edition of Jenůfa at the National Theatre in 1916, which gave Janáček access to the world's great opera stages. Janáček's later works are his most celebrated. They include operas such as Káťa Kabanová and The Cunning Little Vixen, the Sinfonietta, the Glagolitic Mass, the rhapsody Taras Bulba, two string quartets, and other chamber works. Many of Janáček's later works were influenced by Czech and Russian literature, his pan-Slavist sentiments, and his infatuation with Kamila Stösslová.After his death in 1928, Janáček's work was heavily promoted on the world opera stage by the Australian conductor Charles Mackerras, who also restored some of his compositions to their original, unrevised forms. In his homeland he inspired a new generation of Czech composers including several of his students. Eve Queler (born January 11, 1931) is an American conductor and the \"emerita\" Artistic Director of the Opera Orchestra of New York (OONY).  She founded the OONY in 1971, after having worked on the staff of the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera.  She is notable for her advocacy for, and conducting of, lesser known and less-frequently performed operas, such as \"Rienzi\" and \"Jenůfa\". Christmas operas are operas which are thematically based on either the Nativity of Jesus or secular Christmas stories.  The earliest Christmas operas appeared in the early 17th century, not long after the creation of the art form.  Because of the ban on secular theatrical works during the season of Advent, these early Christmas operas, while elaborately staged, were based on religious themes relating to the Nativity.  By the mid 19th century the ban on secular operas during Advent had ceased, and operas based on a wider array of Christmas themes, such as Santa Claus and King Wenceslaus, emerged.  Several operas have been inspired by Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\", including works by composers Bernard Herrmann and Thea Musgrave.  The story of the Magi has also been the basis of several operas, including Gian Carlo Menotti's 1951 opera \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\".  Initially written for television performance, Menotti's opera has become the only modern Christmas opera to earn an enduring place in the live opera performance repertoire.  In the 21st century, composer Kevin Puts' \"Silent Night\" (2011) achieved critical success and won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 2012. The Czech Republic, also known as Czechia, is a landlocked country in Central Europe. Historically known as Bohemia, it is bordered by Austria to the south, Germany to the west, Poland to the northeast, and Slovakia to the southeast. The Czech Republic has a hilly landscape that covers an area of 78,871 square kilometers (30,452 sq mi) with a mostly temperate continental and oceanic climate. The capital and largest city is Prague; other major cities and urban areas include Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň and Liberec.The Duchy of Bohemia was founded in the late 9th century under Great Moravia. It was formally recognized as an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire in 1002 and became a kingdom in 1198. Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, all of the Crown lands of Bohemia were gradually integrated into the Habsburg monarchy. Nearly a hundred years later, the Protestant Bohemian Revolt led to the Thirty Years' War. After the Battle of White Mountain, the Habsburgs consolidated their rule. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Crown lands became part of the Austrian Empire.In the 19th century, the Czech lands became more industrialized, and in 1918 most of it became part of the First Czechoslovak Republic following the collapse of Austria-Hungary after World War I. Czechoslovakia was the only country in Central and Eastern Europe to remain a parliamentary democracy during the entirety of the interwar period. After the Munich Agreement in 1938, Nazi Germany systematically took control over the Czech lands. Czechoslovakia was restored in 1945 and three years later became an Eastern Bloc communist state following a coup d'état in 1948. Attempts to liberalize the government and economy were suppressed by a Soviet-led invasion of the country during the Prague Spring in 1968. In November 1989, the Velvet Revolution ended communist rule in the country and restored democracy. On 31 December 1992, Czechoslovakia was peacefully dissolved, with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.The Czech Republic is a unitary parliamentary republic and developed country with an advanced, high-income social market economy. It is a welfare state with a European social model, universal health care and free-tuition university education. It ranks 32nd in the Human Development Index. Daphne laureola, commonly called spurge-laurel (or daphne-laurel, laurel-leaved daphne, olive-spurge, wood laurel, copse laurel), is a shrub in the flowering plant family Thymelaeaceae.  Despite the name, this woodland plant is neither a spurge nor a laurel.  Its native range covers much of Europe and extends to Algeria, Morocco and the Azores.  With \"Daphne mezereum\" it is one of two species of \"Daphne\" native to Britain, both of which have a strong preference for alkaline soils and are most commonly found in limestone areas, although \"D. laureola\" is also found on clay.  However, unlike \"D. mezereum\", \"D. laureola\" is an evergreen with yellowish green flowers borne very early in the spring and black berries, which are poisonous to humans but not to birds, present from late summer.  All parts of the plants are poisonous.  The sap is known to cause skin rashes on contact. Daphne Ann Blake is a fictional character in the long-running American animated series \"Scooby-Doo\".  Daphne, depicted as coming from a wealthy family, is noted for her red hair, lavender heels, fashion sense, and her knack for getting into danger, hence the nickname \"Danger Prone Daphne\".  Daphne has appeared in more adaptations than the other characters, aside from Shaggy Rogers and Scooby-Doo. Daphne ( ; Greek: Δάφνη , meaning \"laurel\") is a minor figure in Greek mythology known as a naiad—a type of female nymph associated with fountains, wells, springs, streams, brooks and other bodies of freshwater.  There are several versions of the myth, but the general narrative is that because of her beauty, Daphne attracted the attention and ardor of the god Apollo (Phoebus).  Apollo pursued her and just before being overtaken, Daphne pleaded to her father, the rivergod Ladon, and Ge (Gaia) for help.  So Ladon then transformed Daphne into a laurel tree.  In \"Metamorphoses\" by Roman poet Ovid, she is identified as the daughter of the rivergod Pineios in Thessaly.  At the Pythian Games which were held every four years in Delphi in honour of Apollo, a wreath of laurel gathered from the Vale of Tempe in Thessaly was given as a prize.  According to Pausanias the reason for this was \"simply and solely because the prevailing tradition has it that Apollo fell in love with the daughter of Ladon (Daphne)\". Daphne (; DAFF-nee; Greek: Δάφνη, Dáphnē, lit. 'laurel'), a figure in Greek mythology, is a naiad, a variety of female nymph associated with fountains, wells, springs, streams, brooks and other bodies of freshwater.There are several versions of the myth in which she appears, but the general narrative, found in Greco-Roman mythology, is that due to a curse made by the fierce wrath of the god Cupid, son of Venus, on the god Apollo (Phoebus), she became the unwilling object of the infatuation of Apollo, who chased her against her wishes. Just before being kissed by him, Daphne invoked her river god father, who transformed her into a laurel tree, thus foiling Apollo.Thenceforth Apollo developed a special reverence for laurel. At the Pythian Games, which were held every four years in Delphi in honour of Apollo, a wreath of laurel gathered from the Vale of Tempe in Thessaly was given as a prize. Hence it later became customary to award prizes in the form of laurel wreaths to victorious generals, athletes, poets and musicians, worn as a chaplet on the head. The Poet Laureate is a well-known modern example of such a prize-winner, dating from the early Renaissance in Italy. According to Pausanias the reason for this was \"simply and solely because the prevailing tradition has it that Apollo fell in love with the daughter of Ladon (Daphne)\". Most artistic depictions of the myth focus on the moment of Daphne's transformation. Family Daphne is said by ancient sources variously to have been a daughter of the (1) Thessalian river god Peneus by the nymph Creusa, or of (2) another Arcadian river-deity Ladon (Orontes) by Ge (Earth) and Stymphalis, or lastly, King Amyclas of Amyclae. Mythology The earliest source of the myth of Daphne and Apollo is Phylarchus, quoted by Parthenius of Nicaea. Jenůfa    (Její pastorkyňa, \"Her Stepdaughter\" in Czech) is an opera in three acts by Leoš Janáček to a Czech libretto by the composer, based on the play \"Její pastorkyňa\" by Gabriela Preissová.  It was first performed at the Brno Theater, Brno, 21 January 1904.  It was written between 1896 and 1902, and counts among the first operas written in prose.

The first of Janáček's operas in which his distinctive voice can clearly be heard, it is a grim story of infanticide and redemption. Like the playwright's original work, it is known for its unsentimental realism. While today it is heard in the composer's original version, Jenůfa's early popularity was due to a revised version by Karel Kovařovic, altering what was considered its eccentric style and orchestration. Thus altered, it was well-received, first in Prague, and particularly after its Vienna première also worldwide. More than 70 years passed before audiences again heard it in Janáček's original version. Janáček wrote an overture to the opera, but decided not to use it. It was partly based on a song called Žárlivec (The jealous man). It is now performed as a concert piece under the title Žárlivost (Jealousy), JW 6/10. The composer dedicated the work to the memory of his daughter Olga (d. 1903), as he did his choral composition the Elegy on the Death of Daughter Olga.

Before the opera begins, the mill-owner Grandmother Buryja had two sons. The elder married the widow of a man named Klemeň, became stepfather to her son Laca, and had a son of his own with her, Števa. The younger married twice, and had a daughter, Jenůfa, with his first wife. When the opera opens, Grandmother Buryja's sons and their wives have died, except for the Kostelnička (the sacristan or sextoness of the village church), the younger son's second wife and Jenůfa's stepmother.

Forty years after its release, Time magazine rated it as one of the 100 all-time great films. In 1997, British critic Leslie Halliwell described it as a \"comic fantasia with music; an enormous commercial success with the director trying every cinematic gag in the book\" and awarded it a full four stars. The film is credited as being one of the most influential of all musical films, inspiring the Monkees' television show and pop music videos, and various other low-budget musical film vehicles starring British pop groups, such as the Gerry and the Pacemakers film Ferry Cross the Mersey.In 1999, the British Film Institute ranked it the 88th-greatest British film of the 20th century. Plot The four Beatles evade a horde of fans while boarding a train for London to film a televised variety show concert. En route, they meet Paul McCartney's trouble-making Irish grandfather John. The band entertains some schoolgirls and plays cards with their manager Norm and road manager Shake before arriving in London. They are quickly driven from the station to a hotel and begin to feel confined. Norm brings each Beatle a pile of fan mail and tasks them with answering each letter, but they sneak out to party. Norm and Shake catch them and order them back to the room, where they find out that Paul's grandfather has gone to a gambling club using an invitation sent to Ringo; they track him down and bring him back to the hotel.The next day, the Beatles arrive at a TV studio for rehearsals. The television producer assumes bad faith in them due to something Paul's grandfather said. After a mundane cocktail reception where the group tease reporters with comic and evasive answers to interview questions, they leave through a fire escape and cavort in a field until forced off by its caretaker. Back in the studio, they are separated when a woman thinks she recognizes John Lennon but cannot recall who he is.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: The Cirrus SR22 aircraft was built by a company founded in what year?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe Hindustan HT-2 is an Indian two-seat primary trainer designed and built by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.  The HT-2 was the first company design to enter production in 1953 for the Indian Air Force and Navy, where it replaced the de Havilland Tiger Moth.  The HT-2 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a fixed tailwheel landing gear.  Powered by a 155 hp (116 kW) Cirrus Major III piston engine the aircraft has enclosed tandem cockpits with dual controls.  Apart from military use the aircraft was also used by Indian flying schools. The Cirrus Aircraft Corporation (formally Cirrus Design Corporation) is an aircraft manufacturer that was founded in 1984 by Alan and Dale Klapmeier to produce the VK-30 kit aircraft.  The company headquarters is located in Duluth, Minnesota, United States.  As of June 2015, Cirrus had delivered over 6,000 aircraft in 16 years of production, and has been the world's largest producer of piston-powered aircraft since 2013. The Cirrus Design Corporation, doing business as Cirrus Aircraft (formally Cirrus Design), is an aircraft manufacturer that was founded in 1984 by Alan and Dale Klapmeier to produce the VK-30 kit aircraft, and is headquartered in Duluth, Minnesota, United States. The company is majority owned by a subsidiary of the Chinese government-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), with operational locations in seven states across the US including Minnesota, North Dakota, Tennessee (where its customer headquarters are based), Texas, Arizona, Florida and Michigan, as well as additional sales locations in France and the Netherlands. Cirrus markets several versions of its three certificated single-engine light aircraft models: the SR20 (certified in 1998), SR22 (certified in 2000), and SR22T (certified in 2010). As of April 2023, the company had delivered more than 9,000 SR-aircraft in over 20 years of production, and has been the world's largest producer of piston-powered aircraft since 2013. Sales of the SR-series grew rapidly during the 2000s, until the economic crisis of 2008. Cirrus was planning to market a light-sport aircraft called the SR Sport, but suspended the project in 2009, due to financial challenges and a lack of market demand. This has since been cancelled. After a return to company growth and United States-based expansion in the 2010s, Cirrus certified and began deliveries of the Vision SF50 very light jet in 2016. Upon its delivery, the aircraft became the first civilian single-engined jet to enter the market, and is often referred to as a \"personal jet\". The company produces all of its aircraft with composite materials and is known for pioneering new technologies in the light general aviation aircraft manufacturing industry, including glass cockpits and full-airframe ballistic parachutes. In 2001, Cirrus sold a majority of the company to Bahrain-based Arcapita. Ten years later, the manufacturer was acquired by China Aviation Industry General Aircraft (CAIGA), which is a division of the state-owned AVIC.

Ten years later, the manufacturer was acquired by China Aviation Industry General Aircraft (CAIGA), which is a division of the Chinese state-owned AVIC. In 2024, it became a minority publicly-owned company as a component of the SEHK. The Cirrus Vision SF50, also known as the Vision Jet, is a single-engine very light jet designed and produced by Cirrus Aircraft of Duluth, Minnesota, United States.After receiving deposits starting in 2006, Cirrus unveiled an aircraft mock-up on 28 June 2007 and a prototype on 26 June 2008. It made its maiden flight on 3 July 2008. Development slowed in 2009 due to lack of funding. In 2011, Cirrus was bought by CAIGA, a Chinese enterprise that funded the project a year later. The first conforming prototype subsequently flew on 24 March 2014, followed by two other prototypes that same year. The test flying program resulted in the US Federal Aviation Administration awarding a type certificate on 28 October 2016. Deliveries started on 19 December 2016, and by July 2020, 200 jets had been delivered. From 2018 through 2023, it has been the most-delivered business jet.Powered by a Williams FJ33 turbofan, the all-carbon fiber, low-wing, seven-seat Vision SF50 is pressurized, cruises at 300 knots (560 km/h; 350 mph) and has a range of over 1,200 nautical miles (2,200 km; 1,400 mi). For emergency uses, it has both a whole-airframe ballistic parachute and autoland system.Reviews have compared its performance to high-performance single-turboprop aircraft. In 2018, the Vision Jet was awarded the Collier Trophy for the \"greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics in America\" during the preceding year, being the first certified single-engine civilian jet. Development  Naming From June 2006 to July 2008, the design was developed under the project name \"The Jet\", or \"The-Jet by Cirrus\". On 9 July 2008, Cirrus announced the marketing name of \"Vision SJ50\", with \"V\" for the V-tail and \"SJ\" for \"single-jet\". Avidyne Entegra is an integrated aircraft instrumentation system, produced by Avidyne Corporation, consisting of a primary flight display (PFD), and multi-function display (MFD).  Cirrus became the first customer of the Entegra system and began offering it on the SR20 and SR22 aircraft in 2003 as the first integrated flight deck for light general aviation (GA).  The original Entegra system was designed to use third-party components such as a GPS from Garmin and an autopilot system from S-TEC Corporation. The Folkerts SK-1,Speed King One, Mono Special, Matilda, Fordon-Neumann Special, Hardwick-Whittenbeck Special was a racer built for the 1930 American Cirrus Aircraft Engine Company sponsored American Cirrus Derby. Ampyx Power is an airborne wind energy company founded in 2008 by Bas Lansdorp and Richard Ruiterkamp.  It was created after Lansdorp dropped his five-year-long studies of wind energy at Delft University of Technology to found Ampyx Power.  In 2011, Lansdorp sold a majority of his Ampyx Power shares to fund his new project, Mars One.  Wubbo Ockels' interest in energy began when he let a kite line slip and it burned his hand.  He became interested and started to study and research how this could be turned into electricity.  At Delft University, he formed a team with Bas Lansdorp that worked on developing kites that could retrieve energy from the sky.  Richard Ruiterkamp became the team leader and he created a fixed wing aircraft that allowed greater controllability and allowing the generation of more energy.  In 2008 he founded the company with Bas Lansdorp.  Lansdorp worked on the business aspect, and Ruiterkamp was head of the science division.  Currently, Ampyx Power has a team of 40 engineers.  Their current prototype is the AP3 Ampyx Power Airborne Wind Energy System (AWES).  The system is a tethered aircraft that converts wind into electric energy.  The aircraft is tethered to an on the ground generator.  When the aircraft moves and flies, it reels the tether and powers the generator.  The plane is then reeled in through the tether and then re-released into the air. Western Boat Building Co was a company based in Tacoma, Washington from 1916 till 1982.  The company was founded by Martin Petrich, Joe M. Martinac and William Vickart.  Within a few years, Joe Martinac left the partnership to go to the Tacoma Shipbuilding Company, and later started his own company.  William Vickart was killed in an accident in 1921, leaving Martin Petrich the sole owner.  In the early 1920s the company was located at the foot of Starr Street on part of the former Tacoma Mill Company property after that property was destroyed in a fire.  Later yards were located on East 11th Street, D Street, and Marine View Drive.  In 1937, the company built the Western Flyer as a purse seiner, and in 1940, this boat was the vehicle that carried John Steinbeck on the journey which he documented in The Log from the Sea of Cortez.  In 1949, the company launched the largest tuna clipper ever built till that time, the 150 foot Mary E. Petrich.  Towards the end of World War II, the company founded the Fairliner division which made fast speed boats.  Before the devastating yard fire of 1950, the company was the largest builder of wooden pleasure boats on the west coast.  The company continued to build boats till 1982. The Cirrus SR20 is an American piston-engined, four- or five-seat composite monoplane built since 1999 by Cirrus Aircraft of Duluth, Minnesota. The aircraft is the company's earliest type-certified model, earning certification in 1998.It was the first production general aviation (GA) aircraft equipped with a parachute to lower the airplane safely to the ground after a loss of control, structural failure, or midair collision. The SR series was also the first mass-manufactured light aircraft with all-composite construction and flat-panel avionics.The SR20 was developed into the Cirrus SR22, which was introduced in 2001 and is the most-produced GA aircraft of the 21st century. Design and development The SR20 mock-up was unveiled in 1994. The aircraft first flew on 21 March 1995 and FAA certification was achieved on 23 October 1998. At the time of the airplane's release, the GA industry was struggling; the SR20 was one of the first of its kind to earn FAA Part 23 certification in several years. Over a thousand SR20s have been sold since deliveries began in July 1999. From 1999 to 2015, more than 6,000 SR-series aircraft had been delivered, something that no other aviation company had accomplished for the last half-century.One of the major selling points for the SR20 is its Garmin Cirrus Perspective avionics suite with dual 10-inch (250 mm) or 12-inch (300 mm) screens: one primary flight display (PFD) and one multifunction display (MFD), first introduced by the company in May 2008. This provides all standard communication, navigation (GPS and conventional VHF), and surveillance (Mode S transponder) functions. Other avionics features include in-flight weather information and TCAS-like traffic information.SR20s made from 1999 to 2003 were equipped with traditional analog instruments and a 10\" MFD. The Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) is a whole-plane ballistic parachute recovery system designed specifically for Cirrus Aircraft's line of general aviation light aircraft including the SR20, SR22 and SF50.  The design became the first of its kind to become certified with the FAA, achieving certification in October 1998, and remains the only aircraft ballistic parachute used as standard equipment by an aviation company.

A Republican, he was later appointed as FBI director by President Bill Clinton. He is now a lawyer and consultant in the private sector. Early life and career Freeh was born January 6, 1950, in Jersey City, New Jersey, the son of Italian-American parents Bernice (née Chinchiolo), a former bookkeeper, and William Freeh Sr., a real estate broker. Freeh, a native of North Bergen, graduated from Saint Joseph of the Palisades High School in West New York, New Jersey in 1967, where he was taught by Christian Brothers. He then graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Rutgers University–New Brunswick with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1971, and received a Juris Doctor degree from Rutgers School of Law–Newark in 1974 and a Master of Laws degree in criminal law from New York University School of Law in 1984. Freeh was an FBI Special Agent from 1975 to 1981 in the New York City field office and at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. In 1981, he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York as an Assistant United States Attorney. Subsequently, he held positions there as Chief of the Organized Crime Unit, Deputy United States Attorney, and Associate United States Attorney. He was also a first lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve.As a youth, Freeh became an Eagle Scout in 1963 and in 1995 was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the Boy Scouts of America. \"Pizza Connection\" case A notable case Freeh was associated with was the \"Pizza Connection\" investigation, in which he was lead prosecutor. The case, prosecuted in the mid-1980s, involved a drug trafficking operation in the United States by Sicilian organized crime members who used pizza parlors as fronts. After a 16-month trial, 17 of 19 defendants were convicted, of which 16 were sentenced. The Montana Freemen were an anti-government Christian Patriot movement group based outside the town of Jordan, Montana.  The members of the group referred to their land as \"Justus Township\" and had declared themselves no longer under the authority of any outside government.  They became the center of public attention in 1996 when they engaged in a prolonged armed standoff with agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

They became the center of public attention in 1996 when they engaged in a prolonged armed standoff with agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).    Ideology   The Montana Freemen, who were direct ideological descendants of the Posse Comitatus movement, espoused the doctrine of individual sovereignty and based on this belief, they rejected the authority of the federal government of the United States. On March 2, 1995, William Stanton, a Garfield County rancher, became the first Montana resident ever to be convicted of terrorism; District Judge Kenneth Wilson sentenced Stanton to 10 years in prison (the maximum penalty) for using violence for political ends. The following day, four armed men who styled themselves the \"Garfield County Freemen\" were arrested when they entered the Musselshell County Courthouse and tried to file papers protesting the seizure of Rodney Skurdal's house by the Internal Revenue Service.    Liens  The Freemen, led by LeRoy M. Schweitzer, used inter alia Anderson on the Uniform Commercial Code and Bankers Handbook to draw notices of lien against public officials. The liens were then allegedly sold to generate equity to fund an effort to make a \"firm offer to pay off the national debt.\" The Freemen claimed that the liens conformed to the Uniform Commercial Code and that their township's court had an interest in a tort claim for damages incurred by the named public officials for violations of their oaths of office. They also claimed that support of the corporate credit system was an unconstitutional and corrupt act which has throughout the last half of the twentieth century \"...[deprived the majority of Americans] of their property until [their] posterity wakes up homeless...\", a paraphrased quotation attributed to Thomas Jefferson.    Bank fraud  The Freemen were known to produce their own very realistic counterfeit checks and money orders, sometimes ordering items and deliberately overpaying so they could demand refunds. The president of one bank reported that over an 18-month period his bank received two to five complaints a week about Freemen checks.

It functions as a full-service law enforcement agency with responsibilities and jurisdiction in those National Park Service areas primarily located in the Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and New York City areas and certain other government lands.  The United States Park Police is one of the few full-service police departments in the federal government that possess both state and federal authority.  In addition to performing the normal crime prevention, investigation, and apprehension functions of an urban police force, the Park Police are responsible for policing many of the famous monuments in the United States.  The USPP shares law enforcement jurisdiction in all lands administered by the National Park Service with a force of National Park Service Rangers tasked with the same law enforcement powers and responsibilities.  The agency also provides protection for the President, Secretary of the Interior, and visiting dignitaries.  The Park Police is a unit of the National Park Service, which is a bureau of the Department of the Interior. How the Millennium Comes Violently: From Jonestown to Heaven's Gate is a book about millennialist violence by Catherine Wessinger, published in 2000 by Seven Bridges Press. The book covers various millennialist new religious movements (NRMs) and their relation to violence, including the Peoples Temple, the Branch Davidians, Aum Shinrikyo, the Order of the Solar Temple, and Heaven's Gate, and attempts to set out a typology for dealing with millennial NRMs. Critical reception was largely positive, with many reviewers describing it as one of the best books about the topic, though the specifics of some of her analytical methods were criticized, as was the chapter on the Branch Davidians. Background Catherine Wessinger is a scholar of new religious movements. The book was written in the aftermath of both the Waco siege in 1993 and the Aum Shinrikyo Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995. In the aftermath of the Waco siege, there had been increased concern among NRM researchers about the official responses and \"cult stereotyping\" worsening the situation in dealing with NRMs. After the aftermath of the sarin attack, there was a shift to concern over the internally caused sources of violence in some groups and their leaders.At the time of the Waco standoff, Wessinger was chair of the New Religious Movements Group of the American Academy of Religion. At the time she had believed the news reports about the unfolding situation, but after the siege ended in the deaths of over 70 people she became compelled to research herself. She later became an activist by 1997. Contents The book covers various millennialist NRMs and their relation to violence. There are nine chapters in total, six of which focus on specific groups. The book's chapters each cover Peoples Temple, the Branch Davidians, Aum Shinrikyo, the Montana Freemen (a group in which violence was averted) a chapter split between the Order of the Solar Temple and Heaven's Gate (as \"Other Cases Briefly Considered\"), and a chapter covering the Chen Tao (a non-violent group).A foreword is given by Jayne Seminare Docherty, and an introduction chapter sets out Wessinger's background and her opinion on the \"cult\" moniker, which she views as a pejorative. Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing.  While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and \"property\" such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime.  To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity.  Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.  In 2015, Eric Holder ended 'adoptive forfeiture' which occurred \"when a state or local law enforcement agency seizes property pursuant to state law and requests that a federal agency take the seized asset and forfeit it under federal law\" due to abuse.  States proceeded to curtail the powers of police to seize assets, actions by the justice department in July 2017 have sought to reinstate police seizure powers to raise funding for federal agencies and local law enforcement. Air and Marine Operations (AMO) is a federal law enforcement agency within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  AMO is the world's largest civilian aviation and maritime law enforcement organization.  Its mission is to protect the American people and nation’s critical infrastructure through the coordinated use of air and marine assets to detect, interdict and prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs, and other contraband toward or across the borders of the United States.  Air and Marine Operations Agents and Officers are endowed with the authority to enforce Title 8 (Aliens and Nationality) and Title 19 (Customs) of the United States Code in addition to the general law enforcement powers bestowed upon federal law enforcement agents. The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin has been published monthly since 1932 by the FBI \"Law Enforcement Communication Unit\", with articles of interest to state and local law enforcement personnel.  First published in 1932 as Fugitives Wanted by Police, the \"FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin\" covers topics including law enforcement technology and issues, such as crime mapping and use of force, as well as recent criminal justice research, and VICAP alerts, on wanted suspects and key cases. The Public Universal Friend (born Jemima Wilkinson; November 29, 1752 – July 1, 1819) was an American preacher born in Cumberland, Rhode Island, to Quaker parents. After suffering a severe illness in 1776, the Friend claimed to have died and been reanimated as a genderless evangelist named the Public Universal Friend, and afterward shunned both birth name and gendered pronouns. In androgynous clothes, the Friend preached throughout the northeastern United States, attracting many followers who became the Society of Universal Friends.The Friend's theology was broadly similar to that of most Quakers. The Friend stressed free will, opposed slavery, and supported sexual abstinence. The most committed members of the Society of Universal Friends were a group of unmarried women who took leading roles in their households and community. In the 1790s, members of the Society acquired land in Western New York where they formed the town of Jerusalem near Penn Yan, New York. The Society of Universal Friends ceased to exist by the 1860s. Many writers have portrayed the Friend as a woman, and either a manipulative fraudster, or a pioneer for women's rights; others have viewed the Friend as transgender or non-binary and a figure in trans history. Early life Wilkinson, who would later become the Public Universal Friend, was born on November 29, 1752, in Cumberland, Rhode Island, as the eighth child of Amy (or Amey, née Whipple) and Jeremiah Wilkinson,: 11–12  becoming the fourth generation of the family to live in America. The child was given the name Jemima after Jemima, one of the biblical Job's daughters. Wilkinson's great-grandfather, Lawrence Wilkinson, was an officer in the army of Charles I who had emigrated from England around 1650 and was active in colonial government. Jeremiah Wilkinson was a cousin of Stephen Hopkins, the colony's longtime governor and signer of the Declaration of Independence. Jeremiah attended traditional worship with the Society of Friends (the Quakers) at the Smithfield Meeting House. Early biographer David Hudson says that Amy was also a member of the Society for many years,: 9  while later biographer Herbert Wisbey finds no evidence of that, but quotes Moses Brown as saying the child was \"born such\" because of Jeremiah's affiliation. The Cyberspace Electronic Security Act of 1999 (CESA) is a bill proposed by the Clinton administration during the 106th United States Congress that enables the government to harvest keys used in encryption.  The Cyberspace Electronic Security Act gives law enforcement the ability to gain access to encryption keys and cryptography methods.  The initial version of this act enabled federal law enforcement agencies to secretly use monitoring, electronic capturing equipment and other technologies to access and obtain information.  These provisions were later stricken from the act, although federal law enforcement agencies still have a significant degree of latitude to conduct investigations relating to electronic information.  The act generated discussion about what capabilities should be allowed to law enforcement in the detection of criminal activity.  After vocal objections from civil liberties groups, the administration backed away from the controversial bill. This is a list of law enforcement agencies in Australia.  Law enforcement in Australia is carried out on federal, state, and local levels.  This is facilitated by various different uniformed 'sworn' law enforcement agencies and civilian 'regulatory' agencies.  Sworn law enforcement agencies generally consist of law enforcement officers that have powers of arrest, whereas regulatory agencies normally set out and enforce compliance of specific laws and regulations and are normally composed of civilians and or civilian investigators.  For more on law enforcement in Australia see Law enforcement in Australia. The sovereign citizen movement (also SovCit movement or SovCits) is a loose group of anti-government activists, litigants, tax protesters, financial scammers, and conspiracy theorists based mainly in the United States. Sovereign citizens have their own pseudolegal belief system based on misinterpretations of common law and claim to not be subject to any government statutes unless they consent to them. The movement appeared in the United States in the early 1970s and has since expanded to other countries; the similar freeman on the land movement emerged during the 2000s in Canada before spreading to other Commonwealth countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The FBI describes sovereign citizens as \"anti-government extremists who believe that even though they physically reside in this country, they are separate or 'sovereign' from the United States\".The sovereign citizen phenomenon is one of the main contemporary sources of pseudolaw. Sovereign citizens believe that courts have no jurisdiction over people and that the use of certain procedures (such as writing specific phrases on bills they do not want to pay) and loopholes can make one immune to government laws and regulations. They also regard most forms of taxation as illegitimate and reject Social Security numbers, driver's licenses, and vehicle registration. The movement may appeal to people facing financial or legal difficulties or wishing to resist perceived government oppression. As a result, it has grown significantly during times of economic or social crisis. Most schemes promoted by sovereign citizens aim to avoid paying taxes, ignore laws, eliminate debts, or extract money from the government. Sovereign citizen arguments have no basis in law and have never been successful in any court.American sovereign citizens claim that the United States federal government is illegitimate. Sovereign citizens outside of the U.S. hold similar beliefs about the government of their own countries. The movement can be traced back to American far-right groups such as the Posse Comitatus and the constitutionalist wing of the militia movement. While the sovereign citizen movement was originally associated with white supremacism and antisemitism, it now attracts people of various ethnicities, including a significant number of African Americans. The latter sometimes belong to self-declared Moorish sects.The majority of sovereign citizens are not violent. However, the methods advocated by the movement are certainly illegal. Sovereign citizens notably adhere to the fraudulent schemes promoted by the redemption \"A4V\" movement. The United States Marshals Service (USMS) is a federal law enforcement agency within the U.S. Department of Justice (see ).  It is the oldest American federal law enforcement agency, which was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 during the presidency of George Washington.  The Marshals Service is attached to the Executive branch of government, and is the enforcement arm of the federal courts.  It is the primary agency for fugitive operations, responsible for prisoner transport, the protection of officers of the court, and for the effective operation of the judiciary.  The Marshals Service operates the Witness Protection Program, and serves federal level arrest warrants.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Tiger Woods won his first U.S. Open by a record-setting fifteen strokes over runners-up Ernie Els and Miguel Ángel Jiménez – it remains the most dominating performance and victory in any major championship.  As the United States Golf Association wanted to begin the millennium with a memorable tournament, Pebble Beach was moved up two years in the rotation.  Notable golfers going into the tournament at large included Jack Nicklaus, playing in his final U.S. Open; Vijay Singh, the year's Masters winner; Ernie Els; and David Duval. The 1999 United States Open Championship was the 99th U.S. Open, held June 17–20 at Pinehurst Resort Course No. 2 in Pinehurst, North Carolina.  Payne Stewart won his second U.S. Open and third major championship, one stroke ahead of runner-up Phil Mickelson. The United States Open Championship, commonly known as the U.S. Open, is the annual open national championship of golf in the United States. It is the third of the four men's major golf championships, and is on the official schedule of both the PGA Tour and the European Tour. Since 1898 the competition has been 72 holes of stroke play (4 rounds on an 18-hole course), with the winner being the player with the lowest total number of strokes. It is staged by the United States Golf Association (USGA) in mid-June, scheduled so that, if there are no weather delays, the final round is played on the third Sunday. The U.S. Open is staged at a variety of courses, set up in such a way that scoring is very difficult, with a premium placed on accurate driving. As of 2024, the U.S. Open awards a $21.5 million purse, the largest of all four major championships. History The first U.S. Open was played on October 4, 1895, on a nine-hole course at the Newport Country Club in Newport, Rhode Island. It was a 36-hole competition and was played in a single day. Ten professionals and one amateur entered. The winner was Horace Rawlins, a 21-year-old Englishman, who had arrived in the U.S. earlier that year to take up a position at the host club. He received $150 cash out of a prize fund of $335, plus a $50 gold medal; his club received the Open Championship Cup trophy, which was presented by the USGA.In the beginning, the tournament was dominated by experienced British players until 1911, when John J. McDermott became the first native-born American winner. American golfers soon began to win regularly and the tournament evolved to become one of the four majors.Since 1911, the title has been won mostly by players from the United States. Since 1950, players from only six countries other than the United States have won the championship, most notably South Africa, which has won five times since 1965. A streak of four consecutive non-American winners occurred from 2004 to 2007 for the first time since 1910.

The population was 8,466 at the time of the 2020 Census. The Lenox Hills neighborhood is adjacent to Bethpage State Park and the rest of the town is within a fifteen-minute drive of the park. It is also approximately 37 mi (59 km) southeast of Midtown Manhattan and can be reached via the Ronkonkoma Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. The Long Island Expressway and Seaford Oyster Bay Expressway are the best way to reach Farmingdale from the city and the mainland.    History   The first European settler in the area was Thomas Powell, who arrived in 1687. On October 18, 1695, he purchased a 15-square-mile (39 km2) tract of land from three Native American tribes. This is known as the Bethpage Purchase and includes what is now Farmingdale – in addition to Bethpage, Melville, North Massapequa, Old Bethpage, Plainedge, and Plainview. One of two houses he erected in the area (built c. 1738) still stands on Merritts Road in Farmingdale. In the 1830s, anticipating construction of the Long Island Rail Road, land developer Ambrose George purchased a large tract of land between a community then known as Bethpage, now Old Bethpage, and an area in Suffolk County known as Hardscrabble. He built a general store in the western part of this property which he named Farmingdale. When the LIRR started service to the area in October 1841, it used the name Farmingdale for its latest stop, here, on the line it was building to Greenport. Stagecoaches took people from the Farmingdale station to Islip, Babylon, Patchogue, Oyster Bay South, and West Neck (Huntington area).  In 1886 a fire department was organized, and in 1904, Farmingdale incorporated as a village. The Lenox Hills Country Club, an 18-hole private golf course designed by Devereux Emmet, was developed north of the community in 1923 and was owned and operated by Benjamin F. Yoakum.

The U.S. Women's Open, one of 15 national golf championships conducted by the United States Golf Association (USGA), is the oldest of the LPGA Tour's five major championships, which includes the Chevron Championship, Women's PGA Championship, Women's Open Championship, and The Evian Championship.Established 78 years ago in 1946, the U.S. Women's Open is the only event to have been recognized as a major by the LPGA since the group's founding in 1950. Originally operated by the Women's Professional Golfers  Association (WPGA) for its first three years and the LPGA for the next four, it became a USGA event in 1953. Since 2018, the tournament has normally been held the week after Memorial Day. The U.S. Women's Open is the second major of the LPGA season and has the highest purse in women's golf. The most recent increase, announced in January 2022, saw the purse nearly double from its previous $5.5 million (2019–2021) to $10 million starting in 2022. The 2022 purse increase came about when the nonprofit health care company ProMedica was announced as the tournament's presenting sponsor.For 2020, it was the final major of the year and be held for the first time over two courses, as it was postponed to December, due to the COVID-19 pandemic that postponed golf tournaments from March through June.In 2007, international players outnumbered Americans for the first time. The 2008 tournament was won  South Korean Inbee Park, who became the event's youngest winner ever at age 19 years, 11 months, 17 days.  In 2021, Yuka Saso matched Park as the youngest winner ever.Since 2018, the U.S. Women's Open has normally been held prior to its men's counterpart rather than following it and the U.S. Senior Open. In announcing this schedule change, the USGA stated that it would \"provide optimum playing conditions for the world's best players across a broader variety of the country's finest golf courses.\"The playoff format was modified in 2018, reduced from three to two aggregate holes, followed by sudden death.

As a food additive it used under the E number E161a as a food coloring although it is not approved for use in the EU or USA.  It is listed as food additive 161a in Australia and New Zealand where it is approved for usage as an ingredient in food products. Manchester tart is a traditional English baked tart consisting of a shortcrust pastry shell, spread with raspberry jam, covered with a custard filling and topped with flakes of coconut and a Maraschino cherry.

The recipe consisted of puff pastry with a layer of jam and custard poured on top, topped with a sprinkling of sugar.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Manchester Tarts were regularly served in school dinners, often alongside hot custard. The tarts usually contained coconut and a cherry, and sometimes also a layer of chopped banana between the custard and the jam.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCustard tart\nList of custard desserts\nList of pies, tarts and flans\n Food portal Titanium dioxide, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania, is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium, chemical formula TiO2 .  When used as a pigment, it is called titanium white, Pigment White 6 (PW6), or CI 77891.  Generally it is sourced from ilmenite, rutile and anatase.  It has a wide range of applications, from paint to sunscreen to food coloring.  When used as a food coloring, it has E number E171.  World production in 2014 exceeded 9 million metric tons. Rúgbrauð (] ) is an Icelandic straight rye bread.  It is traditionally baked in a pot or steamed in special wooden casks by burying it in the ground near a hot spring, in which case it is known as \"hverabrauð\" or \"hot-spring-bread\".  Modern \"rúgbrauð\" is usually made in a square baking pan.  The bread is crustless, dark and very dense, usually rather sweet, and keeps for a long time.  It is often served with butter, mutton pâté, hangikjöt (smoked lamb), or with pickled herring.  Dry \"rúgbrauð\" would be ground and mixed with buttermilk to form a kind of porridge.  Stale \"rúgbrauð\" is often soaked, then made into \"brauðsúpa\" (bread soup) - that is, simmered with raisins and flavorings (usually lemon) and served hot with whipped cream as a dessert. Food coloring, or color additive, is any dye, pigment or substance that imparts color when it is added to food or drink.  They come in many forms consisting of liquids, powders, gels, and pastes.  Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in domestic cooking.  Food colorants are also used in a variety of non-food applications including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, home craft projects, and medical devices. Caramel color or caramel coloring is a water-soluble food coloring.  It is made by heat treatment of carbohydrates, in general in the presence of acids, alkalis, or salts, in a process called caramelization.  It is more fully oxidized than caramel candy, and has an odor of burnt sugar and a somewhat bitter taste.  Its color ranges from pale yellow to amber to dark brown. Custard tarts or flan pâtissier/parisien are a baked pastry consisting of an outer pastry crust filled with egg custard. History The development of custard is so intimately connected with the custard tart or pie that the word itself comes from Anglo-Norman *crustade (unattested), meaning a kind of pie. It is derived from Anglo-Norman crust (> English crust) corresponding to French croust. It is related to the 18th century French term croustade, probably borrowed from the Italian crostata (already mentioned 13th century), derived from crosta (croûte in French), more probably than the Occitan Occitan: croustado, lit. 'tart'. Some other names for varieties of custard tarts in the Middle Ages were doucettes and darioles. In 1399, the coronation banquet prepared for Henry IV included \"doucettys\".Medieval recipes generally included a shortcrust and puff  pastry case filled with a mixture of cream, milk, or broth, with eggs, sweeteners such as sugar or honey, and sometimes spices. Recipes existed as early as the fourteenth century that would still be recognisable as custard tarts today. Tarts could also be prepared with almond milk during times of fasting such as Lent, though this was rather expensive and would have been available only to the well-off. Often, savoury ingredients such as minced pork or beef marrow were also added (the combining of sweet and savoury ingredients was more common in medieval England), but unlike a modern quiche the custard filling itself was invariably sweet. In China, the tarts are dusted with cinnamon; in Britain, nutmeg is often used. Modern versions Modern custard tarts are usually made from shortcrust pastry, eggs, sugar, milk or cream, and vanilla, sprinkled with nutmeg and then baked. Unlike egg tart, custard tarts are normally served at room temperature. Maraschino Cherry may refer to:Maraschino cherry, a preserved, sweetened cherryMaraschino Cherry (film), a 1978 American adult erotic film Maraschino ( MARR-ə-SKEE-noh, -⁠SHEE-, Italian: [maraˈskiːno]) is a liqueur obtained from the distillation of Marasca cherries. The small, slightly sour fruit of the Marasca cherry tree (Prunus cerasus var. marasca), which grows wild along parts of the Dalmatian coast in Croatia, lends the liqueur its unique aroma. History In 1759, Francesco Drioli, a Venetian merchant, began industrial-scale production of maraschino in Zadar, Croatia, which was then part of the Republic of Venice. Drioli demonstrated the same brand of Venetian entrepreneurial spirit as other businessmen in the Veneto region who transformed grappa-distillation from household tradition into formal industry: in either case, the businesses strictly conformed to the rules and restrictions set down by the regional Distillers' Guild (Arte dell'acqua di vita).Francesco Drioli developed and perfected Giuseppe Carceniga's earlier innovative techniques for the distillation of Marasca cherries and in 1759 he founded the Fabbrica di Maraschino Francesco Drioli (Francesco Drioli Maraschino Factory). By the end of the 18th century his maraschino had already gained widespread fame and had cornered the major markets in Europe, especially in England. In the first advertisement in the London Morning Post and Daily Advertiser, dated 17 June 1779, the firm Johnson and Justerini informed \"the nobility and gentry\" of having \"just imported a large quantity of maraschino from Zara ... of the most exquisite flavour\" and in 1804 the Austrian Emperor granted the factory the title Imperial Regia Privilegiata entitling it to use the Imperial coat of arms. The liqueur was sought after by distinguished personages, rulers and courts from all over Europe and the Francesco Drioli factory held Royal Warrants, entitling them to use the royal coat of arms, from the royal households of Austria, Great Britain and Italy. British warships were sent from bases in Corfù and Malta to pick up shipments of maraschino for British royalty. A maraschino cherry ( or ) is a preserved, sweetened cherry, typically made from light-colored sweet cherries such as the Royal Ann, Rainier, or Gold varieties.  In their modern form, the cherries are first preserved in a brine solution usually containing sulfur dioxide and calcium chloride to bleach the fruit, then soaked in a suspension of food coloring (common red food dye, FD&C Red 40), sugar syrup, and other components. A maraschino cherry ( MARR-ə-SKEE-noh, -⁠SHEE-) is a preserved, sweetened cherry, typically made from light-colored sweet cherries such as the Royal Ann, Rainier, or Gold varieties. In their modern form, the cherries are first preserved in a brine solution usually containing sulfur dioxide and calcium chloride to bleach the fruit, then soaked in a suspension of food coloring (common red food dye is FD&C Red 40), sugar syrup, and other components.    Uses   Maraschino cherries are used in many alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and cocktails, including the tequila sunrise, the Queen Mary and the Shirley Temple, giving them the nickname cocktail cherries. (This term is also used to refer to other varieties, including Amarena, Balaton, and Bing, when used for the same purpose, typically soaked in alcohol or sugar.)  Sometimes the cherries, along with some of the maraschino syrup, are put into a glass of Coca-Cola to make an old-fashioned or homemade \"Cherry Coke\". As a garnish, they can be used to decorate frozen yogurt, baked ham, cakes, pastry, parfaits, milkshakes and ice cream sodas. They are an integral part of an American ice cream sundae, giving rise to the term \"cherry on top\" in more general usage. They are frequently included in canned fruit cocktail.    Europe  The name maraschino originates from the marasca cherry of Croatian origin and the maraschino liqueur made from it, in which marasca cherries were crushed and preserved after being pickled. Whole cherries preserved in this liqueur were known as \"maraschino cherries\". This had been a local means of preserving the fruit in Dalmatia. In the 19th century, these became popular in the rest of Europe, but the supply in Dalmatia was quite limited, so they became known as a delicacy for royalty and the wealthy. Because of the relative scarcity of the marasca, other cherries came to be preserved in various ways and sold as \"maraschino\".    United States  The cherries were first introduced in the United States in the late 19th century, where they were served in fine bars and restaurants.

A tart is a baked dish consisting of a filling over a pastry base with an open top not covered with pastry. The pastry is usually shortcrust pastry; the filling may be sweet or savoury, though modern tarts are usually fruit-based, sometimes with custard. Tartlet refers to a miniature tart; an example would be egg tarts. The categories of \"tart\", \"flan\", and \"pie\" overlap, with no sharp distinctions. History The French word tarte can be translated to mean either pie or tart, as both are mainly the same except a pie usually covers the filling in pastry, while flans and tarts leave it open.Tarts are thought to have either come from a tradition of layering food or to be a product of Medieval pie making. Enriched dough (i.e. shortcrust) is thought to have been first commonly used in 1550, approximately 200 years after pies. In this period, they were viewed as high-cuisine, popular with nobility, in contrast to the view of a commoner's pie. While originally savory, with meat fillings, culinary tastes led to sweet tarts prevailing, filling tarts instead with fruit and custard. Early medieval tarts generally had meat fillings, but later ones were often based on fruit and custard.An early tart was the Italian crostata, dating to at least the mid-15th century. It has been described as a \"rustic free-form version of an open fruit tart\". Description Tarts are typically free-standing with firm pastry base consisting of dough, itself made of flour, thick filling, and perpendicular sides while pies may have softer pastry, looser filling, and sloped sides, necessitating service from the pie plate. Varieties There are many types of tarts, with popular varieties including Treacle tart, meringue tart, tarte tatin and Bakewell tart. Food orange 7, the ethyl ester of beta-apo-8'-carotenic acid, is a carotenoid with an orange-red color.  It is found in small quantities in some plants, but is often produced commercially from apocarotenal (E160e).  It is used as a food coloring under the E number E160f and is approved for use in the EU and Australia and New Zealand where it is listed as food additive 160f; it is banned in the United States. Zarda (Urdu: ‎ ) is a traditional sweet dish from the Indian subcontinent, made by boiling rice with (orange) food coloring, milk and sugar, and flavoured with cardamoms, raisins, saffron, pistachios or almonds.  The name Zarda comes from Persian and Urdu word 'zard' meaning 'yellow', hence named since the food coloring added to the rice gives it a yellow color.  Zarda is typically served after a meal.  In the Indian subcontinent, zarda was and still remains a popular dessert on special occasions such as weddings. Cocadas are a traditional coconut candy or confectionery found in many parts of Latin America.  They are particularly popular in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia and Chile.  They are oven baked but are served at room temperature to provide their chewy and soft texture.  Made with eggs and shredded coconut, cocadas come in a variety of colors due to the modern use of food coloring, however the traditional variations are golden brown.  They are often garnished with almonds, either whole or chopped.  There are hundreds of cocadas recipes, from the typical hard, very sweet balls to cocadas that are almost the creamy texture of flan.  Other fruit, often dried, can be added to the cocadas to create variety, which will also lend to a wide spectrum of cocada colors.  Cocadas are mentioned as early as 1878 in Peru.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

The Trojans are a non-football member of the Ohio Valley Conference and a wrestling affiliate member of the Pac-12 Conference. The university offers 7 men's and 8 women's varsity sports. Little Rock has Sun Belt rivalries with all the West Division schools (Arkansas State, Louisiana–Monroe, Louisiana–Lafayette, Texas State, and UT Arlington). Little Rock's primary in-state rival is Arkansas State.For the 2005–06 basketball season, the Trojans moved into the $25 million Jack Stephens Center. This new facility almost doubled the seating capacity of the old Little Rock gym, with 5,600 seats and 149,000 square feet (13,800 m2) of space.On July 1, 2015, the Trojans officially announced they would no longer be branded as \"Arkansas–Little Rock\" or \"UALR,\" but will be the Little Rock Trojans effective immediately.Starting in the 2022-23 athletic season the Trojans will join the Ohio Valley Conference as their primary athletic conference. Sports  Basketball In the years since becoming a four-year university, Little Rock has won slightly more games than they've lost. However, during the six-year coaching tenure of Mike Newell, the Trojans made a big splash on the national stage. Appearing in their first ever NCAA tournament game in 1986, the 14th seeded Little Rock beat the heavily favored and 3rd seeded Notre Dame Fighting Irish, coached by Digger Phelps, now a college basketball analyst for ESPN, 90 to 83. The Trojans lost in the second round to North Carolina State, 80 to 66 in two overtimes.The 1986 NCAA Tournament success led to post-season appearances for the Trojans in each of the next four seasons. In 1987, Little Rock beat Baylor, Stephen F. Austin and California to make it to the National Invitation Tournament finals in New York City.  The Trojans lost to both LaSalle and Nebraska to finish fourth. The 2015 BYU Cougars women's soccer team represented BYU during the 2015 NCAA Division I women's soccer season.  The Cougars were coached for a 21st consecutive season by Jennifer Rockwood, who was co-coach in 1995 and became the solo head coach in 1996.  Before 1995 BYU women's soccer competed as a club team and not as a member of the NCAA.  The Cougars enter the 2015 season having won three consecutive West Coast Conference championships and having made the NCAA Tournament each of the last three seasons and in 16 of the 20 seasons that Rockwood has been the head coach.  The Cougars also come in having been picked to win the 2015 WCC women's soccer crown.  On the last day of the season BYU won their fourth consecutive WCC soccer title to automatically qualify for the NCAA Tournament.  BYU advanced to the second round of the College Cup where they were defeated by Stanford.  BYU finished the season at 16–3–2. The 2014–15 Murray State Racers men's basketball team represented Murray State University during the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.  The Racers, led by fourth year head coach Steve Prohm, played their home games at the CFSB Center and were members of the West Division of the Ohio Valley Conference.  They finished the season 29–6, 16–0 in OVC play to win the West Division championship and the overall OVC regular season championship.  After a 2–4 start, the Racers won 25 games in a row before losing in the championship game of the OVC Tournament to Belmont.  As a regular season champion who failed to win their conference tournament, they received an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament where they defeated UTEP in the first round and Tulsa in the second round before losing in the quarterfinals to Old Dominion. The 2015–16 Monmouth Hawks men's basketball team represented Monmouth University during the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.  The Hawks, led by fifth year head coach King Rice, played their home games at the Multipurpose Activity Center and were members of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC).  They finished the season 28–8, 17–3 in MAAC play to win the MAAC regular season championship.  They defeated Rider and Fairfield to advance to the championship game of the MAAC Tournament where they lost to Iona.  As a regular season conference champion who failed to win their conference tournament, they received an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament.  As one of the last four teams left out of the NCAA Tournament, they received a #1 seed in the NIT where they defeated Bucknell in the first round to advance to the second round where they lost to George Washington. The Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team represents Iowa State University (ISU) and competes in the Big 12 Conference of NCAA Division I. The Cyclones play their home games at Hilton Coliseum on Iowa State's campus. History  Early years (1908–1980) From 1907 to 1928, the Cyclones played in the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, managing a few winning records in-conference but no championships. In 1929, the Cyclones moved to the Big Six Conference and named Louis Menze as head coach. Over the next 19 years, Menze would lead the Cyclones to four conference championships (their only seasons with a winning conference record in this period). Two of these teams earned consideration for the then eight-team NCAA tournament; the 1941 squad lost in a pre-Tournament \"qualifying game\" to Creighton.  Three years later, the 1944 team beat Pepperdine to reach the semifinals in the tournament proper before losing its next game against eventual champion Utah, good for a spot in history as a Final Four participant.After Menze's last conference win in 1945 and subsequent resignation as coach in 1947 (he would remain Iowa State's athletic director until 1958, having taken the position in 1945), the Cyclones floated between the bottom and the middle of the conference for decades, their main claim to fame being two wins of the conference's annual \"Holiday tournament\", played between Christmas and New Year's Day in Kansas City, in 1955 and 1959. Neither these tournament wins, nor their regular season performances, qualified the Cyclones for postseason play in the 33 years between Menze's and Johnny Orr's stints in the head coaching position. However, the 1957 Cyclones were ranked #3 in the nation after handing Wilt Chamberlain's #1 Kansas its first loss.Gary Thompson outscored Chamberlain, while Don Medsker held Chamberlain to 17 points the 2nd lowest of his career and then hit the game winner at the buzzer. From the introduction of the Big Eight's postseason tournament in 1977 until Johnny Orr's fifth season in 1985, the Cyclones did not advance past their first game.In 1971, Maury John left Drake University to move to Iowa State. The Iowa State Cyclones are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent Iowa State University, located in Ames. The university is a member of the Big 12 Conference and competes in NCAA Division I, fielding 16 varsity teams (6 men's and 10 women's teams) in 12 sports.The \"Cyclones\" name dates back to 1895. That year, Iowa suffered an unusually high number of devastating cyclones (as tornadoes were called at the time). In September, the football team from what was then Iowa Agricultural College traveled to Northwestern University and defeated that team by a score of 36–0. The next day, the Chicago Tribune's headline read \"Struck by a Cyclone: It Comes from Iowa and Devastates Evanston Town.\" The article began, \"Northwestern might as well have tried to play football with an Iowa cyclone as with the Iowa team it met yesterday.\" The nickname stuck. Sports sponsored Iowa State's athletic director is Jamie Pollard. Since his arrival in 2005, Pollard has replaced head coaches in football, wrestling, men's basketball, gymnastics, soccer, cross country/track & field, women's golf, tennis, and softball. Additionally, he has initiated major renovations to Hilton Coliseum and Jack Trice Stadium, and constructed a basketball practice facility.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Were Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane both poets?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nCarlo Ginzburg (Italian: [ˈkarlo ˈɡintsburɡ]; born 15 April 1939) is an Italian historian and a proponent of the field of microhistory. He is best known for Il formaggio e i vermi (1976, English title: The Cheese and the Worms), which examined the beliefs of an Italian heretic, Menocchio, from Montereale Valcellina.In 1966, he published The Night Battles, an examination of the benandanti visionary folk tradition found in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Friuli in northeastern Italy.  He returned to looking at the visionary traditions of early modern Europe for his 1989 book Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath. Life The son of Natalia Ginzburg, a novelist, and Leone Ginzburg, a philologist, historian, and literary critic, Carlo Ginzburg was born in 1939 in Turin, Italy. His interest for history was influenced by the works of historians Delio Cantimori and Marc Bloch. He received a PhD from the University of Pisa in 1961. He subsequently held teaching positions at the University of Bologna, the University of California, Los Angeles (1988–2006), and the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. His fields of interest range from the Italian Renaissance to early modern European history, with contributions to art history, literary studies, and the theory of historiography.In 1979, Ginzburg formally requested that Pope John Paul II open the Inquisition Archives. While the immediate response of the Vatican has not yet come to light, a limited group of scholars had been granted access by 1991. In January 1998 the archives were formally opened to \"qualified researchers.\" Cardinal Ratzinger (who later became Pope Benedict XVI) credited Ginzburg, and his 1979 letter, as having been instrumental in the Vatican's decision to open these archives. Ginzburg had his doubts about using statistics to reach a judgment about the period. The last new poem meant to be published in Hart Crane's life, \"The Broken Tower\" (1932) has been widely acknowledged as one of the best lyrics of Crane's last years, if not his career.  In keeping with the varieties and difficulties of Crane criticism, the poem has been interpreted widely—as death ode, life ode, process poem, visionary poem, poem on failed vision—but its biographical impetus out of Crane's first heterosexual affair (with Peggy Cowley, estranged wife of Malcolm Cowley) is generally undisputed .  Written early in the year, the poem was rejected by \"Poetry\", and only appeared in print (in \"The New Republic\") after Crane's famous suicide by water (compare his great homosexual love-cycle \"Voyages\"). Leone Ginzburg (] ; ] ; ] ; 4 April 1909 – 5 February 1944) was an Italian editor, writer, journalist and teacher, as well as an important anti-fascist political activist and a hero of the resistance movement.  He was the husband of the renowned author Natalia Ginzburg and the father of the historian Carlo Ginzburg. Leone Ginzburg (Italian: [leˈoːne ˈɡintsburɡ], German: [ˈɡɪntsbʊʁk], Ukrainian: [ˈɡinzbʊrɡ]; 4 April 1909 – 5 February 1944) was an Italian editor, writer, journalist and teacher, as well as an important anti-fascist political activist and a hero of the resistance movement. He was the husband of the renowned author Natalia Ginzburg and the father of the historian Carlo Ginzburg. Early life and career Ginzburg was born in Odessa to a Jewish family. World War I began while the family was on vacation in Viareggio, Italy, and while his older brother and sister (then 15 and 18) travelled with their mother back to Russia, Leone remained, with his governess, for the duration of the war. He was reunited with his family when his mother and siblings fled to Italy following the October Revolution in Russia.He studied at the Liceo Ginnasio Massimo d'Azeglio in Turin. This school molded a group of intellectuals and political activists who would fight Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime and, eventually, help create the post-war democratic Italy. His classmates included such notable intellectuals as Norberto Bobbio, Piero Gobetti, Cesare Pavese, Giulio Einaudi, Massimo Mila, Vittorio Foa, Giancarlo Pajetta and Felice Balbo. During his time in Turin, he contributed to Il Baretti, a literary magazine launched by Piero Gobetti in 1924.In the early 1930s, Ginzburg taught Slavic Languages and Russian Literature at the University of Turin, and was credited with helping to introduce Russian authors to the Italian public. In 1933, Ginzburg co-founded, with Giulio Einaudi, the publishing house Einaudi. Family Sayings (Original title Lessico famigliare) is a novel by the Italian author Natalia Ginzburg, first published in 1963.  It is a semi-biographical description of aspects of the daily life of her family, dominated by her father, the renowned histologist, Giuseppe Levi.  The book is both an ironic and affectionate chronicle of life in the period 1920-1950, portrayed in terms of habits, behavior and, above all, linguistic communications, from which the book takes its title.  People and events are brought to life by what they do and what they say.  In addition to family members, including her mother, father, brothers and sisters the book also describes many friends and acquaintances. Giuseppe Levi (October 14, 1872 – February 3, 1965) was an Italian anatomist and histologist, professor of human anatomy (since 1916) at the universities of Sassari, Palermo and Turin.  He was born on October 14, 1872 in Trieste to Jewish parents, Michele Levi and Emma Perugia.  He was married to Lidia Tanzi and had five children: Gino, Mario, Alberto, Paola (who became the wife of Adriano Olivetti), and writer Natalia Ginzburg (wife of Leone Ginzburg and mother of Carlo Ginzburg), who described her father's personality in the successful Italian book \"Lessico famigliare\" (1963). Harold Hart Crane (July 21, 1899 – April 27, 1932) was an American poet.  Finding both inspiration and provocation in the poetry of T. S. Eliot, Crane wrote modernist poetry that was difficult, highly stylized, and ambitious in its scope.  In his most ambitious work, \"The Bridge\", Crane sought to write an epic poem, in the vein of \"The Waste Land\", that expressed a more optimistic view of modern, urban culture than the one that he found in Eliot's work.  In the years following his suicide at the age of 32, Crane has been hailed by playwrights, poets, and literary critics alike (including Robert Lowell, Derek Walcott, Tennessee Williams, and Harold Bloom), as being one of the most influential poets of his generation. Harold Hart Crane (July 21, 1899 – April 27, 1932) was an American poet. Inspired by the Romantics and his fellow  Modernists, Crane wrote highly stylized poetry, often noted for its complexity. His collection White Buildings (1926), featuring \"Chaplinesque\", \"At Melville's Tomb\", \"Repose of Rivers\" and \"Voyages\", helped to cement his place in the avant-garde literary scene of the time. The long poem The Bridge (1930) is an epic inspired by the Brooklyn Bridge. Crane was born in Garrettsville, Ohio to Clarence A. Crane and Grace Edna Hart. He dropped out of East High School in Cleveland during his junior year and left for New York City, promising his parents he would later attend Columbia University. Crane took various jobs, including in copywriting and advertising. Throughout the early 1920s, various small but well-respected literary magazines published some of Crane's poems, gaining him among the avant-garde a respect that  White Buildings ratified and strengthened. His ambition to synthesize America was expressed in The Bridge, intended to be an uplifting counter to T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land (1922). Initial critical reaction to it was mixed, with many praising the scope but criticizing the quality of the poems. On April 27, 1932, Crane, in an inebriated state, jumped off the steamship USS Orizaba and into the Gulf of Mexico while the ship was en route to New York. He left no suicide note, but witnesses believed his intentions to be suicidal. Throughout his life, he had multiple homosexual relations, many of which were described by, or otherwise influenced, his poetry. He had one known female partner, Peggy Cowley, around a year before his death. Contemporary opinion was mixed, with poets including Marianne Moore and Wallace Stevens criticizing his work and others, including William Carlos Williams and E. E. Cummings, praising it. William Rose Benét wrote that, with The Bridge, Crane \"failed in creating what might have been a truly great poem” but that it \"reveals potencies in the author that may make his next work even more remarkable.\" His last work, \"The Broken Tower\" (1932), was unfinished and published posthumously.

Throughout his life, he had multiple homosexual relations, many of which were described by, or otherwise influenced, his poetry. He had one known female partner, Peggy Cowley, around a year before his death. Marguerite Frances Cowley (née Baird; 1890 – September 23, 1970), known as Peggy Cowley and also as Peggy Baird and by her first married name Peggy Johns, was an American landscape painter. She was married to poet-playwright Orrick Johns and writer Malcolm Cowley and was the lover of playwright Eugene O'Neill and poet Hart Crane. Activism Baird was a member of the women's suffrage movement. In 1917, she invited Dorothy Day to join the National Woman's Party. They were jailed for 60 days for their protests but were released after 16 days and pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson.[1] Personal life After divorcing her first husband, Johns, she married Malcolm Cowley in 1919.  In 1931 she moved to Mexico to obtain a divorce. While there her long friendship with poet Hart Crane turned into Crane's first and only documented heterosexual affair. As Crane wrote to a friend about his romance with Peggy Cowley, \"Rather amazing things have happened to me since Xmas. Peggy Cowley ... is mainly responsible\".  This affair has since become a major point of interest for Crane scholars—particularly for those reading him with an eye toward his sexuality—as his engagement with heterosexual life is a determining theme in his last major poem, \"The Broken Tower\". Appearing at moments to be a highly symbolic affirmation of their relationship, as well as a denial of his homosexual past (the 'broken tower' can be read as a defeated phallus), the poem was written just months before Crane committed suicide by jumping off of a passenger ship in 1932, following a trip to Mexico.Though their relationship had begun to deteriorate by that time (Crane said he had \"misunderstood and misinterpreted Peggy's character quite badly\"), Cowley was with Crane on the boat, and she figures briefly, but poignantly, in the events leading up to his death.Hart Crane and family papers Almost thirty years later, she wrote about this period in an article for Venture, \"The Last Days of Hart Crane.\"After Crane's death, Cowley married twice more and converted to Catholicism at the age of 60. Cowley died of cancer at Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker Farm in Tivoli, New York, where Cowley had resided for ten years.

From 1962, he was the head of Hall Green Road primary school, West Bromwich.Griffiths was elected to Smethwick County Borough Council in 1955. At the 1959 election, he stood against Smethwick's sitting Member of Parliament (MP) Patrick Gordon Walker for the first time, and succeeded in reducing Gordon Walker's majority from 6,495 to 3,544. Griffiths became leader of the council's Conservative group in 1960, serving as a local councillor until 1963 when he resigned to stand again for the Smethwick parliamentary seat in the forthcoming general election. Elected MP for Smethwick Labour's victory in the 1964 election had been predicted, and Patrick Gordon Walker, who had been Shadow Foreign Secretary for 18 months, was expected to hold on to his seat. Instead, Griffiths gained the seat for the Conservatives on a 7% swing, in a county borough that had the highest percentage of recent immigrants to England. Racial discrimination was common in the constituency and nationally; the local Labour club operated a colour bar.In what Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson later described as an \"utterly squalid\" campaign, Conservative party members were accused of having used the slogan \"If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour\". Colin Jordan, a British Neo-Nazi and leader of the British Movement, claimed that members of his group had produced the initial slogan as well as spread the poster and sticker campaign; Jordan's group in the past had also campaigned on other slogans, such as: \"Don't vote – a vote for Tory, Labour or Liberal is a vote for more Blacks!\". Although Griffiths himself did not coin the phrase or approve its use, he refused to disown it. Rani Mukerji is an Indian actress known for her work in Bollywood films.  She made her screen debut with a supporting role in \"Biyer Phool\" (1996), a Bengali film directed by her father Ram Mukherjee.  Her first leading role was that of a rape victim in the 1997 social drama \"Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat\", for which she won a special jury trophy at the Screen Awards ceremony.

        "answer": "yes",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Was either the Tet Offensive or Western Allied invasion of Germany started on a holiday?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nBritish logistics supported the operations of Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group in the Western Allied invasion of Germany from 8 January 1945 until the end of the Second World War in Europe on 8 May 1945. To conserve scarce manpower, the British and Canadian forces employed mechanisation and materiel for maximum effect in combat operations. This involved prodigious use of ammunition, fuel, and equipment, which in turn demanded a first-class military logistics system. By this time, the British Army was highly experienced, professional, and proficient.Originally scheduled to start at the beginning of January 1945, when the ground would have been frozen, Operation Veritable, the 21st Army Group's advance to the Rhine, was delayed for five weeks by the German Ardennes Offensive. It was therefore conducted over muddy and sometimes flooded ground, and roads were sometimes impassable even to four-wheel-drive vehicles. The offensive was supported by 600 field and 300 medium guns. Over 2.5 million rounds of 25-pounder ammunition were made available. The army roadheads were mainly supplied by rail. Fuels were brought by tankers and the Operation Pluto pipeline from the UK, and delivered by barge and pipeline to the army roadheads. Special arrangements were made to supply the Royal Air Force's Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation, which consumed 410,000 litres (90,000 imp gal) a night, and the Gloster Meteor jet fighters, which consumed 14,000 litres (3,000 imp gal) of kerosene each day. Montgomery's armies were reinforced by the redeployment of three divisions from Italy under Operation Goldflake.The next major operation was Operation Plunder—the assault crossing of the Rhine on 23 March. For this the British Second Army and the US Ninth Army deployed 2,144 field and medium guns, augmented by 3,337 anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns. A large force of engineer units was assembled for the operation: 37,000 British and Canadian engineers and pioneers, and 22,000 American engineers. Every available amphibious craft was collected, and they were joined by a Royal Navy contingent of 36 LCMs and 36 LCVPs that were transported by road across Holland and Belgium to participate. Operation Plunder included an airborne operation, Operation Varsity, in which two airborne divisions were landed with a day's supply of food, fuel, and petrol. The year 1968 saw major developments in the Vietnam War. The military operations started with an attack on a US base by the North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Viet Cong (VC) on January 1, ending a truce declared by the Pope and agreed upon by all sides. At the end of January, the PAVN and VC launched the Tet Offensive.Hanoi erred monumentally in its certainty that the offensive would trigger a supportive uprising of the population. PAVN/VC troops throughout the South, from Hue to the Mekong Delta, attacked in force for the first time in the war, but to devastating cost as the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and American troops killed close to 37,000 of the ill-supported enemy in less than a month for losses of 3,700 and 7,600 respectively. These reversals on the battlefield (the VC would never again fight effectively as a cohesive force) failed to register on the American home front, however and fueled what would ultimately prove to be a propaganda victory for Hanoi.U.S. troop numbers peaked in 1968 with President Johnson approving an increased maximum number of U.S. troops in Vietnam at 549,500. The year was the most expensive in the Vietnam War with the American spending US$77.4 billion (US$ 678 billion in 2024) on the war. The year also became the deadliest of the Vietnam War for America and its allies with 27,915 ARVN soldiers killed and the Americans suffering 16,592 killed compared to around two hundred thousand PAVN/VC killed. The deadliest  day of the Vietnam War for the U.S. was 31 January at the start of the Tet Offensive when 246 Americans were killed in action. January 1-2 JanuaryThe PAVN violated the New Year's truce in the New Year's Day Battle of 1968. Among the Americans fighting were future writer Larry Heinemann and future film director Oliver Stone. The PAVN lost 328 killed, while U.S. losses were 23 killed.In Newsweek magazine Robert Komer touted the early success of the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) pacification program he led. Tet 1969 refers to the attacks mounted by principally forces of North Vietnam and Viet Cong in February 1969 in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, one year after the original Tet Offensive. American logistics in the Western Allied invasion of Germany supported the American and French operations in Northwest Europe during the Second World War from 26 January 1945  until the end of World War II in Europe on 8 May 1945.By the end of January 1945, the American forces had recovered from the disruption to the supply system and the large losses of materiel inflicted by the German offensives in the Ardennes and Alsace. Sixty-eight ships loaded with replacement ordnance were dispatched from the United States. Casualties were harder to replace, and about 49,000 men were transferred from service units to the infantry branch. The Allied forces had to advance across the Rhineland, which was in the grip of thaws, rains and floods. They were then confronted by the Rhine, the most formidable barrier to the Allied advance since the English Channel. The river was crossed and bridged, and railways and pipelines were run across it. Most supplies were delivered by rail, and five railway bridges over the Rhine supported the final American advance into the heart of Germany.Once across the Rhine, combat losses in terms of tanks, vehicles and equipment, and the expenditure of ammunition declined, while shortages of fuel and spare parts developed, as was to be expected in fast-moving mobile operations. The American logistics system was stretched, but came nowhere near breaking point. The railheads were pushed forward, the rehabilitation of the network keeping pace with the advance. No less than twenty-six engineer general service regiments worked on the railways, and by late April rail had supplanted motor transport and was carrying the bulk of supplies across the Rhine. By 8 May, when the war in Europe ended, railheads had been established at Stendal, Magdeburgy, Leipzig, Regensburg and Stuttgart in Germany. The Motor Transport Service organized XYZ, an express road service that moved supplies from the railheads to the forward units. Air supply also played its part in bringing the campaign to a successful conclusion, with  a substantial amount of gasoline delivered by air in the final weeks. Background The campaign in Northwest Europe had commenced on 6 June 1944 (D-Day), with Operation Overlord, the Allied Normandy landings. By early September, the Allied forces had reached the Dutch and German borders in the north and the Moselle in the south, but the advance came to a halt due to logistical difficulties, particularly fuel shortages, and stiffening German resistance. The Battle of Coral–Balmoral (12 May – 6 June 1968) was a series of actions fought during the Vietnam War between the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) and the North Vietnamese 7th Division and Viet Cong Main Force units, 40 km north-east of Saigon.  Following the defeat of the communist Tet offensive in January and February, in late April two Australian infantry battalions—the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment (RAR)—with supporting arms, were again deployed from their base at Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy Province to positions astride infiltration routes leading to Saigon to interdict renewed movement against the capital.  Part of the wider allied Operation Toan Thang I, it was launched in response to intelligence reports of another impending communist offensive, yet the Australians experienced little fighting during this period.  Meanwhile, the Viet Cong successfully penetrated the capital on 5 May, plunging Saigon into chaos during the May Offensive in an attempt to influence the upcoming Paris peace talks scheduled to begin on the 13th.  During three days of intense fighting the attacks were repelled by US and South Vietnamese forces, and although another attack was launched by the Viet Cong several days later, the offensive was again defeated with significant losses on both sides, causing extensive damage to Saigon and many civilian casualties.  By 12 May the fighting was over, and the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong were forced to withdraw having suffered heavy casualties.  US casualties were also heavy and it proved to be their most costly week of the war. During the early morning hours of 1 May, communist units initiated PHASE II of the Tet Offensive of 1968 (also known as the May Offensive, \"Little Tet\", and \"Mini-Tet\") by striking 119 targets throughout South Vietnam, including Saigon.  This time, however, allied intelligence was better prepared, removing the element of surprise.  Most of the communist forces were intercepted by allied screening elements before they reached their targets.  13 NLF battalions, however, managed to slip through the cordon and once again plunged Saigon into chaos.  Severe fighting occurred at Phú Lâm (where it took two days to root out the 267th NLF Local Force Battalion), around the Y-Bridge in Saigon, and at Tan Son Nhut Air Base.  By 12 May the offensive was over as NLF forces withdrew from the area leaving behind over 3,000 dead and 7,500 wounded. General Matthew Bunker Ridgway (March 3, 1895 – July 26, 1993) was the 19 Chief of Staff of the United States Army.  He served with great distinction during World War II, where he was the Commanding General (CG) of the 82nd Airborne Division, leading it in action in Sicily, Italy and Normandy, before taking command of the newly formed XVIII Airborne Corps in August 1944, holding this post until the end of the war, commanding it in the Battle of the Bulge, Operation Varsity and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. Tet 1969 refers to the attacks mounted by principally North Vietnamese forces in February 1969 in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, one year after the original Tet Offensive. The Western Allied invasion of Germany was coordinated by the Western Allies during the final months of hostilities in the European theatre of World War II.  The Allied invasion of Germany started with the Western Allies crossing the Rhine River in March 1945 before fanning out and overrunning all of western Germany from the Baltic in the north to Austria in the south before the Germans surrendered on 8 May 1945.  This is known as the \"Central Europe Campaign\" in United States military histories. The Western Allied invasion of Germany was coordinated by the Western Allies during the final months of hostilities in the European theatre of World War II. In preparation for the Allied invasion of Germany east of the Rhine, a series of offensive operations were designed to seize and capture its east and west banks: Operation Veritable and Operation Grenade in February 1945, and Operation Lumberjack and Operation Undertone in March 1945; these are considered separate from the main invasion operation. The Allied invasion of Germany east of the Rhine started with the Western Allies crossing the river on 22 March 1945 before fanning out and overrunning all of western Germany from the Baltic in the north to the Alpine passes in the south, where they linked up with troops of the U.S. Fifth Army in Italy. Combined with the capture of Berchtesgaden, any hope of Nazi leadership continuing to wage war from a so-called \"national redoubt\" or escape through the Alps was crushed, shortly followed by unconditional German surrender on 8 May 1945. This is known as the Central Europe Campaign in United States military histories. By early 1945, events favored the Allied forces in Europe. On the Western Front, the Allies had been fighting in Germany with campaigns against the Siegfried Line since the Battle of Aachen, the Battle of Metz and the Battle of Hürtgen Forest in late 1944 and by January 1945, had pushed the Germans back to their starting points during the Battle of the Bulge. The failure of this offensive exhausted Germany's strategic reserve, leaving it ill-prepared to resist the final Allied campaigns in Europe. Additional losses in the Rhineland further weakened the German Army, leaving shattered remnants of units to defend the east bank of the Rhine. On 7 March, the Allies seized the intact bridge across the Rhine at Remagen, and established a large bridgehead on the river's east bank. During Operation Lumberjack, Operation Plunder and Operation Undertone, German casualties during February–March 1945 are estimated at 400,000 men, including 280,000 men captured as prisoners of war. On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Red Army (including the Polish Armed Forces in the East under Soviet command), had taken most of Poland, launched an offensive into East Prussia and began their invasion into Eastern Germany in February 1945, and by March were within striking distance of Berlin. The Western Allied invasion of Germany was coordinated by the Western Allies during the final months of hostilities in the European theatre of World War II. In preparation for the Allied invasion of Germany east of the Rhine, a series of offensive operations were designed to seize and capture its east and west banks: Operation Veritable and Operation Grenade in February 1945, and Operation Lumberjack and Operation Undertone in March 1945; these are considered separate from the main invasion operation. The Allied invasion of Germany east of the Rhine started with the Western Allies crossing the river on 22 March 1945 before fanning out and overrunning all of western Germany from the Baltic in the north to the Alpine passes in the south, where they linked up with troops of the U.S. Fifth Army in Italy. Combined with the capture of Berchtesgaden, any hope of Nazi leadership continuing to wage war from a so-called \"national redoubt\" or escape through the Alps was crushed, shortly followed by unconditional German surrender on 8 May 1945. This is known as the Central Europe Campaign in United States military histories. By early 1945, events favored the Allied forces in Europe. On the Western Front, the Allies had been fighting in Germany with campaigns against the Siegfried Line since the Battle of Aachen, the Battle of Metz and the Battle of Hürtgen Forest in late 1944 and by January 1945, had pushed the Germans back to their starting points during the Battle of the Bulge. The failure of this offensive exhausted Germany's strategic reserve, leaving it ill-prepared to resist the final Allied campaigns in Europe. Additional losses in the Rhineland further weakened the German Army, leaving shattered remnants of units to defend the east bank of the Rhine. On 7 March, the Allies seized the intact bridge across the Rhine at Remagen, and established a large bridgehead on the river's east bank. The Huế Massacre (Vietnamese: \"Thảm sát tại Huế Tết Mậu Thân\" , or \"Thảm sát Tết Mậu Thân ở Huế, \"lit.  translation: \"Tet Offensive Massacre in Huế\") is the name given to the summary executions and mass killings perpetrated by the Viet Cong (VC) and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) during their capture, occupation and later withdrawal from the city of Huế during the Tet Offensive, considered one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the Vietnam War. The 21st Army Group was a World War II British headquarters formation, in command of two field armies and other supporting units, consisting primarily of the British Second Army and the First Canadian Army.  Established in London during July 1943, under the command of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), it was assigned to Operation Overlord, the Western Allied invasion of Europe, and was an important Allied force in the European Theatre.  The 21st Army Group operated in Northern France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany from June 1944 until the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, after which it was redesignated the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). The Viet Cong was an epithet and umbrella term to call the communist-driven armed movement and united front organization in South Vietnam. Formally organized as and led by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and nominally conducted military operations under the name of the Liberation Army of South Vietnam (LASV), the movement fought under the direction of North Vietnam against the South Vietnamese and United States governments during the Vietnam War. The organization had both guerrilla and regular army units, as well as a network of cadres who organized and mobilized peasants in the territory the Viet Cong controlled. During the war, communist fighters and some anti-war activists claimed that the Viet Cong was an insurgency indigenous to the South that represented the legitimate rights of people in South Vietnam, while the U.S. and South Vietnamese governments portrayed the group as a tool of North Vietnam. It was later conceded by the modern Vietnamese communist leadership that the movement was actually under the North Vietnamese political and military leadership, aiming to unify Vietnam under a single banner.North Vietnam established the National Liberation Front on December 20, 1960, at Tân Lập village in Tây Ninh Province to foment insurgency in the South. Many of the Viet Cong's core members were volunteer \"regroupees\", southern Viet Minh who had resettled in the North after the Geneva Accord (1954). Hanoi gave the regroupees military training and sent them back to the South along the Ho Chi Minh trail in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Viet Cong called for the unification of Vietnam and the overthrow of the American-backed South Vietnamese government. The Viet Cong's best-known action was the Tet Offensive, an assault on more than 100 South Vietnamese urban centers in 1968, including an attack on the U.S. embassy in Saigon. The offensive riveted the attention of the world's media for weeks, but also overextended the Viet Cong. Later communist offensives were conducted predominantly by the North Vietnamese. The organization officially merged with the Fatherland Front of Vietnam on February 4, 1977, after North and South Vietnam were officially unified under a communist government. Names The term Việt Cộng appeared in Saigon newspapers beginning in 1956. It is a contraction of Việt Nam cộng sản (Vietnamese communist). The earliest citation for Viet Cong in English is from 1957. American soldiers referred to the Viet Cong as Victor Charlie or V-C. Vietnamization of the war was a policy of the Richard Nixon administration to end U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War through a program to \"expand, equip, and train South Vietnam's forces and assign to them an ever-increasing combat role, at the same time steadily reducing the number of U.S. combat troops.\"  Brought on by the Viet Cong's Tet Offensive, the policy referred to U.S. combat troops specifically in the ground combat role, but did not reject combat by the U.S. Air Force, as well as the support to South Vietnam, consistent with the policies of U.S. foreign military assistance organizations.  U.S. citizens' mistrust of their government that had begun after the offensive worsened with the release of news about U.S. soldiers massacring civilians at My Lai (1968), the invasion of Cambodia (1970), and the leaking of the Pentagon Papers (1971). The Tet Offensive (Vietnamese: \"Sự kiện Tết Mậu Thân 1968\" , or \"Tổng tiến công và nổi dậy Tết Mậu Thân\") was one of the largest military campaigns of the Vietnam War, launched on January 30, 1968, by forces of the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam against the forces of the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the United States Armed Forces, and their allies.  It was a campaign of surprise attacks against military and civilian command and control centers throughout South Vietnam.  The name of the offensive comes from the Tết holiday, the Vietnamese New Year, when the first major attacks took place. The Tet Offensive was a major escalation and one of the largest military campaigns of the Vietnam War. The Viet Cong (VC) and North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) launched a surprise attack on 30 January 1968 against the forces of the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), the United States Armed Forces and their allies. It was a campaign of surprise attacks against military and civilian command and control centers throughout South Vietnam. The name is the truncated version of the Lunar New Year festival name in Vietnamese, Tết Nguyên Đán, with the offense chosen during a holiday period as most ARVN personnel were on leave. The purpose of the wide-scale offensive by the Hanoi Politburo was to trigger political instability in a belief that mass armed assault on urban centers would trigger defections and rebellions. The offensive was launched prematurely in the early morning hours of 30 January in large parts of the I and II Corps Tactical Zones of South Vietnam. This early attack allowed allied forces some time to prepare defensive measures. When the main operation began during the early morning hours of 31 January, the offensive was countrywide; eventually more than 80,000 PAVN/VC troops struck more than 100 towns and cities, including 36 of 44 provincial capitals, five of the six autonomous cities, 72 of 245 district towns and the southern capital.: 8  The offensive was the largest military operation conducted by either side up to that point in the war. Hanoi had launched the offensive in the belief that it would trigger a popular uprising leading to the collapse of the South Vietnamese government. Although the initial attacks stunned the allies, causing them to lose control of several cities temporarily, they quickly regrouped, repelled the attacks and inflicted heavy casualties on PAVN/VC forces. The popular uprising anticipated by Hanoi never materialized. During the Battle of Huế, intense fighting lasted for a month, resulting in the destruction of the city. During its occupation, the PAVN/VC executed thousands of people in the Massacre at Huế. Around the American combat base at Khe Sanh, fighting continued for two more months. The offensive was a military defeat for North Vietnam, as neither uprisings nor ARVN unit defections occurred in South Vietnam. However, this offensive had far-reaching consequences for its effect on the views of the Vietnam War by the American public and the world broadly.

Several of Björk's albums have reached the top 20 on the US Billboard 200 chart. \"Violently Happy\" is a song by Icelandic singer Björk, released as the fifth and final single from her album \"Debut\" in 1994.  The song was written by Björk and Nellee Hooper, who helped her in writing and producing most of the album.  The lyrics speak of Björk feeling a love so intense that it is actually dangerous, requesting that her lover return to \"calm her down\".  Musically, it's an upbeat song.  \"Violently Happy\" peaked at #13 in the UK and reached #4 on the US dance charts. \"Violently Happy\" is a song by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk, released in March 1994 by One Little Indian as the fifth and final single from her debut album, Debut (1993).

The song received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its musicality and its dance-pop appeal. The song received an accompanying music video which was shot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, in which Björk and many guest appearances (including a then unknown Norman Reedus) dance frantically in a kind of asylum while they cut out their hair or parts of dolls. Björk performed the song live on TV a few times, including on Top of the Pops.    Background  After leaving The Sugarcubes, Björk traveled to London where she began having contacts with electronic music, and that inspired her to change her musical style from the pop-rock sounds of the Sugarcubes to a more alternative and electronic style of music. \"Violently Happy\" was released as the last single from Debut and demonstrates this musical shift. Björk explained:  \"Violently Happy\" is about when you’re a junkie on exchanging emotion, not at one but at the level 200. That thing. And then the person goes away and you really miss someone. When you’re with that person you’re really peaceful because you get what you need back and you both give everything you need to give. And that person goes away and all that exchange is not there so you get your kicks elsewhere, you end up running on rooftops in blizzards, drinking 97 tequilas just to feel. You know what I mean. So it starts off really happy then the longer the person’s away from you, it starts getting self-destructive. Björk further said that the song was inspired by her living in Reykjavík and being far away from her lover: \"For me, it's quite a brave thing. It's like putting your diary out for everyone to read. \"Violently Happy\" is a song by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk, released in March 1994 by One Little Indian as the fifth and final single from her debut album, Debut (1993).

Debut is the international debut studio album by Icelandic recording artist Björk, released in July 1993 by One Little Indian and Elektra Entertainment. It was produced by Björk and Nellee Hooper. It was Björk's first recording following the dissolution of her previous band, the Sugarcubes. The album departed from the rock style of her previous work and drew from an eclectic variety of styles, including electronic pop, house music, jazz and trip hop.Debut received critical acclaim from British music critics, though American reviews were mixed. It exceeded sales expectations, charting at number two in Iceland, three in the United Kingdom, and 61 in the US. It was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the US, where it remains Björk's best-selling album.Five singles were released from Debut: \"Human Behaviour\", \"Venus as a Boy\", \"Play Dead\", \"Big Time Sensuality\" and \"Violently Happy\". All charted in the UK, with only \"Human Behaviour\", \"Violently Happy\" and \"Big Time Sensuality\" charting on dance and modern rock charts in the US. Background and production While performing as the vocalist of Icelandic alternative rock group the Sugarcubes, Björk approached Ásmundur Jónsson of Bad Taste and producer Derek Birkett of One Little Indian Records with a demo cassette of her own songs. The demo included versions of songs that appeared on Debut, including \"The Anchor Song\" and \"Aeroplane\". After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus, Björk moved to London, England, where she and Birkett worked on the details of what would become Debut. The Sugarcubes' music did not fit Björk's taste, and her contact with London's underground club culture of the late 1980s and early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity. She said: \"As a music nerd, I just had to follow my heart, and my heart was those beats that were happening in England. And maybe what I'm understanding more and more as I get older, is that music like Kate Bush has really influenced me. Brian Eno. Acid. Electronic beats. Labels like Warp.\"Björk had already written half the songs for Debut, but had nothing recorded.

Ricardo López (January 14, 1975 – September 12, 1996), also known as \"the Björk stalker\", was a Uruguayan-American stalker who attempted to murder the Icelandic singer Björk.López was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, and moved to Lawrenceville, Georgia with his family at a young age, and began working as a pest exterminator. He had poor self-esteem, was socially reclusive, and eventually developed an obsession with Björk in 1993. Though he did not hope to be sexually engaged with her, he was particularly angry over her brief relationship with the English musician Goldie, due to the color of his skin. Over the course of nearly nine months in 1996, he made video diaries about her and other topics, at his apartment in Hollywood, Florida.On September 12, 1996, López mailed a letter bomb, rigged with sulfuric acid, to Björk's residence in London. He recorded a final video diary explaining his motivations, and ended it by filming his suicide by gunshot. Hollywood police found his body and the videos four days after his death and contacted Scotland Yard, who located the bomb in a London postal sorting office. The parcel was safely detonated and Björk was unharmed. Early life Ricardo López was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, on January 14, 1975, into a middle-class family, which moved to the United States and settled in Lawrenceville, Georgia. He had a good relationship with his family, and was described as easygoing but introverted. He had a few male friends, but no female friends, nor a girlfriend. In a diary found by police, López expressed feelings of shame and inadequacy, as well as feelings of social awkwardness around women. Journalist Paolo Pellegrini wrote that López had been diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome.With aspirations to become a famous artist, López dropped out of high school. However, he did not seriously pursue an artistic career due to his feelings of inferiority, and fear of being denied entry into art school. He intermittently worked for his brother's pest control business to support himself. The Poster Boy were a Hungarian indie rock band from Budapest, Hungary.

It was recorded at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 17 July 1975 as part of his Natty Dread Tour.The live version of the song ranked No. 37 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.In 2005, the live version of the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Writing and composition Although Bob Marley is widely believed to have written the song, or at least the melody, songwriting credit was given to Vincent Ford, a friend of Marley's who ran a soup kitchen in Trenchtown, the ghetto of Kingston, Jamaica, where Marley grew up (he specifically mentions the Government Yards of Trenchtown, a public housing project).  The royalty payments received by Ford ensured his efforts would continue.The original studio version of the song used a drum machine. Jean Roussel provided the arrangement and Hammond organ parts for this recording.The title and main refrain, \"No Woman, No Cry\", means \"Woman, don't cry\". The lyric is sometimes misunderstood outside Jamaica to mean \"if there is no woman, there is no reason to cry\". The lyric is rendered \"No, woman, nuh cry\" in Jamaican Patois. The \"nuh\" is pronounced with a short schwa vowel (a \"mumbled\" vowel, often represented as \"uh\" in spelling) and represents a clitic (\"weakened\") form of \"no\".

It was released in November 1996 as the fourth single from their second studio album, The Score (1996). The song was produced by Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill.

One of the first results of Harrison's discovery of this instrument was \"Woman Don't You Cry For Me\". He later said that the title of the song might have been suggested by Bramlett. The song almost went on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass, but instead appeared on Thirty Three & 1/3, released in 1976. In May 1977, it also appeared as the B-side to the third single off the album in the UK, \"It's What You Value\".\n\"Woman Don't You Cry for Me\" is one of several bottleneck-inspired Harrison tunes from the period − \"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\", \"I Dig Love\", \"Māya Love\" and \"Hari's on Tour (Express)\" being others.

The song was written and composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were researching the life of Argentine leader Eva Perón. It appears at the opening of the first and second acts, as well as near the end of the show, initially as the spirit of the dead Eva exhorting the people of Argentina not to mourn her, during Eva's speech from the balcony of the Casa Rosada, and during her final broadcast.The Evita album had taken 3–4 months to record, since Rice was not satisfied with the intensity of the initial recordings. The song had a number of different titles before \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" was chosen as the final one. The song shares its melody with \"Oh What a Circus\" from the same show and lyrically consists of platitudes where Eva tries to win the favour of the people of Argentina. It was released in the United Kingdom on 12 November 1976 as the first single from the album, accompanied by national and trade advertising, full-colour posters, display sleeves as well as radio interviews.The song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and earned a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), with over a million copies sold. It also reached the top of the charts in Australia, Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand and the Netherlands. \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" was critically appreciated, with Rice and Lloyd Webber winning the 1977 Ivor Novello award in the category of Best Song Musically and Lyrically. When Evita moved to a London theatre, Covington—who had become disenchanted with the whole project—refused to reprise the part of Eva, and the role went to Elaine Paige. \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" has been covered by multiple artists, including The Carpenters, Olivia Newton-John, and Sinéad O'Connor as well as actors Lea Michele and Chris Colfer from the TV series Glee‍.In 1996, American singer Madonna played the title role in the film adaptation of the musical and recorded her rendition of \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\". Released as the second single from the film soundtrack on 16 December 1996, her version received positive reviews from music critics who praised her vocal performance. The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3 is a compilation album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, that was released on 11 June 2007 in the UK with a digital version released in the U.S. on iTunes Store, on 12 June 2007.  Manhattan/EMI Music Catalog Marketing released the CD version of the album on 19 June 2007 in the United States.  This new two-disc collection of 31 tracks has been compiled by Morrison himself.

On the album's track listing, \"Angels Cry\" is preceded by a one-minute, four second prelude called \"Angel (The Prelude)\", which consists of Carey performing purely in her whistle register.  The prelude then leads into \"Angels Cry\", a song about trying to fix a broken relationship because true love only happens once.  Carey released \"Angels Cry\" as a remix single featuring Ne-Yo in January 2010 for a proposed \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\" remix album called \"Angels Advocate\", which was ultimately shelved. \"Cry, Cry, Cry\" is a song written by John Scott Sherrill and Don Devaney, and recorded by American country music group Highway 101.

The lab is located at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Quantico, Virginia.  Opening November 24, 1932, the lab was first known as the \"Technical Laboratory\".  It became a separate division when the \"Bureau of Investigation\" (BOI) was renamed as the FBI. An electrophorus or electrophore is a simple manual capacitive generator used to produce electrostatic charge via the process of electrostatic induction.  A first version of it was invented in 1762 by Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke, but Italian scientist Alessandro Volta improved and popularized the device in 1775, and is sometimes erroneously credited with its invention.  The word \"electrophorus\" was coined by Volta from the Greek ήλεκτρον ('elektron'), and ϕέρω ('phero'), meaning 'electricity bearer'. St. Louis Motor Carriage Company was a manufacturer of automobiles at 1211–13 North Vandeventer Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri, founded by George Preston Dorris (later credited with developing and patenting the float-carburetor) and John French in 1898, with French taking charge of marketing and Dorris heading engineering and production.  St. Louis Motor Carriage was the first of many St. Louis automakers and produced automobiles from 1899 to 1907. The Volta Laboratory (also known as the \"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory\", the \"Bell Carriage House\" and the \"Bell Laboratory\") and the Volta Bureau were created in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. by Alexander Graham Bell. The Volta Laboratory (also known as the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, the Bell Carriage House and the Bell Laboratory) and the Volta Bureau were created in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., by Alexander Graham Bell. The Volta Laboratory was founded in 1880–1881 with Charles Sumner Tainter and Bell's cousin, Chichester Bell, for the research and development of telecommunication, phonograph and other technologies. Using funds generated by the Volta Laboratory, Bell later founded the Volta Bureau in 1887 \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf\", and merged with the American Association for the Promotion and Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (AAPTSD) in 1908. It was renamed as the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf in 1956 and then the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in 1999.    History  The current building, a U.S. National Historic Landmark, was constructed in 1893 under the direction of Alexander Graham Bell to serve as a center of information for deaf and hard of hearing persons. Bell, best known for receiving the first telephone patent in 1876, was also a prominent figure of his generation in the education of the deaf. His grandfather, father, and elder brother were teachers of speech and the younger Bell worked with them. Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Bell moved to Canada with his family in 1870 following the deaths of his brothers, and a year later moved to Boston to teach at a special day school for deaf children. Both Bell's mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing his life's work. He became a renowned educator by opening a private normal class to train teachers of speech to the deaf and as a professor of vocal physiology and the mechanics of speech at Boston University. During this time he also invented an improved phonautograph, the multiple telegraph, the speaking telegraph, or telephone, and numerous other devices. In 1879, Bell and his wife Mabel Hubbard, who had been deaf from early childhood, moved to Washington, D.C. The following year, the French government awarded Bell the Volta Prize of 50,000 francs (approximately US$330,000 in current dollars) for the invention of the telephone. Bell used the money to establish a trust fund, the Volta Fund, and founded the Volta Laboratory Association, along with his cousin Chichester A. Bell and Sumner Tainter. The Volta Laboratory (also known as the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, the Bell Carriage House and the Bell Laboratory) and the Volta Bureau were created in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., by Alexander Graham Bell.

Alexander Graham Bell honors and tributes include honors bestowed upon him and awards named for him.Alexander Graham Bell received numerous tributes during his life, and new awards were subsequently named for him posthumously.Alexander Graham Bell was born on March 16, 1847. Major awards and tributes Among those tributes:Chief George Henry Martin Johnson (Onwanonsyshon) of the aboriginal Six Nations Mohawk Reserve, near Bell's home in Brantford, Ontario, awarded him the title of Honorary Chief for his work in translating the unwritten Mohawk language into Visible Speech symbols (c. 1870);The National Association of Teachers of the Deaf elects Bell its president (1874);The United States Patent and Trademark Office awarded Bell the master telephone patent, No. 174,465, dated March 7, 1876. It becomes the foundation asset of the Bell Telephone Company, which later evolved into AT&T, at times the world's largest telephone company. The patent is considered by many to be the most valuable ever issued in history (1876);The U.S. Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in June 1876,  made Bell's newly created telephone a featured headline worldwide just a few months after it had been patented.  Among the exhibition's judges were the notable Emperor Dom Pedro II of the Empire of Brazil and the eminent British physicist William Thomson (later made Lord Kelvin). Upon hearing Bell's voice through the telephone's receiver, the emperor reputedly exclaimed: \"My God! It talks!\" Thomson described the telephone as \"the greatest by far of all the marvels of the electric telegraph\". Thomson and Emperor Pedro, who was equally amazed that the telephone could 'speak' in Portuguese, later recommended the device to the Committee of Electrical Awards, which voted Bell its Gold Medal for Electrical Equipment. Bell also won a second Gold Medal for his additional display of Visible Speech at the exposition, and further won an order of 100 telephones from Emperor Pedro for his country. Ironically, Bell—then occupied full-time as both a private teacher and as a professor at Boston University—hadn't planned on attending the exhibition due to his heavy work schedule, and left Boston only at the last moment to attend the exposition at the stern insistence of his then-fiance and future wife Mabel Hubbard, aged 18. The Story of Alexander Graham Bell is a somewhat fictionalized 1939 biographical film of the famous inventor. It was filmed in black-and-white and released by Twentieth Century-Fox. The film stars Don Ameche as Bell and Loretta Young as Mabel, his wife, who contracted scarlet fever at an early age and became deaf.The first half of the film concentrates on the hero's romantic, financial, and scientific struggle.Henry Fonda is notable in a co-starring role as Mr. Watson, who hears the first words ever spoken over the telephone. In a pivotal scene, Bell (Don Ameche), while working on the telephone, accidentally spills acid onto his lap and shouts in pain, “Mr. Watson, come here! I want you!” Watson, barely able to contain his own excitement, rushes into the room and stammers out the news that he heard Bell calling out to him over the telephone receiver.  Bell has Watson repeat his own words to him to confirm it, and the two men begin hopping around the room, with Watson yelling out a war whoop.The last part depicts the legal struggle against Western Union over patent priority in the invention of the telephone, ending with a courtroom victory. The final scene has the hero contemplating crewed flight, under his wife's adoring gaze.The film led to the use of the word \"ameche\" as juvenile slang for a telephone, as noted by Mike Kilen in the Iowa City Gazette: \"The film prompted a generation to call people to the telephone with the phrase: 'You're wanted on the Ameche.'\" Such an identity between Ameche and the telephone was forged, that in the 1940 film Go West, Groucho Marx proclaims, \"Telephone? This is 1870, Don Ameche hasn't invented the telephone yet.\" Plot The film opens on a get-together, when a conversation arises about the main character, Alexander Graham Bell. The conversation is quite critical of Bell, with the general consensus being that he was a fool. When Bell enters, the partygoers treat his intelligence and his demonstration of how sound works as an amusing party trick.Bell is given the prospect of helping Gardiner Hubbard's deaf daughter with speech after showing Hubbard his capabilities of teaching a deaf child to communicate using a glove with letters on it. It's an offer Bell accepts. Bryan Davis (born 1981 in Monterey, California) is an American inventor and distiller.  He is most noteworthy for inventing and patenting the first process documented to successfully replicate some of the effects of barrel ageing of distilled spirits in a laboratory (the Davis method).  He is the founder of Lost Spirits an award-winning distilled spirits manufacturing company which uses the technology to manufacture its products as well as license the technology to third parties.

The Holt Manufacturing Company traces its roots to the 1883 founding of Stockton Wheel Service in Stockton, California, United States.  Benjamin Holt, who was later credited with patenting the first workable crawler tractor design, incorporated the Holt Manufacturing Company in 1892.  Holt Manufacturing Company was the first company to successfully manufacture a continuous track tractor.  By the start of the 20th century, Holt Manufacturing Company was the leading manufacturer of combine harvesters in the United States and the leading California-based manufacturer of steam traction engines. The photophone is a telecommunications device that allows transmission of speech on a beam of light.  It was invented jointly by Alexander Graham Bell and his assistant Charles Sumner Tainter on February 19, 1880, at Bell's laboratory at 1325 L Street in Washington, D.C. Both were later to become full associates in the Volta Laboratory Association, created and financed by Bell. Alexander Graham Bell (March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922) was a Scottish-born scientist, inventor, engineer, and innovator who is credited with patenting the first practical telephone and founding the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1885. Alexander Graham Bell (, born Alexander Bell; March 3, 1847 – August 2, 1922) was a  Scottish-born Canadian-American inventor, scientist and engineer who is credited with patenting the first practical telephone. He also co-founded the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1885. Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf; profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone, on March 7, 1876. Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study. Many other inventions marked Bell's later life, including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, and aeronautics. Bell also had a strong influence on the National Geographic Society and its magazine while serving as the second president from January 7, 1898, until 1903. Beyond his work in engineering, Bell had a deep interest in the emerging science of heredity. His work in this area has been called \"the soundest, and most useful study of human heredity proposed in nineteenth-century America... Bell's most notable contribution to basic science, as distinct from invention.\"    Early life  Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on March 3, 1847. The family home was at South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription marking it as Bell's birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell (1845–1870) and Edward Charles Bell (1848–1867), both of whom would die of tuberculosis. His father was Alexander Melville Bell, a phonetician, and his mother was Eliza Grace Bell (née Symonds). Born as just \"Alexander Bell\", at age 10 he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers. For his 11th birthday, his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the name \"Graham\", chosen out of respect for Alexander Graham, a Canadian being treated by his father who had become a family friend.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: What year was the Disney movie starring Telly Blackwood released?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nKéllé Bryan (born 12 March 1975) is an English singer and actress, known as a member of girl group Eternal. In 2018, she began portraying the role of Martine Deveraux in the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, a role she played until 2022. She is also part of the Loose Women panel. Early life Bryan was born on 12 March 1975 in Plaistow, Greater London. Aged 11, Bryan joined the Italia Conti Academy stage school, where she completed eight years of performing arts and qualified as a dance teacher. While at the school, she met Louise Nurding – the pair met executive record producer Denis Ingoldsby, who was forming a girl group. According to Louise, Eternal was initially planned as a trio consisting of her and the Bennett sisters. But then it was proposed that it could be a quartet, so Louise suggested her best friend Kéllé. Career Bryan appeared in ITV's The Bill, and on 31 March 1992 she appeared as Debbie in BBC's EastEnders who was a college friend of Lloyd Tavernier (Garey Bridges).In 1993, Bryan and Nurding, together with sisters Easther and Vernie Bennett formed the 1990s British R&B girl group Eternal. Eternal sold millions of albums, including 16 consecutive top 15 UK chart singles such as \"Stay\", \"Just a Step from Heaven\", \"Oh Baby I\", \"Power of a Woman\", \"I Am Blessed\", \"Someday\", \"Don't You Love Me\", \"I Wanna Be the Only One\" and \"Angel of Mine\". According to Bryan, without Louise Nurding, who left before the start of the recording sessions for the second album, she was \"frozen out\" by the Bennett sisters and was eventually fired by their solicitor.Following her departure from Eternal, Bryan signed a record deal with Mercury Records and began work on her debut solo album, Breakfast in Bed, which would never be released. Her debut single, \"Higher than Heaven\", was dropped in the UK on 20 September 1999 and debuted at number 14 on the national chart. Kojak is an American television series starring Ving Rhames.  It aired on the USA Network cable channel and on ITV4 in the United Kingdom.  It was a remake of Kojak starring Telly Savalas. Under Wraps is a 1997 American television comedy film directed by Greg Beeman and starring Bill Fagerbakke (in a dual role), Adam Wylie, Mario Yedidia, and Clara Bryant, and the first Disney Channel Original Movie (DCOM) by Disney Channel. This television film was shot in Chico, California. It was included by the network in its 100 DCOMs celebration from May–June 2016. Plot Marshall (Mario Yedidia) is a monster movie-obsessed preteen, and he's not crazy about his divorced mom's boyfriend Ted (Bill Fagerbakke), because he misses his dad. His friends Amy (Clara Bryant) and Gilbert (Adam Wylie) aren't as enthusiastic about his interest, but the three friends are still very close. They discover an Egyptian mummy (also played by Bill Fagerbakke) in the basement of a \"dead\" man's house. Because of an ancient amulet and the moonlight being in the right place at the right time, the mummy rises from the dead. The kids are initially afraid, but with time they discover he means them no harm; he's simply clumsy and confused. Marshall in particular bonds with the mummy, naming him \"Harold\" (explaining that the mummy reminds him of his Uncle Harold). The group decides they need to hide Harold, and attempt to find a way to help him now that they are becoming friends. After paying a visit to Bruce, a local shop owner who has a vast collection of monster-related items and knowledge of mythological/supernatural facts, they discover that if the mummy is not put back in his sarcophagus before midnight on Halloween, the mummy will cease to exist.However, the sarcophagus is in the hands of the \"dead\" man, known as Mr. Kubat, who feigned his death to avoid paying his taxes. He's also involved with several illegal schemes, some involving ancient Egyptian artifacts- which is why he had a mummy hidden in his basement. Upon finding out that the mummy has \"escaped\" from the coffin, he orders his henchmen to look for it and bring it back in time, as he is selling it to an interested buyer. The children now have to keep Harold safe from attracting attention of local people in town, as well as protect him from the henchmen. The ninth wave of the \"Walt Disney Treasures\" series of DVDs was released on November 3, 2009.  This wave comprises two releases, each containing one season of the 1957–1959 \"Zorro\" TV series.  Note that these episodes were previously released exclusively through the Disney Movie Club, but those releases were colorized whereas these releases are the original black-and-white format.  Each release also includes two of the four hour-long \"Zorro\" episodes originally aired on \"Walt Disney Presents\" in 1960 and 1961.  This wave is the first wave to not include any animated sets, and the last wave that has been released to date.  Despite being the last wave, this was the only wave to feature standard size DVD cases, while the tin size remained the same.  For the first time also, the tins were colored black, and was the second time featuring another colored tin since \"\".  This wave also brought back the side straps, now colored yellow instead of blue.  This was also the first wave where no original animated set came out.  It was speculated on Disney fan forums that animated set would contain animated left overs from Disney era, including animated shorts not released on previous sets, including the Chip'n'Dale solo cartoons, and Educational shorts form mid-1960s, as well as the animated episodes from the anthology series some of them hosted by Ludwig Von Drake.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Arrhenius equation was proposed by this  Nobel-Prize winning Swedish scientist who is one of the founders of the science of what?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nIn chemical kinetics, the entropy of activation of a reaction is one of the two parameters (along with the \"enthalpy of activation\") which are typically obtained from the temperature dependence of a reaction rate constant, when these data are analyzed using the Eyring equation.  The standard entropy of activation is symbolized ΔS and equals the change in entropy when the reactants change from their initial state to the activated complex or transition state (Δ = change, S = entropy, ‡ = activation).  It determines the preexponential factor A of the Arrhenius equation for temperature dependence of reaction rates.  The relationship depends on the molecularity of the reaction: for reactions in solution and unimolecular gas reactions A = (ekT/h) exp(ΔS/R), while for bimolecular gas reactions A = (ekT/h) (R'T/p) exp(ΔS/R).  In these equations e is the base of natural logarithms, h is the Planck constant, k is the Boltzmann constant and T the absolute temperature.  R' is the ideal gas constant in units of (bar*L)/(mol*K).  The factor is needed because of the pressure dependence of the reaction rate.  R' = 8.3145 * 10^-2 (bar*L)/(mol*K). 3581 Alvarez (1985 HC) is a Mars-crossing asteroid discovered on April 23, 1985, by Shoemaker, C. and Shoemaker, E. at Palomar.  Based upon lightcurve data, it has a synodic rotation period of  hours with an amplitude variation of in magnitude.  With a diameter of ~14 km, it is one of the largest Mars-crossing asteroids.  However, due to the high inclination of its orbit, it never actually passes through the orbit of Mars since at perihelion it is well away from the plane of Mars' orbit.  The asteroid is named after planetary scientist Walter Alvarez and his Nobel-prize winning father, physicist Luis Alvarez. Svante August Arrhenius (19 February 1859 – 2 October 1927) was a Nobel-Prize winning Swedish scientist, originally a physicist, but often referred to as a chemist, and one of the founders of the science of physical chemistry.  He received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903, becoming the first Swedish Nobel laureate, and in 1905 became director of the Nobel Institute where he remained until his death.  His lasting contributions to science are exemplified and memorialized by the Arrhenius equation, Arrhenius definition of an acid, lunar crater Arrhenius, the mountain of Arrheniusfjellet and the Arrhenius Labs at Stockholm University, all named after him.  He was the first to use basic principles of physical chemistry to calculate estimates of the extent to which increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide increase Earth's surface temperature through the Arrhenius effect, leading David Keeling to conclude that human-caused carbon dioxide emissions are large enough to cause global warming. Svante August Arrhenius ( ə-REE-nee-əs, -⁠RAY-, Swedish: [ˈsvânːtɛ aˈrěːnɪɵs]; 19 February 1859 – 2 October 1927) was a Swedish scientist. Originally a physicist, but often referred to as a chemist, Arrhenius was one of the founders of the science of physical chemistry. He received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903, becoming the first Swedish Nobel laureate. In 1905, he became the director of the Nobel Institute, where he remained until his death. Arrhenius was the first to use the principles of physical chemistry to estimate the extent to which increases in the atmospheric carbon dioxide are responsible for the Earth's increasing surface temperature. His work played an important role in the emergence of modern climate science. In the 1960s, Charles David Keeling reliably measured the level of carbon dioxide present in the air showing it was increasing and that, according to the greenhouse hypothesis, it was sufficient to cause significant global warming. The Arrhenius equation, Arrhenius acid, Arrhenius base, lunar crater Arrhenius, Martian crater Arrhenius, the mountain of Arrheniusfjellet, and the Arrhenius Labs at Stockholm University were so named to commemorate his contributions to science.    Biography     Early years  Arrhenius was born on 19 February 1859 at Vik (also spelled Wik or Wijk), near Uppsala, Kingdom of Sweden, the son of Svante Gustav and Carolina Thunberg Arrhenius, who were Lutheran. His father had been a land surveyor for Uppsala University, moving up to a supervisory position. At the age of three, Arrhenius taught himself to read without the encouragement of his parents and, by watching his father's addition of numbers in his account books, became an arithmetical prodigy.

His father had been a land surveyor for Uppsala University, moving up to a supervisory position. The effective diffusion coefficient (also referred to as the apparent diffusion coefficient) of a diffusant in atomic diffusion of solid polycrystalline materials like metal alloys is often represented as a weighted average of the grain boundary diffusion coefficient and the lattice diffusion coefficient.  Diffusion along both the grain boundary and in the lattice may be modeled with an Arrhenius equation.  The ratio of the grain boundary diffusion activation energy over the lattice diffusion activation energy is usually 0.4 - 0.6, so as temperature is lowered, the grain boundary diffusion component increases.  Increasing temperature often allows for increased grain size, and the lattice diffusion component increases with increasing temperature, so often at 0.8T (of an alloy), the grain boundary component can be neglected. The Eyring equation (occasionally also known as Eyring–Polanyi equation) is an equation used in chemical kinetics to describe the variance of the rate of a chemical reaction with temperature.  It was developed almost simultaneously in 1935 by Henry Eyring, Meredith Gwynne Evans and Michael Polanyi.  This equation follows from the transition state theory (a.k.a. activated-complex theory) and is trivially equivalent to the empirical Arrhenius equation which are both readily derived from statistical thermodynamics in the kinetic theory of gases. Photonic curing is the high-temperature thermal processing of a thin film using pulsed light from a flashlamp.  When this transient processing is done on a low-temperature substrate such as plastic or paper, it is possible to attain a significantly higher temperature than the substrate can ordinarily withstand under an equilibrium heating source such as an oven.  Since the rate of most thermal curing processes (drying, sintering, reacting, annealing, etc.) generally increase exponentially with temperature (i.e. they obey the Arrhenius equation), this process allows materials to be cured much more rapidly than with an oven. In chemical kinetics, the pre-exponential factor or A factor is the pre-exponential constant in the Arrhenius equation, an empirical relationship between temperature and rate coefficient.  It is usually designated by A when determined from experiment, while Z is usually left for collision frequency.

The equation was proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1889, based on the work of Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff who had noted in 1884 that Van 't Hoff's equation for the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions.  This equation has a vast and important application in determining rate of chemical reactions and for calculation of energy of activation.  Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula.  Currently, it is best seen as an empirical relationship.  It can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients, population of crystal vacancies, creep rates, and many other thermally-induced processes/reactions.

It is also called \"Néel-Arrhenius theory\", after the Arrhenius equation, and \"Néel-Brown theory\" after a more rigorous derivation by William Fuller Brown, Jr. Néel used his theory to develop a model of thermoremanent magnetization in single-domain ferromagnetic minerals that explained how these minerals could reliably record the geomagnetic field.  He also modeled frequency-dependent susceptibility and alternating field demagnetization. Lattice diffusion (also called bulk or volume diffusion) refers to atomic diffusion within a crystalline lattice.  Diffusion within the crystal lattice occurs by either interstitial or substitutional mechanisms and is referred to as lattice diffusion.  In interstitial lattice diffusion, a diffusant (such as C in an iron alloy), will diffuse in between the lattice structure of another crystalline element.  In substitutional lattice diffusion (self-diffusion for example), the atom can only move by substituting place with another atom.  Substitutional lattice diffusion is often contingent upon the availability of point vacancies throughout the crystal lattice.  Diffusing particles migrate from point vacancy to point vacancy by the rapid, essentially random jumping about (jump diffusion).  Since the prevalence of point vacancies increases in accordance with the Arrhenius equation, the rate of crystal solid state diffusion increases with temperature.  For a single atom in a defect-free crystal, the movement can be described by the \"random walk\" model.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

The album was funded through PledgeMusic. Black and Blue is a live video by hard rock bands Black Sabbath and Blue Öyster Cult filmed during their 1980 co-headlining tour of the United States, known as the \"Black and Blue Tour\". The film was originally released to theaters in 1981 as a concert film. It was later released on VHS, Betamax and laserdisc video format, but has not been officially released on DVD. Film and video releases In 1980, Black Sabbath co-headlined a number of the U.S. shows on their worldwide \"Heaven & Hell Tour\" with Blue Öyster Cult, at the suggestion of Sandy Pearlman, who was managing both bands at the time. These shows became known as the \"Black and Blue Tour\" and were very well attended, often ranking in Billboard magazine's weekly \"Top Boxoffice\" charts.The two bands' October 17, 1980 performances at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Hempstead, New York were filmed and used as part of the December 6, 1980 episode of Don Kirshner's Rock Concert.  The recorded footage was edited together into the concert film Black and Blue, which was released to theaters in 1981 after the conclusion of the tour. Following its initial release, the film played for some time on the theatrical midnight movie circuit in the United States. In the 1980s, it was released for the home video market in VHS format by Polygram Video in the UK, and by Warner Bros. in US. It was also released in laserdisc format by Polygram in UK and Warner Bros. in Japan. According to Martin Popoff, a Betamax version was also issued.In 2002, a DVD release of the film was announced by Castle Pictures, and was available for pre-order from online merchants. However, the release was postponed several times before finally being cancelled in January 2003.In 2004, a second announcement was made of an upcoming DVD release, this time by Universal Video. However, the release was again postponed and then cancelled at the last minute. A few copies were sold by some record stores in European countries that had received advance shipments before the withdrawal. Since then, there has been no official DVD release of the film, although various bootlegs are available.Several sources, including Castle Pictures, have indicated that the DVD has not been released because Black Sabbath, in particular Tony Iommi, do not want it released. Hide and Seek is the fifth full-length studio album by Canadian electronic rock band The Birthday Massacre. Diamonds is the eighth studio album by the Canadian rock band The Birthday Massacre, released on March 27, 2020. Background and production Diamonds had originally been planned for release in September 2019. In May 2019 the band revealed that the band's vocalist Chibi would be undergoing surgery (condition not stated) but assured it was nothing life-threatening. However, due to the circumstances, the album's release was pushed back.When asked for comments on the album, guitarist Michael Rainbow told Billboard: “There is a little bit of escapism. It’s the same as escaping into a good movie or a book. Part of what we find fun about writing is being more dreamlike and surreal in our approach.\" Release and promotion On January 24, 2020, a lyric video for \"The Sky Will Turn\" was released on Metropolis Record's official YouTube channel.On March 5, 2020, \"The Last Goodbye\" was released on the band's YouTube channel.On March 24, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns occurring worldwide, the band released the entire album early on YouTube for streaming via the Metropolis Record's channel, stating \"with love, from The Birthday Massacre.\"Initially, the band had planned to go on tour during the spring of 2020 to promote the album. However, the tour was postponed to the fall due to complications surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2020, instead of postponing the tour once more, all tour dates were officially canceled.In October 2020, the band launched their Patreon page where fan's could pledge a monthly fee for access to exclusive Q&As with the band, see the making-of their music, livestreams, and previously unreleased material. Reception Diamonds was met with mostly positive reviews.Caleb R. Superstition is the sixth full-length studio album by Canadian electronic rock band The Birthday Massacre, released on November 11, 2014 through Metropolis Records.  The album was funded through PledgeMusic.  To promote the album, a subsequent North America tour and music video for \"Beyond\" followed the album's release. The Birthday Massacre (abbreviated TBM) is a Canadian band, formed in 1999 in London, Ontario, and currently based in Toronto, Ontario.  The current lineup consists of lead vocalist Chibi, rhythm guitarist Rainbow, lead guitarist Falcore, drummer Rhim, keyboardist Owen, and bassist Nate Manor. The Birthday Massacre (abbreviated TBM) is a Canadian rock band, formed in 1999 in London, Ontario, and currently based in Toronto, Ontario. The current lineup consists of lead vocalist Sara 'Chibi' Taylor, rhythm guitarist Michael Rainbow, lead guitarist Michael Falcore, keyboardist Owen Mackinder, drummer Philip Elliott, and bassist Brett Carruthers. When the band formed in 1999, they were known as 'Imagica'. This name was inspired by the 1991 fantasy novel Imajica by Clive Barker. In 2002, they changed the name to The Birthday Massacre after one of their earlier songs in order to avoid confusion with another group. The song The Birthday Massacre was then renamed Happy Birthday. According to their vocalist Chibi: \"it kind of works well for the music that we're making. Sort of contrasty, you know? Birthday, and massacre. Light, and dark. Cute, and evil\". The band has released nine studio albums: Nothing and Nowhere (2002), Violet (2005), Walking with Strangers (2007), Pins and Needles (2010), Hide and Seek (2012), Superstition (2014), Under Your Spell (2017), Diamonds (2020), and Fascination (2022). They also issued the DVD Blue (2005), the live album/DVD Show and Tell (2009), the demo album Imagica, and the EPs Violet (2004), Looking Glass (2008), and Imaginary Monsters (2011).    History     Imagica (1999–2001)  The group originated in London, Ontario, under the name 'Imagica', with members using pseudonyms and nicknames instead of their birth names; the members called themselves Chibi, Owen, and Dan Gilman, respectively. The group's original lineup formed when Michael Rainbow met Sara 'Chibi' Taylor at Fanshawe College, who was studying in the same fine-arts program. Rainbow recruited childhood friend Michael Falcore to join on guitar; they had already been recording music together in high school. Aslan, who was also attending the same college, became roommates with Rainbow and joined on bass.

Unlike their previous single, \"Red Stars\", the \"Looking Glass EP\" is a physical release rather than a digital download available through iTunes. Power Pirate is an Independent electronic rock band formed in Washington, D.C. in the Fall of 2007.  The band consists of singer and guitarist Emily Pakulski, keyboard player Michael Garate, and drummer Annika Monari.  Their electronic rock style has been called \"boundary-shattering\" and \"head-rocking.\"  The group found recognition after being selected as a finalist in NAMM's nationwide SchoolJam USA competition.  They appeared on NBC News to promote their placement, and competed against other finalists at the 2010 NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA The band has been noted for their performances, including those at The Black Cat and Fort Reno summer concert series.  The band employs the Do It Yourself method for all of the band functions including promotion, design, recording, mixing, and mastering. Lost in Blue (known in Japan as Survival Kids: Lost in Blue) is a 2005 survival video game developed and published by Konami for the Nintendo DS. Lost in Blue follows two young teenagers, Keith and Skye, who struggle for survival on a deserted island. The player must learn to use the island's natural resources to create a makeshift home away from home. The sequel, Lost in Blue 2, was released two years later. A third installment of the series, Lost in Blue 3, was released on December 20, 2007 in Japan.Due to an undershipment, the game was difficult to find in the months following its North American release. Gameplay Lost in Blue's gameplay makes extensive use of the system's touchscreen and microphone features. In the fire building sequence, the player must alternate pressing of the L and R buttons in order to build enough friction on the wood, and then blow into the DS's microphone to successfully ignite the fire. If the player later gets a fire maker with bow, he or she can press L or R and it will automatically fill up, allowing the player to blow into the microphone and finishing the fire. The touch screen interface is used for navigating menus, and the island can be explored and interacted with using either the touch screen or the standard control buttons.The game's primary action takes place on the touch screen, while the top screen is used to display Keith and Skye's health, which is categorized by hunger, thirst, stamina, and hit points. If the thirst or energy categories hit zero, the character's hit points will begin to drop. It is also possible for other conditions, such as passing out due to lack of stamina, to occur. The player loses if either Keith or Skye runs out of hit points and dies. Players must multitask in micromanaging both characters' vital statistics while also exploring the island.The game's primary protagonist is Keith, who must lead Skye around the island by hand due to her poor eyesight. Upon completing the game, a \"Skye Mode\" is unlocked which allows the player to play the entire game from Skye's perspective. In this mode, she can freely move about the island without assistance, although she is unable to climb as Keith can, severely limiting her range of travel. Story Lost in Blue is not a linear game in its gameplay and its multiple endings provide a different story nearly every time one plays through it. The discography of The Birthday Massacre consists of nine studio albums, one live album, two video albums, three extended plays, one single and eight music videos.The band's debut studio album, Nothing and Nowhere, was independently recorded and distributed on May 31, 2002 on the band's official website, but was re-released on CD again with new sleeve art in 2004 and re-released again on June 5, 2007 via Metropolis Records. It was recorded and mixed by J. Aslan and Rainbow with album artwork by Jurgen Elas and Simon Bondar. The album contains songs from previous Imagica demos, which would follow a long tradition of the band remixing new versions of old songs.The Birthday Massacre followed up Nothing and Nowhere with a second studio album, titled Violet. It was originally released as an EP on October 25, 2004 and re-released in 2005 as an LP with some added tracks from the debut. The album was mixed by Rainbow, J. Aslan, M. Falcore, George Seara, mastered by Noah Nimitz, and engineered by Brett Carruthers. Walking with Strangers was released as the band's third studio album on September 21, 2007. It was produced and engineered by Dave Ogilvie. The album debuted at number thirty-two on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. \"Red Stars\" was released as the album's lead single on August 21, 2007.Looking Glass was released as an EP on May 6, 2008, containing a music video of the Dan Ouellette-directed video for the title track. The EP peaked at number twenty-four on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart. The Birthday Massacre released Pins and Needles on September 14, 2010. It became their first album to chart on the Billboard 200. It also debuted and peaked at number ninety-six in Germany. The band later released an EP, Imaginary Monsters. The EP includes a music video directed by M. Falcore and Rue Morgue. A fifth studio album, Hide and Seek, followed in 2012, debuting and peaking at number one hundred and thirty-eight on the Billboard 200 and number ninety-four in Germany. In April 2013, a video for \"One Promise\" directed by Michelle Hung Tsz Ching was selected among over one hundred and fifty entries as an official music video for Hide and Seek.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: What American criminal defense attorney defended an American domestic terrorist who killed two people in the southern United States by bombing?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe Centennial Olympic Park bombing was a domestic terrorist pipe bombing attack on Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday, July 27, 1996, during the Summer Olympics. The blast directly killed one person and injured 111 others; another person later died of a heart attack. It was the first of four bombings committed by Eric Rudolph in a terrorism campaign against the U.S. government which he accused of championing \"the ideals of global socialism\" and \"abortion on demand\". Security guard Richard Jewell discovered the bomb before detonation, notified Georgia Bureau of Investigation officers, and began clearing spectators out of the park along with other security guards.After the bombing, Jewell was initially investigated as a suspect by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and news media aggressively focused on him as the presumed culprit when he was actually innocent.  In October 1996, the FBI declared Jewell was no longer a person of interest. Following three more bombings in 1997 and 1998, Rudolph was identified by the FBI as the suspect. In 2003, Rudolph was finally captured and arrested, and in 2005 he agreed to plead guilty to avoid a potential death sentence. Rudolph was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for his crimes. Bombing Centennial Olympic Park was designed as the \"town square\" of the Olympics, and thousands of spectators had gathered for a late concert by the band Jack Mack and the Heart Attack.

Her defense attorneys, David Bruck and Judy Clarke, called expert witnesses to testify that she had mental health issues that impaired her judgment when she committed the crimes.Smith was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.

Russell Jr. who later was revealed to have molested Smith when she was a teenager. Russell was a local businessman who later gained prominence in South Carolina's Republican Party and the Christian Coalition.

For nine days, she made dramatic pleas on national television for their safe return. However, following an intensive investigation and a nationwide search for them, she confessed on November 3, 1994, to letting her car roll into nearby John D. Long Lake, drowning them inside. Her motivation was reportedly to facilitate a relationship with a local wealthy man named Tom Findlay. Prior to the murders he sent Smith a letter ending their relationship and expressing that he did not want children. She said that there was no motive nor did she plan the murders, stating that she was not in a right state of mind.Later revelations indicated that detectives doubted Smith's story from the start and believed that she murdered her sons.

The Otherside Lounge bombing was a domestic terrorist pipe bombing attack that occurred on February 21, 1997, in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. At approximately 9:45 p.m., a bomb exploded at the Otherside Lounge lesbian bar that damaged the building and destroyed several cars in the parking lot. While no one was killed, five people were injured, including one critically injured patron. The bombing had been carried out by Eric Rudolph, a serial bomber who had previously committed the Centennial Olympic Park bombing in 1996 that was responsible for two deaths, and he had targeted the nightclub due to his strong opposition to the gay rights movement. In the aftermath of the bombing, investigators were able to link the bombing to the Centennial Olympic Park bombing and to a nearby bombing of an abortion clinic. Several months later, following a bombing of an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, officials were able to link Rudolph to all four bombings and, following a largescale manhunt, he was arrested in 2003 and sentenced to life in prison in 2005. The nightclub, which had been in operation since 1990, never fully recovered from the incident and closed two years after the bombing. Bombing The Otherside Lounge was a nightclub located on Piedmont Road in northeast Atlanta that catered primarily to lesbians and other LGBT patrons. At approximately 9:45 p.m. on the night of February 21, 1997, a bomb located on the outdoor patio of the nightclub exploded. Initially, several people inside the bar believed that a woman had been shot, but they realized that the event had been an explosion after the woman showed that a nail from the bomb had pierced her arm. While there were no fatalities, several people were injured, with The New York Times reporting that \"at least five people\" had suffered injuries from the blast. At least 100 people were in the nightclub at the time of the incident. The explosion damaged the building and destroyed several cars in the parking lot. Police arrived shortly after the explosion and discovered a second bomb inside a backpack hidden in some bushes in the nightclub's parking lot. The police bomb squad used a robot to detonate this second bomb, which left a crater in the parking lot.

Atop the Western Conference standings for the first time, the Suns had earned a bye in the first round of the playoffs.  The offense was highlighted by balanced attack, with four starters averaging 15 points or more a game, but none greater than 19.  This, despite a trade that meant the departure of four-time All-NBA Paul Westphal, who was swapped for fourth-year All-Star guard Dennis Johnson.  In the conference semifinals, the Suns would meet the Kansas City Kings, a team they had defeated in the first round one season ago but found more difficult to handle this season.  After a 22-point win in game one, the Suns would go on to lose game seven and the series.

It was the first season since 1971–72 without Al McCoy broadcasting any games. He announced his retirement after the 2023 NBA playoffs. It also was the first season the Suns moved their broadcasting services from Bally Sports Arizona (previously named FSN Arizona and Fox Sports Arizona) back in 2003 to local broadcast stations in Arizona owned by Gray Television, branded as Arizona's Family Sports alongside an over-the-top subscription service called \"Suns Live\" that was created by Kiswe. During their first season under this change, the Suns would see a 69% increase in viewership by comparison to the previous season under Bally Sports Arizona. This was the first season since 2018–19 without head coach Monty Williams after a second straight disappointing second-round exit.

With Van Arsdale, the Suns would finish the season going 14–12 in their last 26 games of the regular season.  All Suns home games were played at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The 1973–74 Phoenix Suns season was the sixth for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association.  It was the first of 14 seasons head coach John MacLeod spent with Phoenix.  The season would also be the last for former All-Star forward/center Connie Hawkins, traded to the Los Angeles Lakers after appearing in nine games for the Suns.  Charlie Scott would repeat as an All-Star, but who missed 30 games due to injury despite his NBA career-high 25.4 points a game.

The Phoenix Suns are a professional basketball team based in Phoenix, Arizona, United States. They are members of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Suns began playing in the NBA as an expansion team in the 1968–69 NBA season. In their inaugural season, the Suns posted a win–loss record of 16–66. They participated in the playoffs only once in their first seven seasons.In the 1975–76 season, a rookie Alvan Adams helped the team reach its first NBA Finals, which they lost to the Boston Celtics 4–2. Charles Barkley and Steve Nash won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award while playing for the Suns. Barkley led the Suns to the 1993 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Chicago Bulls. After signing with the Suns in 2004, Nash led the team to three straight division titles, but after reaching the conference finals in 2009–10 the Suns subsequently experienced their worst period of on-court failure, missing the playoffs for ten consecutive seasons until the 2020-21 season (the franchise's previous record playoff drought was five seasons, which happened after the team made the postseason in only their second year of existence during the 1969–70 campaign).Despite their failures in the 2010s, the Suns franchise has the NBA's eighth-best all-time winning percentage, having won nearly 54% of their contests as of the conclusion of the 2022-23 NBA season. In their first forty-three seasons, the Suns made the playoffs 29 times, posted nineteen seasons with fifty or more wins, appeared nine times in the Western Conference finals, and advanced to the NBA Finals three times in 1976, 1993, and 2021. Zoran Dragić (born June 22, 1989) is a Slovenian professional basketball player who plays for Bilbao Basket of the Liga ACB. He also represents the Slovenian national basketball team internationally. Standing at 1.96 m (6 ft 5 in), he plays the shooting guard and small forward positions. He is the younger brother of Goran Dragić. Professional career  Early years In 2004, Dragić joined Ilirija of the Slovenian 1B league for the 2004–05 season. A year afterwards, he joined Janče STZ of the Slovenian D2 league for the 2005–06 season. During 2006, he signed with Geoplin Slovan of the Slovenian League where he went on to play four seasons for them. In 2010, he signed with Krka where he went on to play two seasons for them. Málaga (2012–2014) In July 2012, Dragić joined the Houston Rockets for the 2012 NBA Summer League. On August 20, 2012, he signed a two-year deal with Unicaja Málaga of the Liga ACB. On July 8, 2014, he signed a two-year contract extension with Unicaja Málaga. However, after agreeing to sign with the Phoenix Suns, Dragić and Málaga agreed to part ways on September 26, 2014. Phoenix Suns (2014–2015) On September 29, 2014, Dragić signed a two-year deal with the Phoenix Suns. He went on to make his NBA debut on November 15, 2014, against the Los Angeles Clippers. He and Goran, alongside teammates Markieff and Marcus Morris, all briefly played together for the Suns during the fourth quarter of their 112–96 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on January 2, 2015. It marked the first time in the NBA's history that two different pairs of brothers played together for the same team at the same time. The 1975–76 Phoenix Suns season was the eighth season for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association.  The season included an improbable run to the NBA Finals by a team that had never won a playoff series and made the playoffs only one other season in the franchise's existence.  With a regular season record of 42–40, the Suns had finished third in the Pacific division standings and improved upon last season's win total by 10 games.  The ensuing playoff run took plenty by surprise, including a seven-game series win against the Western Conference's top seed Golden State Warriors, a team that had finished 17 games ahead of the Suns in the divisional standings.  The franchise's first Finals appearance pitted them against a 12-time champion in the Boston Celtics, whose roster featured three players from that season's All-Star Game.  The 1976 NBA Finals would feature a memorable Game 5 triple-overtime thriller filled with controversies in which the Suns narrowly lost.  Returning home for Game 6, the demoralized Suns would lose Game 6 and the series but not before endearing a generation of fans to the Suns franchise and showcasing a basketball from the desert southwest.  The team's \"Cinderella\" season earned them the nickname Sunderella Suns.  John MacLeod was head coach and the Suns played their home games at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The 1979–80 Phoenix Suns season was the 12th season for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association and at 55–27, the team's best regular season record since the franchise's inception.  The Suns defeated Western Conference foe Kansas City in the opening round of the playoffs, marking the first time the Suns had won a playoff series in back-to-back seasons.  In the Western Conference Semifinals, the Suns would lose to the Pacific-winning Los Angeles Lakers, who later went on to win the season's championship.  The Suns were led by head coach John MacLeod, his seventh season with the team, and played all home games in Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The 2008–09 Phoenix Suns season was the 41st season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The season was to be a promising one, filled with All-Star talent at several positions.  It was believed over the offseason, the Suns would be able to better incorporate Shaquille O'Neal, who necessitated changes to both the offense and defense after being obtained in a trade one season ago.  It was also the first season head coach Terry Porter had been able to use the summer to implement his defensive approach for a team which had in seasons past scored a large number of their points off fast breaks and early in the shot clock.  Sensing a need for change, team management traded for scorer Jason Richardson in December, but this did not appear to immediately reinvigorate an offense that had recently led the league in points per game.  However, after Phoenix went 28–23 to start the season, Suns assistant Alvin Gentry was named to replace Porter as head coach.  Less than one week after the All-Star Game, Amar'e Stoudemire sustained a season-ending eye injury while the improvement of the team never fully came.  The Suns finished 46–36, second in the Pacific division but out the playoffs for the first time since Steve Nash rejoined the Suns in the 2004–05 season. The 1988–89 Phoenix Suns season was the 20th season for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association.  Cotton Fitzsimmons, Suns head coach for the '70–'71 and '71–'72 seasons, returned to the franchise where he got his first head coaching position.  The Suns also enjoyed the benefits of a trade which brought Tom Chambers to the Valley of the Sun, who would have an All-Star season his first year in Phoenix.  The Suns' regular seasons successes were carried on through the playoffs, sweeping Denver in the first round and defeating Golden State four games to one in the Western Conference Semifinals.  The Suns saw their playoff fortunes reverse in the Conference Finals when they met the season's MVP Magic Johnson and the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers, getting swept four games to zero.  All home games were played at Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Robert Lincoln Patterson served during World War I in a branch of the Armed Forces that dates its institutional inception to what year?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nGeneral of the Army (abbreviated as GA) is a five-star general officer rank in the United States Army. It is generally equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in other countries. In the United States, a General of the Army ranks above generals and is equivalent to a fleet admiral and a general of the Air Force. The General of the Army insignia consisted of five 3⁄8-inch (9.5 mm) stars in a pentagonal pattern, with touching points. The insignia was paired with the gold and enameled United States coat of arms on service coat shoulder loops. The silver colored five-star chain has major insignia alone would be worn for use as a collar insignia of grade and on the garrison cap. Soft shoulder epaulets with five 7⁄16-inch (11 mm) stars in silver thread and gold-threaded United States coat of arms on green cloth were worn with shirts and sweaters.The rank of \"General of the Army\" (the highest rank in the army) has had two incarnations. The first was introduced in 1866, following the American Civil War. While it was nominally a four-star rank, structurally it had authority over the entire Army, it was reserved for the Commanding General of the United States Army, and was held by three different men in succession from 1866 to 1888: Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan. When it was created by Congress for Grant, Grant had already reached the highest rank historically used in the United States, the three star lieutenant general. The \"General of the Army\" rank was revived during World War II as the modern five-star rank. The rank does not imply command of the entire Army and may be awarded to more than one officer at a time. It has been held by five different men since 1944, four promoted to the rank in December 1944 (George C. Marshall, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Henry H. Arnold), and one promoted in September 1950 (Omar Bradley).A special rank of General of the Armies, which ranks above the second incarnation of General of the Army, exists but has been conferred only three times — to World War I's John J. Pershing in 1919, and posthumously to George Washington in 1976. In December 2022, the James M. The United States Department of the Army (DA) is one of the three military departments within the Department of Defense of the U.S. The Department of the Army is the federal government agency within which the United States Army (U.S.) is organized, and it is led by the secretary of the Army, who has statutory authority under 10 United States Code § 7013 to conduct its affairs and to prescribe regulations for its government, subject to the limits of the law, and the directions of the secretary of defense and the president.The secretary of the army is a civilian official appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The highest-ranking military officer in the department is the chief of staff of the Army, who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Other senior officials of the department are the under secretary of the Army (principal deputy to the secretary) and the vice chief of staff of the Army (principal deputy to the chief of staff.)The Department of War was originally formed in 1789 as an Executive Department of the United States and was split by the National Security Act of 1947 into the Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force on September 18, 1947. By amendments to the National Security Act of 1947 in 1949, the department of the Army was transformed to its present-day status. Organizational structure The Department of the Army is a Military Department within the United States Department of Defense. The department is headed by the secretary of the army, who by statute must be a civilian, appointed by the president with the confirmation by the United States Senate. The secretary of the Army is responsible for and has the authority to conduct all the affairs of the Department of the Army, subject to the authority, direction and control of the secretary of defense. The Department of the Army is divided between its headquarters at the seat of government and the field organizations of the Army.By direction of the secretary of defense, the secretary of the Army assigns Army forces, apart from those units performing duties enumerated in 10 United States Code § 7013 (i.e., organize, train & equip) or unless otherwise directed to the operational command of the commanders of the Combatant Commands. The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations.  It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001.  As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783)—before the United States of America was established as a country.  After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army.  The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.

After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself a continuation of the Continental Army, and thus considers its institutional inception to be the origin of that armed force in 1775. The U.S. Army is a uniformed service of the United States and is part of the Department of the Army, which is one of the three military departments of the Department of Defense. The U.S. Army is headed by a civilian senior appointed civil servant, the secretary of the Army (SECARMY), and by a chief military officer, the chief of staff of the Army (CSA) who is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

As a branch of the armed forces, the mission of the U.S. Army is \"to fight and win our Nation's wars, by providing prompt, sustained land dominance, across the full range of military operations and the spectrum of conflict, in support of combatant commanders\". The branch participates in conflicts worldwide and is the major ground-based offensive and defensive force of the United States of America.‌    Mission  The United States Army serves as the land-based branch of the U.S. Armed Forces.

The eldest son of President Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln, he was the only one of their four children to outlive both his parents. Robert Lincoln became a business lawyer and company president, and served as both United States Secretary of War (1881–1885) and the U.S. ambassador to Great Britain (1889–1893).Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois, and graduated from Harvard College. He then served on the staff of General Ulysses S. Grant as a captain in the Union Army in the closing days of the American Civil War. After the war was over, he married Mary Eunice Harlan, and they had three children together. Following completion of his law school studies in Chicago, he built a successful law practice, and became wealthy representing corporate clients.Lincoln was often spoken of as a possible candidate for national office, including the presidency, but never took steps to mount a campaign. He served as Secretary of War in the administration of James A. Garfield, continuing under Chester A. Arthur, and as Minister to Great Britain in the Benjamin Harrison administration.Lincoln became general counsel of the Pullman Company, and after founder George Pullman died in 1897, Lincoln assumed the company's presidency. After retiring from this position in 1911, Lincoln served as chairman of the board until 1924. In Lincoln's later years, he resided at homes in Washington, D.C., and Manchester, Vermont; the Manchester home, Hildene, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. In 1922, he took part in the dedication ceremonies for the Lincoln Memorial. Lincoln died at Hildene in July 1926, at age 82, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Early life Robert Todd Lincoln was born in Springfield, Illinois, on August 1, 1843, to Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln. He had three younger brothers, Edward, William, and Tad. By the time Lincoln was born, his father had become a well-known member of the Whig political party and had previously served as a member of the Illinois state legislature for four terms. The Irish in the British Armed Forces refers to the history of Irish people serving in the British Armed Forces (including the British Army, the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and other elements).  Ireland was ruled as part of the United Kingdom from 1800-1922 and during this time in particular many Irishmen fought in the British Army.  Different social classes joined the military for various reasons, including the Anglo-Irish officers who thoroughly identified with the British Empire, while others, typically poorer Irish Catholics did so to feed their families or seeking adventure.  Many Irishmen and members of the Irish diaspora in Britain and also Ulster-Scots served in both World War I and World War II as part of the British forces.  However, especially since the advent of Irish independence and The Troubles, the topic of enlistment in the British forces has been controversial for the Irish at home, but does still occur.  Since partition, Irish citizens have continued to have the right to serve in the British Army.  Since 2007, when troops finally withdrew from the streets of Northern Ireland, the number of Irish citizens joining has increased, reaching its highest levels since World War II. The 17th Parachute Engineer Regiment (French: \"17 Régiment de Génie Parachutiste, 17 RGP\" ) is heir to the traditions of the 17th Colonial Engineer Regiment (French: \", 17RGC\" ) which illustrated itself during World War II.  It is the only airborne engineer unit of the French Army forming the engineering component of the 11th Parachute Brigade and secures all the specific airborne engineering missions relative to para assaulting at the level of deep reconnaissance as well as operations relative to para demining and handling explosives.  The regiment has been present non-stop since 1975 on all theatres of operations (Lebanon, Tchad, New Caledonia, French Guiana, Pakistan, Kurdistan, Kuwait, Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda, Gabon, Mozambique, ex-Yugoslavia, Albania, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Mali and others).  For its various combat operational deployments, the 17 RGP was cited 3 times at the orders of the armed forces, 2 times at the orders of the armed forces corps, and three of its combat companies cited at the orders of the armed forces ( 2nd combat company) in addition to armed forces corps (1st and 3rd combat companies). Hispanic Americans, also referred to as Latinos, served in all elements of the American armed forces in the war.  They fought in every major American battle in the war.  Between 250,000 and 500,000 Hispanic Americans served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II, out of a total of 12,000,000, constituting 2.3% to 4.7% of the U.S. Armed Forces.  The exact number is unknown as, at the time, Hispanics were not tabulated separately, but were generally included in the general white population census count.  Separate statistics were kept for African Americans and Asian Americans.

The modern United States Navy Baseball Club was founded by retired U.S. Navy Commander Terry Allvord in Pensacola, Florida in 1990 before moving to San Diego for the 1993 season.  This program is the leader in armed forces baseball in the modern era.  Allvord went on to establish over 40 single-service armed forces teams in every branch of the military around the globe.  Tryouts are held every year to form the most talented military and first responders team to compete as the U.S. Military All-Stars during the annual \"Red, White and Blue Tour\" The team features active duty, reserve, veterans, Delayed Entry Program and first responders.  The continuation of two wars has limited the availability of armed forces players.  As a result, beginning in 2010, the team will be known as the \"Heroes of the Diamond\" allowing a limited number of former MLB, current professional, summer collegiate and first responders the opportunity to join the tour.  Players interested in the military and willing to support the mission will continue to pay their own expenses while off-duty to compete against the finest professional, independent and summer collegiate programs in the world. The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial and space warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services.  Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the U.S. Armed Forces on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947.  It is the most recent branch of the U.S. Armed Forces to be formed.  The USAF is the largest and one of the most technologically advanced air forces in the world.  The service articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Air Superiority, Space Superiority, Cyberspace Superiority, Command and Control, Global Integrated ISR, Global Precision Attack, Special Operations, Rapid Global Mobility, Personnel Recovery, Agile Combat Support, and Building Partnerships.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When was the album that \"Wildest Dreams\" was on released?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nWildest Dreams Tour is the seventh concert tour by American singer Tina Turner. The tour supported her eighth studio album \"Wildest Dreams\".  The tour is Turner's biggest outing to date, performing over 250 dates in Europe, North America and Australasia—surpassing her Break Every Rule Tour in 1987.  Lasting nearly 16 months, the tour is estimated to have grossed over $100 million.  The tour was sponsored by Hanes, as Turner became the spokesperson for their new hosiery line.  The tour was financially successful, especially in North America.  It is estimated that tour grossed over 20 million dollars with an attendance of over 650,000 spectators. The American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift (born 1989) has written or co-written every song in her eleven-album discography, with the exception of several cover versions and guest features. She has also written standalone singles, songs for film soundtracks, and songs recorded by other artists.Swift signed a publishing contract with Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing to become a professional songwriter in 2005. She signed with Big Machine Records in 2005, and the label released her first six studio albums until the contract expired in 2018. Her early-career songwriting outputs featured collaborations with Liz Rose, who co-wrote with Swift for the albums Taylor Swift (2006), Fearless (2008), and Red (2012). She was the sole writer of the majority of Fearless and Red, and she wrote her third studio album, Speak Now, solely herself. Promoted to country radio, these four albums incorporate mainstream pop and rock elements, with Red further featuring influences of electronic and hip hop. She recalibrated her artistry from country to pop with her fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), which included writing collaborations with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, and Shellback. The three writers-producers worked with Swift again on her sixth studio album, Reputation (2017).Swift signed a new contract with Republic Records in 2018 and has worked with Antonoff on every album she released thereafter. Her first album under Republic, Lover (2019), is a pop album that featured collaborations with Joel Little, Louis Bell, and Frank Dukes. In 2020, Swift signed a new publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group and released two albums, Folklore and Evermore, which incorporated indie folk. Folklore and Evermore contained collaborations with Aaron Dessner, who became a frequent collaborator with Swift in the subsequent albums, Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024), which both had a synth-pop sound. Swift's former boyfriend, the actor Joe Alwyn, co-wrote several songs with her for Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights.Swift's departure from Big Machine resulted in a public dispute over the ownership of her first six albums in 2019, which made Swift re-record them. \"Wildest Dreams\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift for her fifth studio album, \"1989\".

It is the fifth single from her fifth studio album, 1989 (2014). Swift wrote the song with its producers Max Martin and Shellback. \"Wildest Dreams\" has an atmospheric, balladic production incorporating programmed drums, Mellotron-generated and live strings, and synthesizers; the rhythm interpolates Swift's heartbeat.

Set in Africa in the 1950s, it depicts Swift as a classical Hollywood actress who falls in love with her co-star but ends the fling upon completion of their film project. Media publications praised the production as cinematic but accused the video of glorifying colonialism, a claim that Kahn dismissed. Swift included \"Wildest Dreams\" in the set lists for two of her world tours, the 1989 World Tour (2015) and the Eras Tour (2023–2024). Following the dispute regarding the ownership of Swift's master recordings in 2019 and the viral popularity of \"Wildest Dreams\" on the social media site TikTok in 2021, Swift released the re-recorded version \"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)\".

Sur la Mer is the thirteenth album released by The Moody Blues, released in 1988.  It features the hit single \"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\", a sequel to their 1986 hit \"Your Wildest Dreams\".  Much of the music on this album would fit in the \"synthpop\" genre, though it does bear more rock and acoustic influences than its predecessor.

Continuing the country sounds of 1989's \"White Limozeen\", the album featured collaborations with Lorrie Morgan and Ricky Van Shelton; additional supporting vocals were provided by Vince Gill and Emmylou Harris.  Dolly Parton's duet with Shelton, \"Rockin' Years\", topped the country charts, and the follow-up single co-written by Carl Perkins, \"Silver and Gold\", was a #15 country single.  Rounding out the hit singles was the title song \"Eagle When She Flies\", which only reached a #33 peak, despite spending 20 weeks on the Billboard Country Singles chart.

Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, the song is a power ballad combining pop, rock, and country. The production incorporates gentle acoustic guitars and crescendos after each refrain, leading to dynamic electric guitars, a steady drum beat, and a vocal harmony-layered coda. In the lyrics, a narrator is infatuated with someone after meeting them for the first time, and she worries about whether the initial feeling will be reciprocated.Critics generally praised Swift's songwriting on \"Enchanted\" for creating a soaring production and captivating lyrics. The track initially charted in Canada and the United States in 2010, and it additionally charted in various Asia-Pacific territories after going viral on the video-sharing app TikTok in October–November 2021. The song received certifications in Australia, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Swift included \"Enchanted\" on the set lists of the Speak Now World Tour (2011–2012), the 1989 World Tour (2015), and the Eras Tour (2023–2024).After a 2019 dispute over the ownership of Swift's back catalog, she re-recorded the song as \"Enchanted (Taylor's Version)\" and released it as part of her third re-recorded album, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) (2023). Produced by Swift and Christopher Rowe, the re-recorded song peaked within the top 10 on charts in Australia, Ireland, the Philippines, and Singapore. Background and release Taylor Swift released her third studio album, Speak Now, on October 25, 2010. She wrote all 14 album tracks on the standard edition by herself. Swift wrote \"Enchanted\" about a man whom she was infatuated with after meeting him in person in New York City, and how she hoped to continue the relationship. She deliberately used the word \"wonderstruck\" in the lyrics because the subject used it in one of his emails to Swift after they met. In the album booklet, Swift includes the hidden message for the song as \"A-D-A-M\".

All of these albums reached number one in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.Swift's departure from Big Machine resulted in a dispute over the ownership of her first six studio albums in 2019, which prompted her to re-record them. 1989 (Taylor's Version) is the fourth re-recorded album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 27, 2023, by Republic Records. A re-recording of Swift's fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), it is part of her ongoing re-recording projects following the 2019 dispute over the masters of her back catalog.

In the United States, 1989 (Taylor's Version) marked Swift's 13th number-one album on the Billboard 200 and record-extending sixth album to sell over one million first-week copies. Seven of its songs concurrently became top-10 entries on the Billboard Hot 100, with the vault tracks \"Is It Over Now?\", \"Now That We Don't Talk\", and \"'Slut!'\" occupying the top three spots. In 2024, the album placed at number 18 on Apple Music 100 Best Albums. Background Taylor Swift released her fifth studio album, 1989, on October 27, 2014, under Big Machine Records. Inspired by 1980s synth-pop, Swift conceived 1989 to recalibrate her artistry to pop after promoting her first four albums to country radio. The album received generally positive critical reviews and sold over 10 million copies worldwide. 1989 is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift released on October 27, 2014, through Big Machine Records.  Swift began composing the album following release of previous studio effort, \"Red\" (2012).  Over the course of the two-year songwriting period, she collaborated with producers Max Martin and Shellback—Martin served as the album's executive producer alongside Swift.  The album's title was named after the singer's birth year and inspired by the pop music of the 1980s.   \"The Other Side of Life\" is a 1986 single by The Moody Blues.  It was first released in May 1986 as the title track on the album \"The Other Side of Life\".  It was released as a single in August 1986, the second single released from the album, the first being \"Your Wildest Dreams\".  After its release, it became a major success in the United States, making #11 and #18 on the adult contemporary and mainstream rock charts respectively.  It also reached #58 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. 1989 is the fifth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on October 27, 2014, by Big Machine Records. Inspired by 1980s synth-pop, Swift conceived 1989 to recalibrate her artistry to pop after critics disputed her status as a country musician when she released the cross-genre Red (2012) to country radio. She titled 1989 after her birth year as a symbolic artistic rebirth and enlisted Max Martin, who produced Red's electronic-influenced pop tracks, as co-executive producer.Swift recorded 1989 at studios across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden with an ensemble including Martin, Shellback, Jack Antonoff, Ryan Tedder, Nathan Chapman, and Imogen Heap. The synth-pop production is characterized by pulsing synthesizers, programmed drum machines, and processed backing vocals with electronic elements, a stark contrast to the acoustic arrangements of Swift's past albums. The songs expand on Swift's autobiographical songwriting and explore failed romance from a lighthearted perspective.Swift and Big Machine promoted 1989 extensively through tie-ins and media endorsements but withheld the album from free streaming services, which prompted an industry discourse on the impact of streaming. To support the album, Swift embarked on the 1989 World Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2015. Among seven singles released, three peaked atop the US Billboard Hot 100: \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". 1989 spent 11 weeks atop the Billboard 200 and was certified nine-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has sold over 14 million copies worldwide and was certified multi-platinum in many countries.When 1989 was first released, music critics generally complimented its production as catchy; they found an emotional engagement in its songwriting but some felt the synth-pop production eroded Swift's artistic integrity—a criticism that journalists and academics retrospectively regarded as rockist. 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards, and it was listed in all-time album rankings by Rolling Stone and Consequence. Critics and academics have considered 1989 an album that transformed Swift's status to a pop icon and promoted poptimism, but they also highlighted the media scrutiny that ensued.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

The club competes in the Canadian Football League (CFL) as a member of the league's West Division and plays their home games at Commonwealth Stadium. The Elks were founded in 1949 as the Edmonton Eskimos and have won the Grey Cup championship fourteen times (including a three-peat between 1954 and 1956 and an unmatched five consecutive wins between 1978 and 1982), most recently in 2015 and the most of any CFL club based in Western Canada. The team has a rivalry with the Calgary Stampeders and is one of the three community-owned teams in the CFL. The team discontinued using the Eskimos name in 2020, with the new name Elks formally announced on June 1, 2021. Ownership The Edmonton Elks are one of three \"community owned\" teams in the CFL (owned by local shareholders).Edmonton Elks Football Team, Inc., is governed by a ten-member board of directors. The board consists of a chairman, treasurer, secretary, and seven directors. As of 2017, the board of directors included chairman Brad Sparrow, treasurer Janice Agrios, secretary Murray Scambler, directors Douglas Cox, Rob Heron, Ian Murray, Harold Roozen, Marshall Sadd, and Tom Richards. The club's president and CEO was Chris Presson until he was fired on November 22, 2021. History  Football in Edmonton 1895–1939 The Edmonton Rugby Foot-ball Club, unaffiliated with the current team, was an early Canadian football-rugby union team based in Edmonton. The team played its first organized games with the formation of the Alberta Rugby Football League in 1895. In 1908 the name Esquimaux was adopted. In 1910 the club was officially named the Edmonton Eskimos and was briefly called the Edmonton Elks during 1922. (The city was represented by the Edmonton Civics in 1914 and the Edmonton Canucks in 1919.) After appearing in and losing the 9th Grey Cup and 10th Grey Cup games (being the first western teams to play for the Cup) the team folded in 1925, but returned for two seasons beginning 1928, and then folded again. St. Albert (styled Saint Albert from 1905 to 1909) is a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada. The district is one of 87 current districts mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.The riding encompasses the majority, but not all of, the bedroom community of St. Albert. History The St. Albert electoral district was one of the original 25 electoral districts contested in the 1905 Alberta general election upon Alberta joining Confederation in September 1905. The district was carried over from the old St. Albert electoral district which returned a single member to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1891 to 1905. The district stretched from the City of St. Albert west to the British Columbia border. The riding was renamed in 1909 and has shrunk in size many times since, eventually becoming an urban riding.Although the other district that survives from 1905 (Peace River) is a notable bellwether, St. Albert is a notorious swing riding that has been markedly unkind to its incumbent MLAs. New candidates from an incumbent party have only held the district twice after an incumbent MLA left office, and only two MLAs have managed to win a third term. Boundary history Historically, the riding has included the City of St. Albert and rural areas to the north and west. In Alberta's first election in 1905, the riding stretched to the border with British Columbia.As the city grew in population, the riding shrank to include less rural voters. By 1993, the boundaries of the riding matched the city boundaries. From 1997 onwards, the riding has not included all of the city of St. Albert.The 2010 boundary redistribution kept the riding boundaries exactly the same as the 2003 boundary redistribution. The 2017 redistribution saw its boundaries shift slightly to the west. Representation history The electoral district was created in 1905 when the province was founded.

Edmonton is on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region.  The city anchors the north end of what Statistics Canada defines as the \"Calgary–Edmonton Corridor\". Edmonton (  ED-mən-tən) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Alberta. Edmonton is situated on the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region. The city anchors the northern end of what Statistics Canada defines as the \"Calgary–Edmonton Corridor\", a region spanning between Edmonton and the city of Calgary, Alberta's largest city, which includes the many smaller municipalities between the two. As of 2021, Edmonton had a city population of 1,010,899 and a metropolitan population of 1,418,118, making it the fifth-largest city and sixth-largest metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. Edmonton is both the northernmost city and metropolitan area in North America to have a population of over one million. A resident of Edmonton is known as an Edmontonian. Edmonton was first inhabited by First Nations peoples of Algonquian, Athabaskan, and Siouan origin. These peoples and their ancestors inhabited the area of the modern city intermittently beginning at the close of the last glacial period, perhaps as early as 12,000 BC. The city was also a historic site for the Métis, who held many narrow lots along the North Saskatchewan which gave access to resources in the area. By 1882, these lots numbered about 44, after which they were displaced and integrated into the expanding city of Edmonton. Anthony Henday may have been the first European to enter the area of modern-day Edmonton while exploring the prairies of Rupert's Land for the Hudson's Bay Company in the autumn of 1754. By 1795, many trading posts had been established around the present metropolitan area, and by 1801 they had all moved to the current site of the city of Edmonton. \"Fort Edmonton\", as it was known, became the main centre for trade in the area after the 1821 merger of the HBC and the NWC. Edmonton remained sparsely populated until the Canadian acquisition of Rupert's Land in 1870, followed eventually by the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1891, its inauguration as a city in 1904, and its designation as the capital of the new province of Alberta in 1906.

St. Albert is a city in Alberta, Canada, on the Sturgeon River northwest of the City of Edmonton.  It was originally settled as a Métis community, and is now the second-largest city in the Edmonton Capital Region.  St. Albert first received its town status in 1904 and was reached by the Canadian Northern Railway in 1906. St. Albert is a city in Alberta, Canada, located on the Sturgeon River, northwest of the City of Edmonton, the provincial capital. It was originally settled as a Métis community, and is now the second-largest city in the Edmonton Metropolitan Region. St. Albert first received its town status in 1904 and was reached by the Canadian Northern Railway in 1906. Originally separated from Edmonton by several miles of farmland, the 1980s expansion of Edmonton's city limits placed St. Albert immediately adjacent to the larger city on St. Albert's southern and eastern sides.    History   St. Albert was founded in 1861 as a Métis settlement by Father Albert Lacombe, OMI, who built a small chapel, the Father Lacombe Chapel, in the Sturgeon River valley. The chapel still stands to this day on Mission Hill in St. Albert. The original settlement was named Saint Albert by Bishop Alexandre-Antonin Taché, OMI, after Lacombe's name saint, Saint Albert of Louvain. Originally, although Lacombe had intended to found the mission at Lac Ste. Anne, the soil proved infertile, thus he moved the settlement to what would become St. Albert. This location offered several advantages, notably its easy access to supplies of wood and water, in addition to its excellent soil, it being a regular stopping-point for First Nations peoples on their travels, and its proximity to Fort Edmonton, where the priests could purchase necessary supplies and minister to Catholic workers. A few years later, a group of Grey Nuns would follow Lacombe from Lac Ste. Anne. More Métis from Lac Ste. Anne arrived in 1863 and, by December 1864, the population was roughly 300. In 1870, localised outbreaks of smallpox had spread northward into St. Albert, killing 320 of the area's then-900 residents. St. Albert was previously the site of two Indian residential schools as part of the Canadian Residential School System. The St. Albert Indian Residential School (\"Youville\") was located on Mission Hill within the St. Albert city limits and was operated by the Roman Catholic Church from October 22, 1873 to June 30, 1948, after being relocated from the Lac Ste. Anne Mission, the site of its original founding.  The Edmonton Indian Residential School (\"Poundmaker\") was located approximately 6 km east of St. St. Albert is a city in Alberta, Canada, located on the Sturgeon River, northwest of the City of Edmonton, the provincial capital.

The Oilers compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. They play their home games at Rogers Place, which opened in 2016. Kris Knoblauch is the head coach as of November 12, 2023, and Stan Bowman was named general manager on July 24, 2024. The Oilers are one of two NHL franchises based in Alberta, the other being the Calgary Flames. Their proximity has led to a fierce rivalry known as the \"Battle of Alberta\".The Oilers were founded in 1971 by W. D. \"Wild Bill\" Hunter and Dr. Chuck Allard and played its first season in 1972–73 as one of the twelve founding franchises of the major professional World Hockey Association (WHA). They were intended to be one of two WHA Alberta teams along with the Calgary Broncos. However, when the Broncos relocated and became the Cleveland Crusaders before the WHA's first season began, the team was named the Alberta Oilers. They were renamed the Edmonton Oilers the following year and subsequently joined the NHL in 1979 as one of four franchises absorbed through the NHL–WHA merger.After joining the NHL, the Oilers went on to win the Stanley Cup on five occasions: 1983–84, 1984–85, 1986–87, 1987–88 and 1989–90. Along with the Pittsburgh Penguins, they are tied for the most championships won by any team since the NHL–WHA merger, as well as the most won by any team that joined the league in or after 1967. Among all NHL teams, only the Montreal Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup more times since the league's 1967 expansion. The Oilers also won six straight division titles from 1981–82 through 1986–87. Notably, however, the Oilers have not won a division title since 1987, a drought that includes their most recent two Stanley Cup wins and is the longest division title drought in all of the North American major professional sports. For their overall success in the 1980s and early 1990s, the Oilers team of this era has been honoured with dynasty status by the Hockey Hall of Fame.The Oilers began to struggle after coming up short in the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, missing the playoffs for the subsequent ten seasons. Isle Lake is a medium-sized lake in central Alberta.  It is located about 80 km west of the city of Edmonton.  The lake is fed by the Sturgeon River which eventually flows into the North Saskatchewan River.  Isle Lake has been lower than usual because of the lack of inflow the Sturgeon River gave in 2009.  Some fish species that can be found in the lake are Walleye, Northern Pike, Yellow Perch, Lake Whitefish and Burbot.  Some Settlements around the lake area: Alexander Taylor (May 17, 1853 – February 12, 1916) was a Canadian entrepreneur, inventor and politician.  He is credited as being one of the founders of the city of Edmonton.  Taylor was born in on May 17, 1853 in Ottawa, Ontario, and came to Edmonton in 1877.  Shortly after his arrival in Edmonton, Taylor established the first telegraph, telephone, and electricity systems.  Edmonton asked the Bell Telephone Company to provide services in 1883, but were just offered \"a few telephones\" and no telephone exchange at a great cost, Taylor, who, at the time was working for the Dominion Telegraph and Signal Service proposed running a telephone line from his office to St. Albert, which was 14 km away.  He then purchased two telephones made of Spanish mahogany, and asked store owner Henry William McKenney of St. Albert to keep the device in St. Albert.  On January 3, 1885 the two tested the line, the first on Northern Alberta.  In 1891, Taylor co-founded Edmonton's first electric company, the Edmonton Electric Light Company.  Taylor also co-founded Edmonton's first newspaper, the \"Edmonton Bulletin\" with Frank Oliver in 1880.  Taylor also served on the Edmonton Public School Board from 1899 to 1909, and was the chairman of the board in 1907. St. Albert Catholic High School (SACHS) is a high school in St. Albert, Alberta, Canada and is part of Greater St. Albert Catholic Regional Division No. 29.  The school colours are yellow and blue.  SACHS sports teams are the Skyhawks.  SACHS Senior girls basketball program has won back to back 3A provincial championships and is considered one of the premier basketball programs in the province.  Shelby Hucul, a 2011 graduate, was selected top 3A female basketball player in the province and will be playing at the University of Alberta Pandas.  In addition, SACHS is well known for its football program, which continues to send multiple players to post secondary opportunities.  SACHS alumni Tanner Doll won the 104th Grey Cup as a Long Snapper with the Ottawa RedBlacks in 2016 at BMO Field in Toronto. Big Lake is a lake in central Alberta, Canada.  It is located adjacent to the northwest corner of Edmonton and the southwest corner of St. Albert.  Its primary inflow is the Sturgeon River.  The lake sits on the sands and gravels of the Empress Formation, an aquifer 30 m below its surface that was laid down by retreating glacial meltwaters. The Michel Band also called the Michel Caillehoo, Michel Caillehouis, Michel Caillehow, Michel Calahoo, Michel Calistrois, or Michel Calliho Band was a group of \"Indians\" (typically First Nations people]) united in a band government.  The band was a party to Treaty 6 with the Canadian government, having signed an adhesion to it in 1876.  In 1880 - A 40-square mile reserve was surveyed as “Michel I.R. 132\" on the Sturgeon River, about eight miles from the Roman Catholic Mission at St. Albert, 15 miles 5 miles northwest of Edmonton.  Reserve confirmed by Order in Council PC 1151 on May 17, 1889.  Like all First Nations in the Edmonton area, the Michel Band members came under heavy government and settlement pressure to surrender their rich agricultural land.  Land sales marked by government corruption steadily eroded their land base through the next half-century.  In 1958, the Michel Band became the only First Nation in Canada in the twentieth century to enfranchise.  In 1985 many descendants of the historic Michel Band regained Indian Status through Bill C-31.  They have since that time lobbied the federal government to once again recognize them as an Indian band with Aboriginal and treaty rights.

Seasons MenWomen References The Metro Line is a light rail transit line on the Edmonton LRT system, that operates from northwest Edmonton to southwest Edmonton scheduled to have begun operation by early 2014 but instead opened on September 6, 2015, at a reduced speed and frequency.  The line uses 3.3 km of new track, three new stations, and eleven stations on the existing Capital Line.  The cost of the project is $665 million, jointly funded by the City of Edmonton, Province of Alberta, and the Government of Canada.  It is the first new line that is not an extension of the existing line.  The line is expected to add 13,200 riders per weekday.  A trip from NAIT station to Churchill is expected to take nine minutes.  A number of roadworks are under construction or completed to revitalize the surrounding community.  An extension to the northwest city limits has completed conceptual design, and a further extension is proposed through the city of St. Albert on Highway 2/St. Albert Trail.

West Virginia is the 10th-smallest state by area and ranks as the 12th-least populous state, with a population of 1,793,716 residents. The capital and most populous city is Charleston with a population of 49,055. West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863, and was a key border state during the American Civil War. It was the only state to form by separating from a Confederate state, one of two states (along with Nevada) admitted to the Union during the Civil War, and the second state to separate from another state, after Maine separated from Massachusetts in 1820. Some of its residents held slaves, but most were yeoman farmers, and the delegates provided for the gradual abolition of slavery in the new state constitution. The state legislature abolished slavery in the state, and at the same time ratified the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery nationally on February 3, 1865. West Virginia's northern panhandle extends adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio to form a tristate area, with Wheeling, Weirton, and Morgantown just across the border from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Huntington in the southwest is close to Ohio and Kentucky, while Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry in the eastern panhandle region are considered part of the Washington metropolitan area, between Maryland and Virginia. West Virginia is often included in several U.S. geographical regions, including the Mid-Atlantic, the Upland South, and the Southeastern United States. It is the only state entirely within the area served by the Appalachian Regional Commission; the area is commonly defined as \"Appalachia\". The state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills, its historically significant coal mining and logging industries, and its political and labor history. It is also known for its tourism and a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities, including skiing, whitewater rafting, fishing, hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and hunting. From the Great Depression to the 1990s, the state voted heavily for the Democratic Party due to its tradition of union-based politics.

West Virginia University (WVU) is a public land-grant research university with its main campus in Morgantown, West Virginia. Its other campuses are those of the West Virginia University Institute of Technology in Beckley, Potomac State College of West Virginia University in Keyser, and clinical campuses for the university's medical and school at Charleston Area Medical Center in Charleston and the Eastern Division at the WVU Medicine Berkeley and Jefferson Medical Centers. WVU Extension Service provides outreach with offices in all 55 West Virginia counties.Enrollment for the Fall 2021 semester was 25,474 for the main campus, while enrollment across all three non-clinical campuses was 28,267. The Morgantown campus offers more than 350 bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and professional degree programs throughout 13 colleges and schools, including that state's only law and dental schools. Faculty and alumni include 25 Truman Scholars, 47 Goldwater Scholars, 88 Gilman Scholars, 70 Fulbright Scholars, and 25 Rhodes Scholars. History  Establishment Under the terms of the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, the West Virginia Legislature created the Agricultural College of West Virginia on February 7, 1867, and the school officially opened on September 2 of the same year. On December 4, 1868, lawmakers renamed the college West Virginia University to represent a broader range of higher education. It built on the grounds of three former academies, the Monongalia Academy of 1814, the Morgantown Female Academy of 1831, and Woodburn Female Seminary of 1858. Upon its founding, the local newspaper claimed that \"a place more eligible for the quiet and successful pursuit of science and literature is nowhere to be found\".The first campus building was constructed in 1870 as University Hall and was renamed Martin Hall in 1889 in honor of West Virginia University's first president, the Rev. Alexander Martin of Scotland. After a fire destroyed the Woodburn Seminary building in 1873, the centerpiece of what is now Woodburn Hall was completed in 1876, under the name New Hall. The name was changed to University Building in 1878 when the College of Law was founded as the first professional school in the state of West Virginia. The precursor to Woodburn Circle was finished in 1893 when Chitwood Hall (then Science Hall) was constructed on the bluff's north side. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \"LD\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \"Amqui\" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: What does Dunn's Famous Deli and Steakhouse serve is a raw meat is brined, partially dried, seasoned with herbs and spices, then smoked and steamed?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nJerry's Famous Deli is a chain of delicatessens known for its large menu, which has offered as many as 700 items.  The original deli was founded in Studio City, California, in 1978 by Isaac Starkman and Jerry Seidman.  The business now comprises three restaurants in Southern California and closed the one in Miami Beach on July 10, 2014 after almost a 12-year run.  The company has recently invested heavily in their Epicure Market brand by converting Wolfie Cohen's Rascal House into a new upscale Epicure Market and opened a third location in Coral Gables, Florida in 2013.  Rumor has it they are expanding the Epicure Market brand to Southern California where they recently closed four Jerry's Famous Deli restaurants. The Main Deli Steak House, also known simply as Main Deli is a delicatessen and steakhouse located in Montreal, Quebec.  The restaurant was established in 1974 by Peter Varvaro and presently located on Saint-Laurent Boulevard right across the street from their main business rival, the famed Schwartz's Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen.  The two restaurants are often compared against each other in their patronage and the flavours of their Montreal-style smoked meat. Brühwurst (\"scalded sausage\" or \"parboiled sausage\") is the collective name for several types of sausages according to the German classification.  They are a cooked sausage that are scalded (parboiled), as opposed to being raw.  They are typically prepared from raw meat that is finely-chopped, are sometimes smoked, and are typically served hot. Bhutanese cuisine (Dzongkha: འབྲུག་ཟས་; Wylie: \"brug-zas\") employs a lot of red rice (like brown rice in texture, but with a nutty taste, the only variety of rice that grows at high altitudes), buckwheat, and increasingly maize.  Buckwheat is eaten mainly in Bumthang, maize in the Eastern districts, and rice elsewhere.  The diet in the hills also includes chicken, yak meat, dried beef, pork, pork fat, and lamb.  Soups and stews of meat, rice, ferns, lentils, and dried vegetables, spiced with chili peppers and cheese, are a favorite meal during the cold seasons.  \"Zow shungo\" is a rice dish mixed with leftover vegetables. \" Ema datshi\" is a spicy dish made with large, green chili peppers in a cheesy sauce (similar to chili con queso), which might be called the national dish for its ubiquity and the pride that Bhutanese have for it.  Other foods include \"jasha maru\" (a chicken dish), \"phaksha paa\" (dried pork cooked with chili peppers, spices, and vegetables, including turnips, greens, or radishes), \"thukpa\", \"bathup\", and fried rice.  Cheese made from cow's milk called \"datshi\" is never eaten raw, but used to make sauces.  \"Zoedoe\" is another type of cheese made in the Eastern districts, which is added to soups.  Zoedoe is normally greenish in color and has a strong smell.  Other types of cheese include Western types like Cheddar and Gouda.  Western Cheese is made in the Swiss Cheese Factory in Bumthang or imported from India. Smoked meat is the result of a method of preparing red meat, white meat, and seafood which originated in the Paleolithic Era. Smoking adds flavor, improves the appearance of meat through the Maillard reaction, and when combined with curing it preserves the meat. When meat is cured then cold-smoked, the smoke adds phenols and other chemicals that have an antimicrobial effect on the meat. Hot smoking has less impact on preservation and is primarily used for taste and to slow-cook the meat. Interest in barbecue and smoking is on the rise worldwide. Smoking with wood Generally meat is smoked using hardwood or wood pellets made from hardwood; softwood is not recommended due to increased PAH from the resin. Wood smoke adds flavor, aroma, and helps with preservation. There are two types of smoking: cold smoking generally occurs below 90 °F (32 °C) and has more preservative value. Hot smoking generally occurs above 160 °F (71 °C). Most woods are seasoned and not used green. There are many types of wood used for smoking; a partial list includes:Woods with a mild flavor: Alder, apple, apricot, ash, birch, cherry, maple, peach, pear.Woods with a medium flavor: Almond, hickory, pecan, post oak, pasania.Woods with a strong flavor: Acacia, black walnut, chokecherry, grapevine, mesquite.Other woods and organic matter: Avocado, bay, beech, butternut, carrotwood, camphor, castanopsis, chestnut, citrus woods, cottonwood, crabapple, fig, guava, gum, hackberry, kiawe, lilac, madrone, mulberry, olive, peat, plum, persimmon, pimento, tea, and willow. Types  African fish smoking Close to 80% of all fish caught in most African nations is smoked. Traditionally the processing and smoking of fish has been done by women. The primary method of smoking is hot smoking, the flavor from hot smoking preferred by local consumers. Traditional smoking methods include using bamboo racks over smoky fires, mud ovens and placing the fish directly on smoldering woods and grasses. Pastrami (Turkish: \"pastırma\" , Romanian: \"pastramă\", Bulgarian: \"пастърма\") is a meat product usually made from beef, and sometimes from pork, mutton or turkey.  The raw meat is brined, partially dried, seasoned with herbs and spices, then smoked and steamed.  Beef plate is the traditional cut of meat for making pastrami, although it is now common in the United States to see it made from beef brisket, beef round, and turkey.  Like corned beef, pastrami was originally created as a way to preserve meat before refrigeration. Pastrami (Romanian: pastramă) is a type of cured meat originating from Romania usually made from beef brisket. Later recipes use lamb, pork, chicken or turkey. The raw meat is brined, partially dried, seasoned with herbs and spices, then smoked and steamed. Like corned beef, pastrami was originally created as a way to preserve meat before the invention of refrigeration. One of the iconic meats of Eastern European cuisine as well as American Jewish cuisine and New York City cuisine, hot pastrami is typically served at delicatessen restaurants on sandwiches such as the pastrami on rye.    Etymology and origin  The name pastrami comes from the Turkish pastırma, derived from the Turkish and Azerbaijan verb bastırma meaning \"to press\". Wind-dried beef had been made in Anatolia for centuries, and Byzantine dried meat is thought by some to be \"one of the forerunners of the pastırma of modern Turkey.\" Pastrami was introduced to the United States in a wave of Jewish immigration from Bessarabia and Romania in the second half of the 19th century. The modified \"pastrami\" spelling was probably introduced in imitation of the American English salami. Romanian Jews emigrated to New York as early as 1872. Among Jewish Romanians, goose breasts were commonly made into pastrami because they were available. Beef navel was cheaper than goose meat in America, so the Romanian Jews in America adapted their recipe and began to make the cheaper-alternative beef pastrami. New York's Sussman Volk is generally credited with producing the first pastrami sandwich in the United States in 1887. Volk was a kosher butcher and New York immigrant from Lithuania. According to his descendant Patricia Volk, he prepared pastrami according to the recipe of a Romanian friend and served it on sandwiches out of his butcher shop. The sandwich was so popular that Volk converted the butcher shop into a restaurant to sell pastrami sandwiches.    Preparation and serving   Beef plate is the traditional cut of meat for making pastrami, although it is now common in the United States to see it made from beef brisket, beef round, and turkey. New York pastrami is generally made from beef navel, which is the ventral part of the plate.

New York pastrami is generally made from beef navel, which is the ventral part of the plate. It is cured in brine, coated with a mix of spices such as garlic, coriander, black pepper, paprika, cloves, allspice, and mustard seed, and then smoked. Chipped beef is a form of pressed, salted and dried beef that has been sliced into thin pieces .  Some makers smoke the dried beef for more flavor.  The modern product consists of small, thin, flexible leaves of partially dried beef, generally sold compressed together in jars or flat in plastic packets.  The processed meat producer Hormel once described it as \"an air-dried product that is similar to bresaola, but not as tasty.\" Montreal-style smoked meat, Montreal smoked meat or simply smoked meat in Montreal (French: \"smoked meat\"; sometimes \"viande fumée\"), is a type of kosher-style deli meat product made by salting and curing beef brisket with spices.  The brisket is allowed to absorb the flavours over a week, and is then hot smoked to cook through, and finally steamed to completion.

Appearance At about 180 feet (55 m) high and 600 feet (180 m) long, the waterfalls are naturally terraced like giant natural stairs. Several small lagoons are interspersed among the vertical sections of the falls.The falls empty into the Caribbean Sea at the western end of a white-sand beach. Tourism Climbing the waterfalls is a popular tourist activity and is often, but not exclusively, performed with the help of tour guides from the park. It takes about 1-1.5 hours to climb with short breaks for photographs and video recordings taken by the guides. There are also stairs alongside of the falls for those who do not want to get wet or are unable to manage the rocky, uneven terrain of the actual waterfall.The falls are bordered by lush, green vegetation that shades the area from the sun and keeps the area, and climbers, cool. The climb can be relatively hard so is often undertaken as a hand-holding human chain led by a guide to make it easier.In addition to the falls, a park has developed where there is an area for zip-lining, a kids splash pad, and a merchandise area.In 1988 the falls were used as a filming location during the Hollywood movie Cocktail. History The falls were the location where the Battle of Las Chorreras took place in 1657, when the British defeated a Spanish expeditionary force from Cuba. A plaque placed at the bottom of the falls by the Jamaican Historical Society commemorates the event (see photo). Geology Dunn's River, a short stream dropping only 55 metres (180 ft) from its source to the sea, is fed by spring water rich with calcium carbonate and deposits travertine forming a sequence of tufa terraces. Such waterfalls are described by geologists as \"a living phenomenon\" because they are continuously rebuilt by the sediments in spring water.Dunn's River Falls is one of the very few travertine waterfalls in the world that empties directly into the sea. Awards Dunn's River Falls won the Caribbean's Leading Adventure Tourist Attraction in 2023, 2021, and 2020. A jerky gun is a small hand held kitchen appliance that is used to form raw ground meat into thin strips or round sticks.  These thin raw meat strips and sticks are then typically dehydrated into jerky via a food dehydrator or home oven.  The size of the raw meat strips discharged from a jerky gun are typically 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick by up to 1 inch wide while the raw meat sticks are usually 1/2 inch in diameter. Dunn's Famous Deli and Steakhouse is a Montreal-style smoked meat, Pastrami and Cheesecake restaurant chain founded in Montreal, Quebec, Canada by Myer Dunn. Dunn's Famous Deli and Steakhouse is a chain of Jewish delis serving Montreal-style smoked meat, pastrami and cheesecake founded in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, by Myer Dunn. The chain currently has locations in Montreal, and one in Ottawa.    History  Dunn, who immigrated to Canada in 1911, opened his first restaurant in 1927 on Avenue Papineau near Avenue du Mont-Royal. In 1948 he opened his first restaurant to be called \"Dunn's Famous Delicatessen\" at the corner of Avenue du Parc and Avenue du Mont-Royal. In 1955 he opened his flagship restaurant at 892 Saint Catherine Street West. The storefront windows were famous for the top-to-bottom stacks of large jars full of hot banana peppers. The deli was open 24 hours a day, unusual for restaurant in the downtown core. Beginning in the 1970s Dunn's Famous began to focus more on Montreal-style smoked meat, eventually stopping its promotion of Pastrami. The iconic Saint Catherine Street deli closed in 1998, though Dunn's grandson re-opened the establishment in 2000 at a larger space nearby on Metcalfe Street. This move was controversial, as it turned off many loyal customers who preferred the nostalgia of the old location despite the overcrowding. Other longtime deli competitors, Schwartz's and Main Deli, quashed relocation and franchising plans due to the potential backlash of diluting their iconic brands.    Franchising  Ina Devine, daughter of Aideh Dunn, had franchised the restaurant outside Quebec, with several locations in Ontario and one in British Columbia, however, today, only one remains (Dalhousie Street in the Byward Market area of Ottawa). The smoked meat is not prepared in-house at these locations, but it is instead shipped frozen from Montreal and then warmed out before serving.[1] Elliot Kligman currently has five franchises in Quebec and also offers Dunn's brand products to retail sellers.    Quebec language dispute  When the controversial Charter of the French Language (Bill 101) became law in 1977, the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) took action against Dunn's and other stores retailing imported kosher goods that did not meet its labelling requirements, an action perceived in the Jewish community as an unfair targeting and antisemitism.

Qarta is a Kazakh and Kyrgyz cuisine dish of boiled and pan-fried horse rectum, taken from the final few inches of digestive tract before the muscular part of the anus.  It is served without sauce or spices.  The section includes \"strong tissue on the outside\" and \"gradations of tender mucous membrane tissue and fatty mass on the inside\" and includes a layering of soft and hard tissues that dense and varied with fat, according to a reviewer from Vice.com.  It is prepared in various ways to clean it thoroughly and remove any unpleasant taste due to the provenance of the tissue.  One method is to turn it inside out and wash it thoroughly.  It can also be smoked for 24 hours and then (sometimes) dried for an additional 48 hours.  Or it can be boiled for a couple of hours.  It is then sliced into rounds, simmered in a \"meat bullion\" and seasoned with salt, green pepper, and dill.  It is often served with qazy. Pastrami on rye is a sandwich comprising sliced pastrami on rye bread, often served with mustard and Kosher dill pickles. It was popularized in the Jewish delicatessens of New York City and has been described as New York's \"signature sandwich\". It was created in 1888 by the Lithuanian immigrant Sussman Volk, who served it at his deli on Delancey Street in Manhattan. History Sussman Volk emigrated from Lithuania in the late 1800s and opened a small butchershop on New York's Lower East Side. He befriended another immigrant, from Romania, whom he allowed to store meat in his large icebox. In exchange, the friend gave the recipe for pastrami to Volk, who began to serve it to his customers. It proved so popular that, in 1888, Volk opened a delicatessen at 88 Delancey Street, one of the first delis in New York City, where he served the pastrami on rye bread. The pastrami on rye became a favorite at other delis, topped with spicy brown mustard. Delis in New York City, such as Katz's Delicatessen, have become known for their pastrami on rye sandwiches. In her description of the book on Katz's, Florence Fabricant, the food critic for the New York Times, described the volume \"as overstuffed as Katz's pastrami on rye\".The pastrami on rye sandwich is a symbol of the classic New York Jewish deli, featured in delis around the world attempting to recreate the ambience of the original New York delis, in cities such as Los Angeles, Buenos Aires, Boca Raton, Florida, and San Diego, California. The classic, which the Wall Street Journal  called New York's \"signature sandwich\", consists simply of sliced pastrami, placed on rye bread, and topped with spicy brown mustard.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Christopher Taylor White (born 7 March 1943) is an English musician. He came to prominence in the mid-1960s as the bass guitarist and occasional lead vocalist of the rock band The Zombies. White is one of the main composers of the Zombies' music, and made major lyrical contributions to the band's songs. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 as a member of the Zombies.    Early years  White was born on 7 March 1943, in Barnet, Hertfordshire, to Harold White, a bus inspector for London Transport, and his wife Nan. The family soon relocated to Markyate, Hertfordshire, where his parents Harold and Nan White owned the village general store, selling groceries, hardware, paint, and furniture. As a pastime, Harold White played double bass in dance bands performing the music of Glenn Miller and other swing bands; he gave his son his earliest musical training, playing guitar alongside White on the ukulele. There was also a piano in the house. White attended St Albans County Grammar School, Hertfordshire, where he met Colin Blunstone, later meeting Rod Argent, Paul Atkinson, and Hugh Grundy who were at St. Albans School, the musicians who became the Zombies.    The Zombies   White replaced the Zombies' initial bass guitarist, Paul Arnold, and became one of the band's two main songwriters, alongside Rod Argent. He wrote two tracks on their US debut album, The Zombies, released in January 1965. On the UK debut release, Begin Here, he had three tracks. For the Zombies' performances in the 1965 film Bunny Lake Is Missing White wrote \"Nothing's Changed\" and \"Remember You\".  An album, Begin Here (renamed to The Zombies when released in the US) would follow. They would appear on American television for the first time on January 12 1965, when they appeared on the first episode of Hullabaloo. The Zombies would have another chart-topper in 1964 with Tell Her No. The group continued to record successfully through the 1960s, but disbanded in December 1967, reportedly over management disagreements. A second album was released in 1968 titled Odessey and Oracle, which featured the song Time of the Season. Christopher Taylor White (born 7 March 1943) is an English musician.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 as a member of the Zombies.    Early years  White was born on 7 March 1943, in Barnet, Hertfordshire, to Harold White, a bus inspector for London Transport, and his wife Nan. The family soon relocated to Markyate, Hertfordshire, where his parents Harold and Nan White owned the village general store, selling groceries, hardware, paint, and furniture. As a pastime, Harold White played double bass in dance bands performing the music of Glenn Miller and other swing bands; he gave his son his earliest musical training, playing guitar alongside White on the ukulele. There was also a piano in the house. White attended St Albans County Grammar School, Hertfordshire, where he met Colin Blunstone, later meeting Rod Argent, Paul Atkinson, and Hugh Grundy who were at St. Albans School, the musicians who became the Zombies.    The Zombies   White replaced the Zombies' initial bass guitarist, Paul Arnold, and became one of the band's two main songwriters, alongside Rod Argent. He wrote two tracks on their US debut album, The Zombies, released in January 1965. On the UK debut release, Begin Here, he had three tracks. For the Zombies' performances in the 1965 film Bunny Lake Is Missing White wrote \"Nothing's Changed\" and \"Remember You\".  An album, Begin Here (renamed to The Zombies when released in the US) would follow. They would appear on American television for the first time on January 12 1965, when they appeared on the first episode of Hullabaloo. The Zombies would have another chart-topper in 1964 with Tell Her No. The group continued to record successfully through the 1960s, but disbanded in December 1967, reportedly over management disagreements. A second album was released in 1968 titled Odessey and Oracle, which featured the song Time of the Season. Time of the Season is one of the Zombies most successful singles, along with She’s Not There. Motionless in White is an American metalcore band from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Formed in 2004, the band consists of lead vocalist Chris \"Motionless\" Cerulli, guitarists Ryan Sitkowski and Ricky \"Horror\" Olson, drummer Vinny Mauro and bassist Justin Morrow. Cerulli is the only member of the original line-up that remains in the band. The group has stated that their band name derived from the Eighteen Visions song \"Motionless and White\".Motionless in White was signed to Fearless Records for their first three studio albums; their fourth album, Graveyard Shift, was released in May 2017 through Roadrunner Records. Their fifth album, Disguise, was released in June 2019, followed by their sixth album, Scoring the End of the World, in June 2022. History  Formation and early years (2004–2009)  Motionless in White was founded in summer of 2004 by members Chris Motionless, who played guitar and lead vocals, Angelo Parente on drums, Frank Polumbo on guitar and Kyle White on bass during high school. For their first two shows at the Northeast Fair in Pittston, PA, the band was known as \"One Way Ticket\" and then as \"When Breathing Stops\" for the remainder of 2004. On New Year's Day of 2005, they settled on their current name. Chris Motionless and other members have noted bands such as Poison the Well, Slipknot, Marilyn Manson, Johnny Cash, Depeche Mode, and other musical groups as their inspiration. In 2005, they released their self-distributed demo.Within the year after the release of their demo, new member Josh Balz was added as the band's keyboardist, Frank Polumbo took over on bass and new members, Michael Costanza and Thomas \"TJ\" Bell, were added to the band as the new guitarists, moving Chris Motionless solely to lead vocals. The band was discovered by Zach Neil while performing at a local nightclub called The Staircase. Neil signed the band first to management and then later to his record label Masquerade recordings. Colin Edward Michael Blunstone (born 24 June 1945) is an English singer and songwriter. In a career spanning more than 60 years, Blunstone came to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the rock band the Zombies, which released four singles that entered the Top 75 charts in the United States during the 1960s: \"She's Not There\", \"Tell Her No\", \"She's Coming Home\" and \"Time of the Season\". Blunstone began his solo career in 1969, releasing three singles under a pseudonym of Neil MacArthur. Since then, he has released ten studio albums under his real name. He was also a recurring guest vocalist with the Alan Parsons Project, appearing on four of their albums between 1978 and 1985.In 2019, Blunstone was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of The Zombies. Early years Colin Edward Michael Blunstone was born on 24 June 1945, in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, only son of Arthur Blunstone, an aeronautical engineer at the De Havilland factory at Hatfield who later ran a hairdressing business before returning to work for De Havilland, and housewife Dorothy, a former dancer who also worked for De Havilland. Notwithstanding post-war privations, Blunstone recalled that although his family were not well-off, his parents never owning a car, they had a pleasant lifestyle in rural Hertfordshire. He noted that \"as a band we gave off that aura of being middle-class... maybe a couple of the guys' families were comfortable, but the others' weren't. Because of where we came from we talk in a particular way. That... sounded a bit like BBC accents... My parents weren't wealthy at all. We may have been middle-class by aspiration, but not by income.\" He attended St Albans County Grammar School for Boys. The Zombies Rod Argent, Paul Atkinson, and Hugh Grundy first played together at a jam on Easter 1961 in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Rod Argent wanted to form a band and initially asked his cousin Jim Rodford to join as a bass guitarist. Rodford was playing in local band called the Bluetones at the time, so declined. Juan Fernando Silvetti Adorno (27 March 1944 – 5 July 2003), professionally known as Bebu Silvetti or simply Silvetti, was an Argentine-born Mexican pianist, composer, conductor, arranger, and record producer.  In the 1970s he moved to Mexico and got the nationality.  Popularly known for the 1977 instrumental disco hit, \"Lluvia De Primavera\" (\"Spring Rain\" in English), the album was produced in Mexico and for the 1980 modern instrumental mariachi album.  Silvetti was also a successful, Grammy-winning producer for a wide variety of Latin and international music performers.  He was the father of the actress Anna Silvetti.  Silvetti also worked in the music of successful films and telenovelas in Mexico. Titta Ruffo (9 June 1877 - 5 July 1953), born as Ruffo Titta Cafiero, was an Italian operatic baritone who had a major international singing career.  Known as the \"Voce del leone\" (\"voice of the lion\"), he was greatly admired, even by rival baritones, such as Giuseppe De Luca, who said of Ruffo: \"His was not a voice, it was a miracle\" (although not often published is the second part of De Luca's conclusion \"...which he [Ruffo] bawled away...\"), and Victor Maurel, the creator of Verdi's Iago and Falstaff.  Maurel said that the notes of Ruffo's upper register were the most glorious baritone sounds he had ever heard (see Pleasants, cited below).  Indeed Walter Legge, the prominent classical record producer, went so far as to call Ruffo \"a genius\". In the mathematical area of game theory, a minimax theorem is a theorem providing conditions that guarantee that the max–min inequality is also an equality. The first theorem in this sense is von Neumann's minimax theorem about zero-sum games published in 1928, which was considered the starting point of game theory. Von Neumann is quoted as saying \"As far as I can see, there could be no theory of games ... without that theorem ... I thought there was nothing worth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved\". Since then, several generalizations and alternative versions of von Neumann's original theorem have appeared in the literature.Formally, von Neumann's minimax theorem states:Let                     X        ⊂                              R                                n                                {\\displaystyle X\\subset \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}   and                     Y        ⊂                              R                                m                                {\\displaystyle Y\\subset \\mathbb {R} ^{m}}   be compact convex sets.

The song, reworked from a 1983 demo track originally composed by Jackson and Canadian singer-songwriter Paul Anka, was the first single released from Jackson's second posthumous album, \"Xscape\".  Two versions of the single were developed.  The first was a solo version produced by American record producer John McClain and Dutch record producer Giorgio Tuinfort.  The second version was a duet featuring American singer Justin Timberlake, produced by American record producers Timbaland and J-Roc, which received positive reviews from music critics.  Its accompanying music video premiered on May 14, 2014 on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\".  In it, Timberlake appears with a crowd of young dancers, who reference Jackson's most known dance moves, interspersed with archival footage of the late pop singer's many short films.  The song is the second collaboration between Jackson and Anka to be released since Jackson's death in 2009 — the first being \"This Is It\".

The single was Doolittle's debut in most European counties. In Greek mythology, Pygmalion (; Ancient Greek: Πυγμαλίων Pugmalíōn, gen.: Πυγμαλίωνος) was a legendary figure of Cyprus. He is most familiar from Ovid's narrative poem Metamorphoses, in which Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with a statue he had carved. In Ovid In book 10 of Ovid's Metamorphoses, Pygmalion was a Cypriot sculptor who carved a woman out of ivory alabaster. Post-classical sources name her Galatea.According to Ovid, when Pygmalion saw the Propoetides of Cyprus practicing prostitution, he began \"detesting the faults beyond measure which nature has given to women\". He determined to remain celibate and to occupy himself with sculpting. He made a sculpture of a woman that he found so perfect he fell in love with it. Pygmalion kisses and fondles the sculpture, brings it various gifts, and creates a sumptuous bed for it.In time, Aphrodite's festival day came and Pygmalion made offerings at the altar of Aphrodite. There, too afraid to admit his desire, he quietly wished for a bride who would be \"the living likeness of my ivory girl\". When he returned home, he kissed his ivory statue, and found that its lips felt warm. He kissed it again, and found that the ivory had lost its hardness. Aphrodite had granted Pygmalion's wish.Pygmalion married the ivory sculpture, which changed to a woman under Aphrodite's blessing. In Ovid's narrative, they had a daughter, Paphos, from whom is derived the name of the city.In some versions, Paphos was a son, and they also had a daughter, Metharme.Ovid's mention of Paphos suggests that he was drawing on a more circumstantial account than the source for a passing mention of Pygmalion in Pseudo-Apollodorus' Bibliotheke, a Hellenic mythography of the 2nd-century AD. Perhaps he drew on the lost narrative by Philostephanus that was paraphrased by Clement of Alexandria. Pygmalion is a play by George Bernard Shaw, named after a Greek mythological figure.  It was first presented on stage to the public in 1913. Pygmalion is a play by Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, named after the Greek mythological figure. It premiered at the Hofburg Theatre in Vienna on 16 October 1913 and was first presented on stage in German. Its English-language premiere took place at His Majesty's Theatre in London's West End in April 1914 and starred Herbert Beerbohm Tree as phonetics professor Henry Higgins and Mrs Patrick Campbell as Cockney flower-girl Eliza Doolittle. Shaw's play has been adapted many times, most notably as the 1938 film Pygmalion, the 1956 stage musical My Fair Lady, and its 1964 film version.    Inspiration  In ancient Greek mythology, Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures, which then came to life. The general idea of that myth was a popular subject for Victorian era British playwrights, including one of Shaw's influences, W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a successful play based on the story called Pygmalion and Galatea that was first presented in 1871. Shaw would also have been familiar with the musical Adonis and the burlesque version, Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed. Eliza Doolittle was inspired by Kitty Wilson, owner of a sidewalk flower stall at Norfolk Street, Strand, in London. Wilson continued selling flowers at the stall until September, 1958. Her daughter, Betty Benton, then took over, but was forced to close down a month later when the City of London decreed that the corner was no longer \"designated\" for street trading. Shaw mentioned that the character of Professor Henry Higgins was inspired by several British professors of phonetics: Alexander Melville Bell, Alexander J. Ellis, Tito Pagliardini, but above all the cantankerous Henry Sweet. Shaw is also very likely to have known the life story of Jacob Henle, a professor at Heidelberg University, who fell in love with Elise Egloff, a Swiss housemaid, forcing her through several years of bourgeois education to turn her into an adequate wife. Egloff died shortly after their marriage. Her story inspired various literary works, including a play by Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer and a novella by Gottfried Keller, comparing Henle with the Greek Pygmalion.    First productions   Shaw wrote the play in early 1912 and read it to actress Mrs Patrick Campbell in June.

Jacquetta of Luxembourg (1415 or 1416 – 30 May 1472) was a prominent figure in the Wars of the Roses. Through her short-lived first marriage to the Duke of Bedford, brother of King Henry V, she was firmly allied to the House of Lancaster. However, following the emphatic Lancastrian defeat at the Battle of Towton, she and her second husband Richard Woodville sided closely with the House of York. Three years after the battle and the accession of Edward IV of England, Jacquetta's eldest daughter Elizabeth Woodville married him and became queen consort of England. Jacquetta bore Woodville 14 children and stood trial on charges of witchcraft, of which she was exonerated. Family and ancestry Jacquetta was the eldest daughter of Peter I of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, Conversano and Brienne, and his wife Margaret of Baux (Margherita del Balzo of Andria). Her father Peter of Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol, was also the hereditary Count of Brienne from 1397 until his death in 1433. First marriage On 22 April 1433 at age 17, Jacquetta married John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, at Thérouanne. The Duke was the third son of King Henry IV of England and Mary de Bohun, and thus the grandson of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, himself the third son of King Edward III. The marriage was childless, and the Duke died on 15 September 1435 at Rouen. As was customary at the time, Jacquetta retained the title of her first husband after her second marriage and was always known as the Duchess of Bedford, this being a higher title than that of countess. Jacquetta inherited one-third of the Duke's main estates as her widow's share. Second marriage On Jacquetta's journey to England, she was escorted by Sir Richard Woodville, who was commissioned by Henry VI of England. During the journey, Jacquetta and Richard fell in love and married in secret (before 23 March 1437), without seeking the king's permission. Jacquetta had been granted dower lands following her first husband's death on condition that she not remarry without a royal licence. On learning of the marriage, Henry VI refused to see them, but was mollified by the payment of a fine of £1000. Eliza Sophie Caird (born 15 April 1988), better known by her stage name Eliza Doolittle, is an English musician and recording artist from Camden Town, London.  After performing her music in live venues around London from the age of 15, Eliza signed to Parlophone in 2008. Eliza Doolittle is an EP by British recording artist Eliza Doolittle.  It was released in the UK on 29 November 2009 by digital download. \"I Could Have Danced All Night\" is a song from the musical \"My Fair Lady\", with music written by Frederick Loewe and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner, published in 1956.

The EP, released in 1993, was the first official release under the Elephant 6 Recording Co. label. These Times is the second studio album by American rock band SafetySuit, released on January 10, 2012, through Universal Republic Records. The album follows their 2008 debut Life Left to Go. It was released exclusively through iTunes on January 3, 2012, before a wide release the following week. These Times was produced by Howard Benson, Ryan Tedder, and Espionage, along with several self-produced songs, departing from their previous work with producer Greg Archilla. The album reached number 7 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it their highest charting album to date. Track listing  Critical reception These Times received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Rick Florino of Artistdirect describes the album as \"a catchy, captivating, and classy outing from modern rock's finest young outfit\" that \"is the first must-have album of 2012\". Gregory Heaney of AllMusic rated the album three out of five stars and states: \"The album finds the band taking a more spacious approach to the genre, surrounding their heartfelt, midtempo jams in a warm blanket of reverb and keyboards, giving them a real sense of depth.\" Charts  Personnel Credits adapted from AllMusic Release history Source: Amazon.com References A survival suit, more accurately and currently referred to as an immersion suit, is a type of waterproof dry suit intended to protect the wearer from hypothermia if immersed in cold water or otherwise exposed after abandoning a vessel, especially in the open ocean.  Immersion suits usually have integral footwear, and a hood, and either built-in gloves or watertight wrist seals.Suits manufactured by several manufacturers also include an inflatable pillow which is permanently attached high on the back, or an inflatable tube that is attached with zippers at two points on the chest, each side of the main zipper, and circles the back. When inflated, both of these devices provide enhanced stability to the wearer, which, if conscious, allows them to keep the head above water, and to keep wind and seas from striking the face. The inflation tube is routed from the inflatable pillow over the left shoulder of the user, and secured in a loop on the chest.Immersion suits with buoyancy aids are provided with buddy lines to allow multiple survivors to connect to one another in the water, to keep survivors together.Some suits are manufactured with built-in hoisting lanyards, to allow easier retrieval from vessels with a higher freeboard that have hoisting capabilities.The first record of a \"survival suit\" was in 1930 when a New York firm, American Life Suit Corporation, offered merchant and fishing firms what it called a safety suit for crews of ocean vessels. The suit came packed in a small box and was put on like a boilersuit.The precursor of these suits was invented in 1872 by Clark S Merriman to rescue steamship passengers. It was made from rubber sheeting and became famous by the swim records of Paul Boyton. It was essentially a pair of rubber pants and shirt cinched tight at the waist with a steel band and strap. Within the suit were five air pockets the wearer could inflate by mouth through hoses. Similar to modern-day dry suits, the suit also kept its wearer dry. This essentially allowed wearers to float on their backs, using a double-sided paddle to propel themselves, feet-forward. Additionally, they could attach a small sail to save energy while slowly drifting to shore (because neither emergency radio transmitters nor rescue helicopters had been invented yet).The first immersion suit to gain USCG approval was invented by Gunnar Guddal. The Apples in Stereo, styled as The Apples in stereo, are an American rock band associated with Elephant Six Collective, a group of bands also including Neutral Milk Hotel and The Olivia Tremor Control.  The band is largely a product of lead vocalist/guitarist/producer Robert Schneider, who writes the majority of the band's music and lyrics.

The band is also well known for their appearance in a The Powerpuff Girls music video performing the song \"Signal in the Sky (Let's Go)\". It aired immediately after the show's seventh episode of season 4, \"Superfriends\", which was based on the song's lyrics. The band has appeared widely in television and film, including performances on The Colbert Report, Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Last Call with Carson Daly, guest hosting on MTV, song placements in numerous television shows, commercials and motion pictures, the performance of the single \"Energy\" by the contestants on American Idol, and a song recorded for children's show Yo Gabba Gabba.    Band history     1991–1993: The Apples  In late 1991, Robert Schneider met Jim McIntyre on a commuter bus in Denver, Colorado. Schneider had recently moved to Colorado from Ruston, Louisiana, and often initiated conversations with McIntyre.  When Schneider asked McIntyre what his music interests were, McIntyre named his two favorite bands: The Beatles and The Beach Boys — two bands which Schneider was particularly fond of.  Realizing that they shared many musical interests, McIntyre introduced Schneider to Hilarie Sidney.  McIntyre already had a band called Von Hemmling in which McIntyre played bass and Sidney played drums. With Schneider, they discussed the idea of starting a band and perhaps a recording label.

Schneider had recently moved to Colorado from Ruston, Louisiana, and often initiated conversations with McIntyre. Jim McIntyre is a musician best known as the man behind the Elephant 6 band Von Hemmling.  He was also the original bassist for The Apples in Stereo before leaving in 1993.  He has written or co-written many early songs for the band, including \"Stop Along the Way\", \"Touch The Water\", \"To Love The Vibration Of The Bulb\" and \"Dots 1-2-3\".  He also plays bass on several tracks that appear on the debut album \"Fun Trick Noisemaker\", as well as engineering and performing on other Apples in Stereo albums.  An incarnation of Robert Schneider's Pet Sounds Studio was located at McIntyre's residence, where influential albums such as \"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\" by Neutral Milk Hotel were recorded. Life Left to Go is the debut studio album by American rock band SafetySuit, released on May 13, 2008, through Universal Motown Records.  It was produced by Greg Archilla, who had previously collaborated with SafetySuit on their independent EP.  The album produced three singles, the most successful of which were \"Stay\" and \"Someone Like You\"; both charted on several \"Billboard\" charts in 2008 and 2009.  The song \"Annie\" was also released as a single in late 2009.  The album was met with a highly positive response by critics. Apples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit.  One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that as late as the 17th century, the word \"apple\" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit other than berries, but including nuts.  This term may even have extended to plant galls, as they were thought to be of plant origin (see oak apple).  For instance, when tomatoes were introduced into Europe, they were called \"love apples\".  In one Old English work, cucumbers are called \"eorþæppla\" (lit.  \"earth-apples'), just as in French, Dutch, Hebrew, Persian and Swiss German as well as several other German dialects, the words for potatoes mean \"earth-apples\" in English.  In some languages, oranges are called \"golden apples\" or \"Chinese apples\".  Datura is called 'thorn-apple\". Toffee apples, also known as candy apples in North America, are whole apples covered in a hard toffee or sugar candy coating, with a stick inserted as a handle.  These are a common treat at autumn festivals in Western culture in the Northern Hemisphere, such as Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night because these festivals fall in the wake of the annual apple harvest.  Although candy apples and caramel apples may seem similar, they are made using distinctly different processes. Hilarie Sidney is a musician most famously recognized as the longtime drummer for The Apples in Stereo.  She was previously married to Apples in Stereo frontman and Elephant 6 co-founder Robert Schneider.  Their divorce became publicly acknowledged in 2004.  She was one half of the now defunct Elephant 6 duo Secret Square and, with now-husband Per Ole Bratset, she is currently a major creative talent behind The High Water Marks. SafetySuit is an American pop rock and alternative rock band from Tulsa, Oklahoma, currently based in Nashville, Tennessee.

History     Origins, Day After Yesterday, and Crew EP (2004-2006)  SafetySuit originated as a band called Crew, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was originally composed of singer Doug Brown, drummer Tate Cunningham, bassist Jeremey Henshaw, and guitar players Curtis Lloyd and Jesse Carey, who met while attending Oral Roberts University. After winning a local battle of the bands, Crew began to increase in popularity in their hometown of Tulsa, OK, so the band recorded and co-produced Day After Yesterday with local producer David John. Curtis and Jesse left the band soon after to pursue other careers, and guitarist Dave Garofalo joined the band a few months later. In 2004 the band decided to relocate to Nashville, Tennessee and retitled Day After Yesterday to create the Crew EP. In the summer of 2005, the members of Crew were introduced to producer Greg Archilla and recorded a 4-song EP called Stay. The band continued to grow in popularity locally until they played a showcase at 12th & Porter where they were signed by Universal.

The song made its debut on December 20, 2006 on the Comedy Central program \"The Colbert Report\" where it was performed by Apples frontman, Robert Schneider during Episode number 193.  John Roger Ferguson (born October 20, 1978) is an American musician.  He is currently a member of The Apples in Stereo, and he was a founding member of Big Fresh.  His father, Roger Ferguson, was an associate of underground DIY figure R. Stevie Moore, and John appeared on Moore's recordings and radio shows by age three.  During his freshman year of college, Ferguson teamed up with Ben Fulton and Bryan Gore to form Big Fresh in 1998.  The band – with various lineup changes – recorded three albums.  In 2002, Ferguson met Robert Schneider of The Apples in Stereo, and they formed ulysses.  Their first release, \"010\", appeared in 2004 on the Eenie Meenie Records label, and received positive reviews.  In 2006, Schneider invited him to become a member of the Apples In Stereo, and Ferguson performed on the band's 2007 album, \"New Magnetic Wonder\".  Ferguson is also a member of the synth-folk band Deek hoi, continues to collaborate with R. Stevie Moore and perform with Big Fresh.  He also hosts \"The Percy Trout Hour\" radio show on WRFL in Lexington.He and Robert Schneider in 2015 Have created a new band called Spaceflyte which is a experimental pop band. The Elephant 6 Recording Company is a loosely defined musical collective from the United States. Notable bands associated with the collective include The Apples in Stereo, Beulah, Circulatory System, Elf Power, The Minders, Neutral Milk Hotel, of Montreal, and The Olivia Tremor Control. Although bands in Elephant 6 explore many different genres, they have a shared interest in psychedelic pop of the 1960s, with particular influence from bands such as the Beach Boys, the Beatles, and the Zombies. Their music sometimes features intentionally low fidelity production and experimental recording techniques.The collective started in Ruston, Louisiana in the late 1980s. The name was occasionally used to denote the home recordings made by four high school friends: Bill Doss, Will Cullen Hart, Jeff Mangum, and Robert Schneider. After high school, Schneider formed the Apples in Stereo; Doss, Hart, and Mangum formed the Olivia Tremor Control; and Mangum independently formed Neutral Milk Hotel. These three bands would serve as the basis for Elephant 6, and soon, many other bands joined. Athens, Georgia, and Denver, Colorado, became major hub cities, and the mid-to-late 1990s represented the peak years of activity for the collective.Due to the confluence of new bands and the dissolution of Neutral Milk Hotel and the Olivia Tremor Control, the collective stagnated in activity in the early 2000s. A brief resurgence in the late 2000s ended with the death of Doss, and in recent years the collective has remained relatively dormant. Journalists have described Elephant 6 as an important underground music movement, and a key contributor to the emergence of alternative rock and indie rock in the 1990s. History  Background and formation Noel Murray and Marcus Gilmer of The A.V. Club note the difficulty in defining the exact parameters of the collective due to the multitude of associated acts. Each act has their own unique sound, and musicians are often members of multiple bands. This problem is compounded by the fact that members will sometimes obfuscate the truth, such as misleading a Rolling Stone reporter into believing they lived in a communal compound in Athens. In 2012, the official Elephant 6 website read: \"A collective, a label ... a cult? Elephant 6 may be all of these things or none of these depending on your point of view.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: The Harry Winokur owned Mister Donut chain was was bought out by which large coffee and baked good chain in 1990?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nA tuile is a baked wafer, French in origin, generally arced in shape, wafer thin, crisp, sweet, or savory, that is made most often from dough (but also possibly from cheese), often served as an accompaniment of other dishes.  'Tuile' is the French word for \"tile,\" after the shape of roof tiles that the arced baked good most often resembles.  Tuiles are commonly added as garnishes to desserts such as panna cotta or used as edible cups for sorbet or ice cream. Lye rolls are a baked specialty in Germany (especially in Bavaria and Swabia), Austria, and Switzerland.  They are made by immersing bread rolls in a lye solution before baking.  The German name is \"Laugengebäck\" for any baked good dipped in lye.  The perhaps best known shape is the pretzel, while rolls or buns are specifically called \"Laugensemmel\" or \"Kastanie\" (Bavarian), \"Laugeweckle\", or \"Laugestängle\" (Swabian), and \"Laugenwecken\", \"Laugenbrötchen\" or \"Laugenstange\" (everywhere else in Germany); \"Laugenweckerl\" in Austria; \"Silserli\" or \"Laugenbrötli\" in Switzerland.  In some parts of Asia they are known as \"laugen rolls\". A Wiener Melange (German for \"Viennese Blend\") is a speciality coffee drink similar to a cappuccino.  The difference is sometimes assumed to be that the \"Melange\" is made with milder coffee but the Viennese coffee company Julius Meinl describes a \"Wiener Melange\" as \"one espresso shot served in a large coffee cup topped with steamed milk and milk foam\".  Cafe Sabarsky in Manhattan concurs.  At Cafe Sperl in Vienna, the \"Melange\" is half a cup of \"black coffee\" and half a cup \"creamy milk\", topped with milk foam.  Nescafe, Movenpick, and Lufthansa Catering however serve Wiener Melange as Coffee blended with Cocoa - no matter whether foam topped or not.  Kaffeehaus de Chatillon describes it as relatively equal portions of coffee, milk and cream foam in a 6oz cup. Dunkin' Park is a 6,121-seat baseball park in Hartford, Connecticut. It is the home field of the Hartford Yard Goats of the Eastern League. The stadium has a total capacity of 6,850 people, including standing room, which was reached numerous times during its inaugural season of 2017. It was planned to open for the 2016 season on April 7, but numerous constructions delays postponed this opening and forced the Yard Goats to play the entire season on the road. The stadium opened in time for the team's 2017 home opener on April 13.Dunkin' purchased the naming rights for the stadium for an undisclosed amount. The stadium initially maintained the Dunkin' Donuts name and branding after the company rebranded as Dunkin'. The ballpark was supposed to be part of a larger $400 million redevelopment plan called Downtown North (DoNo). DoNo would have included a 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) supermarket, the relocated Thomas Hooker Brewing Company, housing, retail, and restaurants. In December 2015 it was also announced that the development would include the first Hard Rock Hotel in New England. These plans were eventually scrapped. Dunkin' Park was voted as Ballpark Digest's best minor league ballpark among Double-A facilities in both 2017 and 2018. Construction delays In December 2015, it was reported that the project was $10 million over budget and the park might not be ready for opening day on April 7, 2016. In January 2016, it was confirmed that the Hartford Yard Goats would play their first month of the season on the road because the developers and the City of Hartford could not reach an agreement on how to solve the budget shortfall and finish construction on time.Owing to numerous additional delays during the winter and spring of 2016, new target dates, at first May 17 and later May 31, were set as Opening Day for the Yard Goats at Dunkin' Park, but work again was not complete on the ballpark in time for the team to move in.  Yard Goats home games between May 17 and June 5 were moved to Dodd Stadium in Norwich, Connecticut, a 45-minute drive southeast of Hartford.  The Yard Goats returned to playing all games on the road in mid-June, when Dodd Stadium's primary tenant, the Connecticut Tigers of the New York-Penn League, began their season. \"Seventies\" is a song by Japanese dance unit, MAX.  It is a Japanese cover of Italo disco artist Mega NRG Man's song of the same name.  It was composed by Groove Surfers with Japanese lyrics written by Kazumi Suzuki.  It was released as their fourth single and the original version of the song appears on the albums, \"Maximum\" (1996), \"Maximum Collection\" (1999) and \"Precious Collection 1995–2002\" (2002).  It was used in commercials for Japanese brand donuts Mister Donut.  It was also the group's first top ten single debuting and peaking at #7. A peel is a shovel-like tool used by bakers to slide loaves of bread, pizzas, pastries, and other baked goods into and out of an oven.  It is usually made of wood, with a flat carrying surface (like a shovel's blade) for holding the baked good and a handle extending from one side of that surface.  Alternatively, the carrying surface may be made of sheet metal, which is attached to a wooden handle.  Wood has the advantage that it does not become hot enough to burn the user's hands the way metal can, even if it is frequently in the oven.  The word presumably derives from the French \"pelle\", which describes both a peel and a shovel. The Amica Mutual Pavilion (originally Providence Civic Center and formerly Dunkin' Donuts Center (\"The Dunk\")) is an indoor arena located in downtown Providence, Rhode Island. It was built in 1972, as a home court for the Providence College Friars men's basketball program, due to the high demand for tickets to their games in Alumni Hall, as well as for a home arena for the then–Providence Reds, who played in the nearly 50-year-old Rhode Island Auditorium. Current tenants include the Providence Bruins ice hockey team, of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Providence College Friars men's basketball team, of the Big East Conference. The center is operated by the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority, which also operates the Rhode Island Convention Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium. Background The idea for a Civic Center in Providence had been proposed as early as 1958, on the site of what later became the Providence Place Mall. The project was proposed as a joint federal-state-city project, which would create jobs and bring economic benefits. However, the plan failed due to the inability to secure federal funds.The plan was revived again as a statewide bond issue in the 1968 general election; voters outside of Providence soundly defeated the referendum. Finally, mayor Joseph A. Doorley Jr. pushed through a citywide special referendum in 1969, which passed. When this amount proved to be inadequate, Doorley pushed through another referendum in 1971, which also passed. The project became so closely associated with Mayor Doorley that it was referred to in the press as \"Doorley's Dream\". History The Providence Civic Center was constructed in 1972 on the site of an old jewelry factory.  The opening ceremony was held November 3, 1972, with a Providence Reds hockey game. President Richard Nixon, campaigning in the area, was invited to the attend the opening, but he declined. In its first year, the center hosted concerts by Pink Floyd and Frank Sinatra, as well as hockey games and political rallies, and was considered a success.In October 1974, Civic Center director Harold Copeland was convicted of soliciting a $1,000 bribe from a concert promoter. Dunkin' Donuts is an American global donut company and coffeehouse based in Canton, Massachusetts, in Greater Boston.  It was founded in 1950 by William Rosenberg in Quincy, Massachusetts.  Since its founding, the company has grown to become one of the largest coffee and baked goods chains in the world, with more than 12,000 restaurants in 36 countries.  The chain's products include donuts, bagels, other baked goods, and a wide variety of hot and iced beverages.

Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins eventually became subsidiaries of Dunkin' Brands, headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, in 2004, until being purchased by Inspire Brands on December 15, 2020. The chain began rebranding as a \"beverage-led company\", and was renamed Dunkin', in January 2019; while stores in the U.S. began using the new name, the company intends to roll out the rebranding to all of its international stores eventually. With approximately 12,900 locations in 42 countries, Dunkin' is one of the largest coffee shop and donut shop chains in the world.  In addition to various varieties of coffee and donuts, products sold include bagels, breakfast sandwiches, muffins, and donut holes branded as Munchkins.    History     1948–1963: Founding years   Bill Rosenberg opened Open Kettle in 1948, a restaurant selling donuts and coffee in Quincy, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston), but he changed the name in 1950 to Dunkin' Donuts after discussing with company executives. He conceived the idea for the restaurant after his experiences selling food in factories and at construction sites, where donuts and coffee were the two most popular items. The restaurant was successful, and Rosenberg sold franchises to others starting in 1955.    1963–1998: Bob Rosenberg  In 1963 Rosenberg's son Bob became CEO of the company at age 25, and Dunkin' Donuts opened its hundredth location that year.

I Would Like to See You Again is the 57th album by American country singer Johnny Cash, released on Columbia Records in 1978.  The title track peaked at #12 on the singles chart, while \"There Ain't No Good Chain Gang\" reached #2; the album itself peaked at #23.  The album features a pair of duets with Waylon Jennings, one of which was the \"There Ain't No Good Chain Gang\" single; it was one of Cash's first collaborations with Jennings, and the two recorded songs together throughout the 1980s, including a separate album entitled \"Heroes\".

Mister Donut is an international chain of doughnut stores. It was founded in the United States in 1956 by Harry Winokur. Primary offerings include doughnuts, coffee, muffins and pastries. After being acquired by Allied Domecq in 1990, most of the North American stores became Dunkin' Donuts. Outside of the United States, Mister Donut maintains a presence in Japan, El Salvador, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Singapore. History In 1955, Harry Winokur worked with brother-in-law William Rosenberg, the founder of Dunkin' Donuts. After Winokur broke his partnership with Rosenberg, he went on to create Mister Donut with his son-in-law David Slater that same year, with stores in most of North America. The Mister Donut business became so popular that Winokur and Slater decided to go into franchising. As a result, Mister Donut began a rapid expansion that resulted in the opening of 275 stores in the U.S. and Canada. In 1970, Minneapolis-based International Multifoods Corporation, one of the world's largest and most successful food companies, acquired Mister Donut and its franchising concept from Winokur.The first Mister Donut outlet in Japan opened in Minoh, Osaka in 1971. Also in the same year, a Mister Donut training center was constructed in Japan. In 1973, the French cruller became available in Japan stores. In 1978, brothers Sutthichai and Sutthikiat Chirathiwat, on the behalf of Thai Franchise Co., Ltd, opened the first Mister Donut store in Siam Square, Bangkok. The two would come to pioneer the donut market within Thailand. In 2003, Mister Donut in Thailand came under the management CRG. Donut Thailand (Central Restaurants Group) which continues to manage the company in Thailand. In 1983, Duskin Co., Ltd. of Osaka, Japan, acquired the rights to franchise Mister Donut throughout Japan and Asia.In the 1980s, Mister Donut was the largest competitor to Dunkin' Donuts. On March 31, 1987, Elie G. Saheb and his business associates acquired the trademark rights for Mister Donut in the United Kingdom and afterwards opened a Mister Donut pilot store and bakery in Fulham, London.

Originally formed by eponymous frontman Noel Gallagher in 2010 following his departure from Oasis, the band released their self-titled debut album in October 2011. It topped the UK Albums Chart and has since sold over 820,000 copies in the UK. Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds was supported by five singles, two of which reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart. B-sides from the first four of these were released in April 2012 as Songs from the Great White North...A year after the release of their debut album, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds released the live video album International Magic Live at the O2, which documented the band's performance at The O2 Arena in February 2012. The album topped the UK Music Video Chart. The follow-up to the band's self-titled debut, Chasing Yesterday, was released in February 2015. The release once again topped the UK Albums Chart. The lead single from the album, \"In the Heat of the Moment\", reached number 26 on the UK Singles Chart, although later single releases have reached lower positions on the chart.

The album was released in February 2006 on the Italian label Frontiers Records, with a world tour to follow.  It was the band's first studio release since \"Through the Looking Glass\" in 2002, and the first to include keyboardist/vocalist Greg Phillinganes.  Phillinganes originally began playing with Toto as a touring replacement for David Paich, who had retired from the road.  Another Porcaro brother, Steve, helped found the group and continues to work in the studio with the band, though he quit as a full-time member following the \"Fahrenheit\" album in 1987.  Similarly, Lenny Castro has never been a member of the group, but has consistently contributed to their recordings since their first album, in 1978. V is the fifth studio album released by the traditionally instrumental stoner rock band Karma to Burn.  It is their second studio release since reforming from their 7-year hiatus in 2009.  It was released on May 27, 2011, via Napalm Records.  Unlike their previous releases since \"Karma to Burn\", this is not an instrumental album.  Only five tracks are instrumental; the other three feature vocals from Year Long Disaster frontman Daniel Davies, who had joined the group but left prior to the album's release. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is a song by English pop rock band Tears for Fears from their second studio album Songs from the Big Chair (1985). It was written by Roland Orzabal, Ian Stanley, and Chris Hughes and produced by Hughes. It was released on 22 March 1985 by Phonogram, Mercury, and Vertigo Records as the third single from the album. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is a new wave and synth-pop song with lyrics that detail the desire humans have for control and power and centre on themes of corruption.An international success, the song peaked at number two in Ireland, Australia, and the United Kingdom and at number one in Canada, New Zealand, and on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and Cashbox. It was certified gold by both Music Canada (MC) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Retrospectively, music critics have praised \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\", with some ranking the song among the decade's best. Along with \"Shout\" (1984), it is one of the band's signature songs.A music video received promotion from MTV. The year of the song's release, it was featured in the ending to the science fiction comedy film Real Genius. In 1986, the song won Best Single at the Brit Awards, and was re-recorded by the band as a charity single for the Sport Aid campaign the same year. \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" has been covered extensively since its release, most notably by New Zealand singer Lorde for the soundtrack to the film adaptation of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Background and release \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was written by Roland Orzabal, Ian Stanley and Chris Hughes, and produced by Hughes. The song was a \"last-minute\" addition during recording sessions of Songs from the Big Chair (1985). The decision to include the song in the album came after Orzabal played two chords on his acoustic guitar for Hughes. It was recorded in two weeks and added as the final track on the album. According to Orzabal, the final line in the song's chorus, originally written as \"Everybody wants to go to war\", contributed to his indifference towards the track.In an interview with Mix magazine, Hughes said that \"as a piece of recording history, [the song is] bland as hell\". Rise to Your Knees is the Meat Puppets' eleventh full-length studio album, released on July 17, 2007.  Not only was it their first studio release since 2000's \"Golden Lies\", it was also their first to feature the original bassist Cris Kirkwood since his departure after the release of 1995's \"No Joke! \".  The album was given a one-month advance release on the iTunes Store and eMusic. Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds are an English rock band formed in 2010 as the solo moniker of former Oasis songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist Noel Gallagher. The touring band consists of former Oasis members Gem Archer (guitar), Mike Rowe (piano), and Chris Sharrock (drums), as well as former Zutons bassist Russell Pritchard. The band has also had a variety of guests contribute to albums such as the Crouch End Festival Chorus, Amorphous Androgynous, Johnny Marr, and Paul Weller.Since his departure from Oasis in August 2009, many speculated that Gallagher might record a solo album. In July 2011, he held a press conference to confirm this, after denying rumours from his brother Liam had already heard the tracks featured on it. Later that year, Noel released the project's self-titled debut album. Several singles from the album were released, including \"The Death of You and Me\", \"If I Had a Gun...\", \"AKA... What a Life!\", \"Dream On\", and \"Everybody's on the Run\". In 2015, High Flying Birds released their second album, Chasing Yesterday. Their third, Who Built the Moon?, was released in November 2017, which was followed by 3 EPs released between 2019 and 2020. Their fourth studio album, Council Skies, was released in June 2023.Gallagher stated in an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show that the inspiration for the band's name was from two sources: the idea to prefix the name with \"Noel Gallagher's\" was formed while he was listening to the album Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, while the latter part of the name is taken from the song \"High Flying Bird\", most notably recorded by Jefferson Airplane. History  Break-up of Oasis (2009–2010) On 12 July 2009, rumours began to spread that Noel Gallagher intended to go solo, but these appear to have had no foundation. However, two months later, a fight between the Gallagher brothers took place in a backstage area, reportedly resulting in Noel's guitar being smashed by Liam, and Noel subsequently storming off. On 28 August 2009 Oasis' manager announced the cancellation of their concert at the Rock en Seine festival near Paris just minutes before it was about to begin, along with the cancellation of the European tour and a statement that Oasis \"does not exist anymore\". in•ter a•li•a is the fourth studio album by post-hardcore band At the Drive-In, released on May 5, 2017.

Formerly called the RCA Building from 1933 to 1988, and later the GE Building from 1988 to 2015, it was renamed the Comcast Building on July 1, 2015, following the transfer of ownership to new corporate owner Comcast.  Its name is often shortened to 30 Rock.  The building is most famous for housing the NBC television network headquarters.  At 850 ft high, the 70-story building is the 14th tallest in New York City and the 39th tallest in the United States.  It stands 400 feet (122 m) shorter than the Empire State Building. 30 Rockefeller Plaza (officially the Comcast Building; formerly RCA Building and GE Building) is a skyscraper that forms the centerpiece of Rockefeller Center in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, United States. Completed in 1933, the 66-story, 850 ft (260 m) building was designed in the Art Deco style by Raymond Hood, Rockefeller Center's lead architect. 30 Rockefeller Plaza was known for its main tenant, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), from its opening in 1933 until 1988 and then for General Electric until 2015, when it was renamed for its current owner, Comcast.

The first tenant moved into the building on April 22, 1933, but its official opening was delayed due to controversy over Man at the Crossroads. The Rainbow Room and the observation deck opened in the mid-1930s, and retail space was added to the ground floor in the 1950s. The building remained almost fully occupied through the 20th century and was renamed for GE in 1988. 30 Rockefeller Plaza (officially the Comcast Building; formerly RCA Building and GE Building) is a skyscraper that forms the centerpiece of Rockefeller Center in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, United States.

It is the second highest restaurant in New York City behind One Dine on the 101st floor of One World Trade Center. 75 Rockefeller Plaza is a skyscraper on the north side of 51st Street in New York City, originally built as a northern extension of Rockefeller Center. History In July 1944, the Rockefellers began planning a new 16-story tower to house the Standard Oil Company (Esso), which had outgrown its lease at the nearby 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The structure was completed in 1947 in the early Modernist style. It was originally known as the Esso Building. At completion, the building was the tallest completely air-conditioned building in New York City and the first in Rockefeller Center. The building also housed Schrafft's Restaurant, which had a capacity of 1,283 people, making it the largest restaurant in the world at the time. Standard Oil's successor, Exxon, moved to the newly built 1251 Avenue of the Americas in 1971.In 1973, the heating, ventilation, and air‐conditioning systems in the building were replaced, along with some upgrades to the electrical systems. After these renovations, Warner Communications (later Time Warner) leased all 570,000 square feet (53,000 m2) of Exxon's former space, which led to the building becoming known as the Warner Communications Building. Warner initially occupied only 340,000 square feet (32,000 m2) of space and subleased the rest to tenants including the Financial Times, Thomson-CSF, PBS, and The Economist. In December 1996, a fire at the TGI Fridays in the basement of the building led to a minor explosion in a top-floor equipment room, causing the building to be evacuated. In 2012, Time Warner indicated that they would not be renewing their space in the building due to their move to Time Warner Center, which would leave the building virtually empty in 2014.After Time Warner vacated the space, Rockefeller Center's owners brought in RXR Realty by a $500 million, 99-year lease to manage the building's office space. As part of the deal, RXR would spend $250 million to renovate the building in a plan designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox. The renovation included a new lobby, replacement of the elevator cabs, new mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems, and a complete façade restoration.

Via its Universal Destinations & Experiences division, NBCUniversal is also the third-largest operator of amusement parks in the world. Since 2018, its sister company under Comcast's control, Sky Group Limited, holds its media and telecommunication assets.NBCUniversal was formed on May 11, 2004, beginning on November 8, 2004 as NBC Universal, Inc., with the merger of General Electric (GE)'s NBC with Vivendi Universal's film and television subsidiary Vivendi Universal Entertainment, after GE had acquired 80% of the subsidiary, giving Vivendi a 20% share of the new company. In 2011, Comcast attained 51% and thereby the control of newly reformed NBCUniversal, by purchasing shares from GE, while GE bought out Vivendi. Since 2013, the company has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast, which bought GE's ownership stake. History  Early history NBC and Universal Television had a partnership dating back to 1950, when Universal Television's earliest ancestor, Revue Studios, produced a number of shows for NBC, although Revue would have hits on other networks as well. This partnership continued throughout a number of name changes and changes of ownership. Television NBC Universal Television has its modern roots in a series of expansions undertaken by NBC. In the late 1980s, NBC began pursuing a strategy of diversification, including the formation of two NBC-owned cable-television networks: CNBC and America's Talking. Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 commercial buildings covering 22 acres (89,000 m2) between 48th Street and 51st Street in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. The 14 original Art Deco buildings, commissioned by the Rockefeller family, span the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, split by a large sunken square and a private street called Rockefeller Plaza. Later additions include 75 Rockefeller Plaza across 51st Street at the north end of Rockefeller Plaza, and four International Style buildings on the west side of Sixth Avenue.In 1928, Columbia University, the owner of the site, leased the land to John D. Rockefeller Jr., who was the main person behind the complex's construction. Originally envisioned as the site for a new Metropolitan Opera building, the current Rockefeller Center came about after the Met could not afford to move to the proposed new building. Various plans were discussed before the current one was approved in 1932. Construction of Rockefeller Center started in 1931, and the first buildings opened in 1933. The core of the complex was completed by 1939. Described as one of the greatest projects of the Great Depression era, Rockefeller Center became a New York City designated landmark in 1985 and a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The complex and associated land has been controlled since 2000 by Tishman Speyer, which bought the property for $1.85 billion.The original center has several sections. Radio City, along Sixth Avenue and centered on 30 Rockefeller Plaza, includes Radio City Music Hall and was built for RCA's radio-related enterprises such as NBC. The International Complex along Fifth Avenue was built to house foreign-based tenants. The remainder of the original complex originally hosted printed media as well as Eastern Air Lines. While 600 Fifth Avenue is at the southeast corner of the complex, it was built by private interests in the 1950s and was only acquired by the center in 1963. The complex is noted for the large quantities of art present in almost all of its buildings, its expansive underground concourse, its ice-skating rink, and its annual lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree. History  Context The first private owner of the site was physician David Hosack, who purchased twenty acres of rural land from New York City in 1801 and opened the country's first botanical garden, the Elgin Botanic Garden, on the site. Studio 8H is a television studio located in New York City in the United States.  The studio is a part of NBC Studios, the home of the NBC television network, located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.  It is most notable for housing the live broadcast of \"Saturday Night Live\", which has been broadcast from the studio since its inception. 30 Rock is an American satirical television sitcom created by Tina Fey that ran on NBC from October 11, 2006, to January 31, 2013.  The series, loosely based on Fey's experiences as head writer for \"Saturday Night Live\", takes place behind the scenes of a fictional live sketch comedy show depicted as airing on NBC.  The series's name refers to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, the address of the Comcast Building, where the NBC Studios are located and where \"Saturday Night Live\" is written, produced, and performed.  This series is produced by Broadway Video and Little Stranger, Inc., in association with NBCUniversal. NBCUniversal Media Group is the television and streaming arm of NBCUniversal, and the direct descendant and successor of the former division NBCUniversal Television Group, which existed from 2004 to 2019. History  NBC Broadcasting In 2006, NBCUniversal sold four stations from its smallest markets. In November 2007, the NBC Owned Television Stations changed its name to NBC Local Media. In March 2008, Local Media decided to focus on growing websites and the top ten market stations, placing WTVJ in Miami and WVIT in Hartford up for sale.LXTV was acquired in January 2008 by NBC Local Media followed in March by the purchased of Skycastle Entertainment, Local Media's former outside sales and marketing firm. After NBC Weather Plus was shut down in late 2008, WNBC launched a replacement programming of local information, news and lifestyle as NBC New York Nonstop in March 2009 using LXTV programs.In May 2009, NBC rolled out a tiered affiliation plan. The plan has three levels: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Bronze is the standard existing short term affiliation,  programming with ad inventory splits. With the silver plan, the affiliate and network would add working in other media: internet, wireless and video on demand areas with inventory splits, a different financial arrangement and promotion commitments. Gold affiliation agreement is a longer broader partnership in local online media and mobile digital TV with the network representing the gold affiliates in cable and satellite retransmission consent negotiations with the network sharing in the carriage revenue. A NBClocal.com livestyle website would be a part of the silver package. By July 2009, GE has been registering NBCmarket.com domains (like NBCIndianapolis.com) in markets where NBC stations are not NBC owned. NBC Affiliates Board chair Mike Fiorile indicated a preference on behalf of local stations that the local station should own its own brand in the market. Local Newser indicated that this might be attempt by NBC to compete with their local affiliates despite pointing out the NBC local program as a part of its top tier affiliation plans.On October 24, 2012, NBC Owned Television Stations announced it will relaunch the NBC Nonstop network as Cozi TV, which will feature classic television shows, films and original programming.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Theorycraft often involves analyzing hidden systems or underlying game code in order to glean information that is not apparent during normal gameplay.  The term has been said to come from Starcraft players as a portmanteau of \"StarCraft\" and \"game theory\".  Theorycraft is similar to analyses performed in sports or other games, such as baseball's sabermetrics. Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age is a role-playing video game by Square Enix. The eleventh entry in the long-running Dragon Quest video game series, it was released in Japan for the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation 4 in July 2017 and worldwide for the PlayStation 4 and Windows in September 2018. An enhanced version, Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition, was released for Nintendo Switch by Nintendo in September 2019; for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in December 2020; and for Stadia in March 2021. Taking place in a world called Erdrea, the game follows the hero's quest to save the world from an impending darkness. Throughout the game, he explores challenges related to his prophesied Luminary identity as he endures persecution from those who demonize him. One of the first games announced for the Switch, the game was originally conceived to be fully open world, but the idea was discarded when it conflicted with the story the developers wanted to tell. To increase the awareness of the Dragon Quest franchise in the west, support for Windows and features such as voiced English dialogue and 4K resolution were included. Elements added later included an expanded plot and an option to listen to an orchestral version of the score.Upon release, the game received critical acclaim for its story, characters, narrative, and localization, though its design was criticized for being overly traditional. The game shipped over six million copies by September 2020. The protagonist, the Luminary, has also been featured in crossover media such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Gameplay Dragon Quest XI continues the gameplay of previous games in the series, in which the player explores worlds and fights against various monsters, including the ability to explore high areas. The Nintendo 3DS version features a different style to the other versions, showcasing 3D graphics on the top screen and 16-bit styled sprites on the bottom screen. Outside of battle, the player can freely toggle between the 3D and 2D graphical styles. Like with Dragon Quest IX, on land, the game's battle system features no random encounters and shows all enemies on the overworld. A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, as well as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world.  Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games (Including \"Dungeons & Dragons\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics.  Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion.  The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed.  RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. The British Academy Video Games Award for Game Design is an award presented annually by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).  It is given in honor of \"the best game design that captivates and engages the player\", including recognition of elements such as game mechanics, use of controls, level and world structure, and pacing.  The award was first given at the 8th British Academy Video Games Awards ceremony, held in 2012, with the Valve Corporation title \"Portal 2\" winning the award. Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation, titled Dragon Warrior III when initially localized to North America, is a 1988 role-playing video game developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix. It is the third installment in the Dragon Quest series and was first released for the Family Computer (Famicom) in Japan and later for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America. The game saw an enhanced remake for the Super Famicom (the Japanese release of the Super NES) in 1996 and the Game Boy Color in 2001, and a port to mobile phones and the Wii in 2009 and 2011. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on September 25, 2014, and worldwide as Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation on December 4, 2014. It was the first time the game was given an official English subtitle. Later in 2021, another remake of the game titled Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, based on Octopath Traveler's style, was announced during the franchise's 35th anniversary livestream, and later confirmed in the June 2024 Nintendo Direct to release in November that same year.The first three Dragon Quest games are part of the same story, and Dragon Warrior III is the first game chronologically, as well as the third game that features the hero Erdrick (Loto in the Japanese releases and Game Boy Color localization). The story follows \"the Hero\" who is tasked with saving the world from the archfiend Baramos. Gathering a group of companions into a party, the Hero must travel the world, stopping at various towns and locations, and make their way to the Demon Lord Baramos' lair. Gameplay Dragon Quest III is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the original Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II. The game uses basic role-playing video game conventions such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. The battle system is turn-based like the other games in the series, though the remakes incorporate various interface changes from later titles. These include simpler door opening, a bag to store items instead of keeping them at a bank, quick item sorting with \"Tidy Item\" and \"Tidy Bag\" command, and a \"Full HP\" command to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. And while earlier Dragon Quest games were non-linear in structure, Dragon Quest III featured an even more open-world experience. Emergent gameplay refers to complex situations in video games, board games, or table top role-playing games that emerge from the interaction of relatively simple game mechanics. Survival horror is a subgenre of video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience.  Although combat can be part of the gameplay, the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition, health, speed and vision, or through various obstructions of the player's interaction with the game mechanics.  The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game.  Games make use of strong horror themes, like dark maze-like environments and unexpected attacks from enemies. Awithlaknannai Mosona is a two-player strategy board game from the Zuni Native American Indian tribe of New Mexico, United States.  It is unknown how old the game is.  The game was described by Stewart Culin in his book \"Games of the North American Indians Volume 2: Games of Skill\" (1907).  In this book, it was named Awithlaknan Mosona.  Awithlaknannai Mosona resembles another Zuni board game called Kolowis Awithlaknannai (Fighting Serpents) with few minor differences.  The former having a smaller board, and depending upon the variant, it also has less lines joining the intersection points.  The rules are the same.  Awithlaknannai Mosona belongs to the draughts and Alquerque family of games as pieces hop over one another when capturing.  It is actually more related to Alquerque, since the board is made up of intersection points and lines connecting them.  It is thought that the Spanish had brought Alquerque to the American Southwest, and Awithlaknannai Mosona may have been an evolution from Alquerque.  However, in Stewart Culin's 1907 book, the Zunis claim that they had adopted a hunt game from Mexico similar to Catch the Hare and the Fox games of Europe, and transformed it into Awithlaknannai Mosona.  In these games, one player has more pieces over the other, however, the other player's piece has more powers.  The Zuni's equalized the numbers of pieces and their powers, and also may have transformed the board making its length far exceed its width.  Diagonal lines also replaced orthogonal lines altogether.  However, the hunt game from Mexico may have used an Alquerque board even though the game mechanics of their new game, Awithlaknannai Mosona, were completely different. The Marriage is an experimental art game for Windows created by Rod Humble in 2006.  Humble had set out to explore the kinds of artistic expression unique to video games, leading him to express his feelings associated with marriage by relying on game mechanics rather than traditional storytelling, audio, or video elements. Dragon Quest, published as Dragon Warrior in North America until 2005, is a series of console role-playing video games created by Yuji Horii and his studio Armor Project. Dragon Quest, previously published as Dragon Warrior in North America until 2005, is a series of role-playing games created by Japanese game designers Armor Project (Yuji Horii), Bird Studio (Akira Toriyama) and Sugiyama Kobo (Koichi Sugiyama) to its publisher Enix, with all of the involved parties co-owning the copyright of the series since then. The games are published by Square Enix (formerly Enix) since its inception, with localized remakes and ports of later installments for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch being published by Nintendo outside of Japan. With its first game published in 1986, there are eleven main-series games, along with numerous spin-off games. In addition, there have been numerous manga, anime and novels published under the franchise, with nearly every game in the main series having a related adaptation. The series introduced a number of features to the genre and has had a significant impact on the development of other role-playing games. Installments of the series have appeared on various computers, consoles, handheld devices, and mobile phones. Early in the series, the Dragon Quest games were released under the title Dragon Warrior in North America to avoid trademark conflict with the unrelated tabletop role-playing game DragonQuest. Square Enix did not register the Dragon Quest trademark for use in the United States until 2002. The basic premise of most Dragon Quest games is to play a hero (actually named \"Hero\" in spinoff fiction, but in some games, the player is able to name their hero) who is out to save the land from peril at the hands of a powerful evil enemy, with the hero usually accompanied by a group of party members. Common elements persist throughout the series and its spinoff games: turn-based combat; recurring monsters, including the Slime, which became the series' mascot; a text-based menu system; and random encounters in most of the main series. While over the decades many different development companies worked on Dragon Quest, the series has had its creators since its inception, as scenario writer and game designer Yuji Horii, (and prior to their deaths,) character designer Akira Toriyama and music composer Koichi Sugiyama have handled their respective roles on most games in the series. The original concepts, used since the first game, took elements from the Western role-playing games Wizardry and Ultima. Dragon Quest, previously published as Dragon Warrior in North America until 2005, is a series of role-playing games created by Japanese game designer Yuji Horii (Armor Project), character designer Akira Toriyama (Bird Studio), and composer Koichi Sugiyama (Sugiyama Kobo) and published by Square Enix (formerly Enix). Since its inception, development of games in the series have been outsourced to a plethora of external companies until the tenth installment, with localized remakes and ports of later installments for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch being published by Nintendo outside of Japan.

The original concepts, used since the first game, took elements from the Western role-playing games Wizardry and Ultima. Mother (known as EarthBound outside Japan) is a video game series that consists of three role-playing video games: Mother (1989), known as EarthBound Beginnings outside Japan, for the Family Computer; Mother 2 (1994), known as EarthBound outside Japan, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System; and Mother 3 (2006) for the Game Boy Advance.Written by Shigesato Itoi, published by Nintendo, and featuring game mechanics modeled on the Dragon Quest series, Mother is known for its sense of humor, originality, and parody. The player uses weapons and psychic powers to fight hostile enemies, which include animated everyday objects, aliens and brainwashed people. Signature elements of the series include a lighthearted approach to the plot, battle sequences with psychedelic backgrounds, and the \"rolling HP meter\": player health ticks down like an odometer rather than instantly being subtracted, allowing the player to take preventative action, such as healing or finishing the battle, before the damage is fully dealt. While the franchise is popular in Japan, in the Anglosphere it is best associated with the cult following behind EarthBound.While visiting Nintendo for other business, Itoi approached Shigeru Miyamoto about making Mother. When approved for a sequel, Itoi increased his involvement in the design process over the five-year development of EarthBound. When the project began to flounder, producer and later Nintendo president Satoru Iwata rescued the game. EarthBound's English localizers were given great liberties when translating the Japanese game's cultural allusions. The American version sold poorly despite a multimillion-dollar marketing budget. Mother 3 was originally slated for release on the Nintendo 64 and its 64DD disk drive accessory, but was cancelled in 2000. Three years later, the project was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance alongside a rerelease of Mother and Mother 2 in the combined cartridge Mother 1 + 2. Mother 3 abandoned the 3D graphics progress for a 2D style, and became a bestseller upon its release. EarthBound was rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013, and Mother received its English-language debut for the same platform in 2015, retitled EarthBound Beginnings. In 2022, Nintendo released Mother 1 and 2 to their Nintendo Switch Online service. Mother, officially known outside of Japan as EarthBound Beginnings, is a role-playing video game developed by Ape Inc., Nintendo Tokyo R&D Products, and Pax Softnica and published by Nintendo for the Family Computer. It is the first entry in the Mother series and was first released in Japan on July 27, 1989. The game was re-released in Japan along with its sequel on the single-cartridge compilation Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The game follows a young American boy named Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies on psychic powers to put an end to the paranormal phenomena spiraling the country into disarray.Writer and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mother's concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. Modeled after the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, Mother subverted its fantasy genre contemporaries by being set in an offbeat parody of the late 20th-century United States. Itoi sought to incorporate standard RPG staples within the framework of a modern-day setting, parodying Western culture and Americana; throughout the game, players use medication and hospitals to revive their health, utilize baseball bats and toy guns to fight enemies, and encounter aliens, robots, possessed objects, and brainwashed animals and humans. Mother uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person perspective battle system.Mother sold around 400,000 copies upon its release, where it was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes, though its high difficulty level and balance issues polarized critics. A North American localization of Mother was completed and slated for release as Earth Bound, but was abandoned as being commercially nonviable. A finished prototype was later found and publicly circulated on the Internet under the informal title EarthBound Zero. Though many critics considered Mother's sequel to be similar and an overall better implementation of its gameplay ideas, Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com wrote that Mother importantly generated interest in video game emulation and the historical preservation of unreleased games.In 1994, Mother's sequel, Mother 2: Gīgu no Gyakushū, was released in Japan for the Super Famicom, which was localized and released in America in 1995 under the name \"EarthBound\". The Mother series is a role-playing video game series created by Shigesato Itoi for Nintendo. The series started in 1989 with the Japan-only release of Mother, which was followed up by Mother 2, released as EarthBound outside Japan, for the Super NES in 1994. A second sequel was released in Japan only, Mother 3, for the Game Boy Advance in 2006. The music of the Mother series includes the soundtracks to all three games; the first game was composed for by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka, who were joined by Hiroshi Kanazu for the second game, while Mother 3's score was written by Shogo Sakai.The music has inspired several album releases. Mother saw the release in 1989 of an album primarily composed of vocal arrangements of pieces from its soundtrack; this album was re-released in 2004 in an expanded form. EarthBound had a soundtrack album associated with the game released in 1994 and again in 2004 that contained both original tracks from the game and medleys of multiple tracks. A compilation release, Mother 1+2, received a soundtrack album release in 2003, as well as an album of MIDI piano versions of songs from the two games in 2006. The latest release in the series, Mother 3, has two soundtrack albums: Mother 3+, released in 2006, and the online-only release Mother 3i in 2007.The games' soundtracks have received primarily positive reviews, and the music itself has gone on to some popularity. Multiple piano sheet music books of pieces from the series have been produced, and the \"Eight Melodies\" song originally featured in Mother has been included in some Japanese music textbooks. Music from the series has been used in the Super Smash Bros. series of fighting games, has been played in orchestral game music concerts, and been remixed for websites such as OverClocked Remix. Mother Mother (マザー, Mazā), later re-released as EarthBound Beginnings, is a role-playing video game published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System video game console in 1989. The game's soundtrack was composed by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Tanaka was a video game composer working for Nintendo who had previously composed for games such as Super Mario Land and Metroid, while Suzuki was a composer and musician for bands of many different genres. The \"Mother\" series (Japanese: マザー , Hepburn: Mazā ) consists of three role-playing video games: the 1989 \"Mother\" for the Famicom, the 1994 \"Mother 2\", known as \"EarthBound\" outside of Japan, for the Super NES, and the 2006 \"Mother 3\" for the Game Boy Advance.  Written by Shigesato Itoi and published by Nintendo, and featuring game mechanics modeled on the \"Dragon Quest\" series, the \"Mother\" series is known for its sense of humor, originality, and parody.  Set in a late 20th century United States, the player uses weapons and psychic powers to fight hostile, everyday objects.  Signature elements of the series include the lighthearted plots, the battle sequences with psychedelic backgrounds, and the \"rolling HP meter\": as player health ticks down like an odometer, players can outrun the meter to heal before dying.  While the franchise is popular in Japan, in the United States, it is best associated with the cult following behind \"EarthBound\".   The history of video games spans a period of time between the invention of the first electronic games and today, covering a long period of invention and changes.  Video gaming would not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s, when arcade video games, gaming consoles and home computer games were introduced to the general public.  Since then, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern culture in most parts of the world.  The early history of video games, therefore, covers the period of time between the first interactive electronic game with an electronic display in 1947, the first true video games in the early 1950s, and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s (\"Pong\" and the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles with the Magnavox Odyssey, both in 1972).  During this time there were a wide range of devices and inventions corresponding with large advances in computing technology, and the actual first video game is dependent on the definition of \"video game\" used.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

He later blended with the crowd and waited for his target to appear.While homicide rates are high in the Philippines, mass shootings – particularly school shootings – are not common. However, politically motivated crimes are prevalent. Federico Pascual Jr., a columnist at The Philippine Star, opined that \"the Ateneo incident could be described as a mass shooting\" but the Quezon City police said that the gunman \"was targeting Furigay, with other victims presumably just collateral damage.\" Details  Shooting At around 3:30 p.m. (UTC+08:00), on July 24, 2022, the gunman opened fire outside the university's Areté building, the venue for the graduation ceremony. Rosita Furigay was the main target of the perpetrator. She was killed along with a security guard, Jeneven Bandiala, who was attempting to thwart the gunman, and Victor George Capistrano, Furigay's executive assistant. Hannah Furigay, the former mayor's daughter who was among the graduating students, was injured. Julia Manabat, mother of another graduating student and a nurse, was also injured. The attacker was also wounded by a gunshot fired by security guards of the university.

The University of Washington (UW and informally U-Dub or U Dub) is a public research university in Seattle, Washington, United States. Founded in 1861, the University of Washington is one of the oldest universities on the West Coast of the United States.  The university has a 703-acre (284 ha) main campus located in the city's University District. It also has satellite campuses in nearby cities of Tacoma and Bothell. Overall, UW encompasses more than 500 buildings and over 20 million gross square footage of space, including one of the largest library systems in the world with more than 26 university libraries, art centers, museums, laboratories, lecture halls, and stadiums.Washington is the flagship institution of the six public universities in Washington state. It is known for its medical, engineering, and scientific research. Washington is a member of the Association of American Universities. According to the National Science Foundation, UW spent $1.48 billion on research and development in 2021, ranking it 5th in the nation. Its 22 varsity sports teams compete as the Huskies in the Big Ten Conference of the NCAA Division I, representing the United States at the Olympic Games, and other competitions. History  Founding In 1854, territorial governor Isaac Stevens recommended the establishment of a university in the Washington Territory. Prominent Seattle-area residents, including Methodist preacher Daniel Bagley, saw this as a chance to add to the city's potential and prestige. Bagley learned of a law that allowed United States territories to sell land to raise money in support of public schools. At the time, Arthur A. Denny, one of the founders of Seattle and a member of the territorial legislature, aimed to increase the city's importance by moving the territory's capital from Olympia to Seattle. However, Bagley eventually convinced Denny that the establishment of a university would assist more in the development of Seattle's economy. Two universities were initially chartered, but later the decision was repealed in favor of a single university in Lewis County provided that locally donated land was available. When no site emerged, Denny successfully petitioned the legislature to reconsider Seattle as a location in 1858.In 1861, scouting began for an appropriate 10 acres (4 ha) site in Seattle to serve as a new university campus. Washington State University (WSU) is a public research university in Pullman, Washington, in the Palouse region of the northwest United States. Washington State University (WSU) (or colloquially and informally Wazzu) is a public land-grant research university in Pullman, Washington. Founded in 1890, WSU is also one of the oldest land-grant universities in the American West. With an undergraduate enrollment of 24,278 and a total enrollment of 28,581, it is the second largest institution for higher education in Washington state behind the University of Washington. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". The WSU Pullman campus stands on a hill and is characterized by open spaces and a red brick and basalt material palette—materials originally found on site. The university sits within the rolling topography of the Palouse in rural eastern Washington and remains closely connected to the town and the region. The university also operates campuses across Washington at WSU Spokane, WSU Tri-Cities, and WSU Vancouver, all founded in 1989. In 2012, WSU launched an Internet-based Global Campus, which includes its online degree program, WSU Online. In 2015, WSU expanded to a sixth campus at WSU Everett. These campuses award primarily bachelor's and master's degrees. Freshmen and sophomores were first admitted to the Vancouver campus in 2006 and to the Tri-Cities campus in 2007. WSU's athletic teams are called the Cougars and the school colors are crimson and gray. Six men's and nine women's varsity teams compete in NCAA Division I in the Pac-12 Conference. Both men's and women's indoor track teams compete in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.    History     Agricultural College, Experiment Station, and School of Science   In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act of 1862 into law, allowing for the creation of land-grant colleges “to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts ...in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes.\" The Hatch Act of 1887 expanded on the Morrill Act, providing federal funds for the establishment of agriculture experiment stations at land-grant colleges.

Shortly after attaining statehood on November 11, 1889, the Washington State Legislature began taking steps to claim a land-grant college, and fewer than five months later on March 28, 1890, passed House Bill 90 for the creation of the Agricultural College, Experiment Station and School of Science of the State of Washington. Governor Elisha P. Ferry signed the bill into law a few days later. Soon after, a second act of legislature expanded the school's educational mission to include general arts and sciences. Washington, officially the State of Washington, is the westernmost state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is often referred to as Washington state to distinguish it from the national capital, both named for George Washington (the first U.S. president). Washington borders the Pacific Ocean to the west, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north. The state was formed from the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in the Oregon Treaty of 1846. It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital, and the most populous city is Seattle.Washington is the 18th-largest state, with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,830 km2), and the 13th-most populous state, with more than 7.8 million people. The majority of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry on Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west; mountain ranges in the west, center, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, center, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California. Mount Rainier, an active stratovolcano, is the state's highest elevation at 14,411 feet (4,392 meters), and is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous U.S.Washington is a leading lumber producer; its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the largest producer of apples, hops, pears, blueberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries in the U.S., and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock, livestock products, and commercial fishing—particularly of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish—are also significant contributors to the state's economy.

Ender in Exile is a science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card, part of the \"Ender's Game\" series, published on November 11, 2008.  It takes place between the two award-winning novels: \"Ender's Game\" and \"Speaker for the Dead\".  It could also be considered a parallel novel to the first three sequels in the Shadow Saga, since the entirety of this \"trilogy\" takes place in the span of \"Ender in Exile\".  The novel concludes a dangling story line of the Shadow Saga, while it makes several references to events that take place during the Shadow Saga.  From yet another perspective, the novel expands (or \"replaces\") the last chapter of the original novel \"Ender's Game\".  On the one hand, it fills the gap right before the last chapter, and on the other hand, it fills the gap between the last chapter and the original (first) sequel (both named \"Speaker for the Dead\").  \"Ender in Exile\" begins one year after Ender has won the bugger war, and begins with the short story \"Ender's Homecoming\" from Card's webzine Intergalactic Medicine Show.  Other short stories that were published elsewhere are included as chapters of the novel. Last Exile (ラストエグザイル , Rasuto Eguzairu ) is a Japanese animated television series created by Gonzo.

The next three games (Avernum: Second Trilogy), also by Vogel, were released in 2005, 2007 and 2009 respectively. The latter games are entirely original built on a newer game engine and not a remake of any previous game. The Avernum games, like other Spiderweb Software games, are designed with gameplay and storytelling before graphical elements. In December 2011, a newer version of Avernum has been released, Avernum: Escape from the Pit, followed by its sequels Avernum 2: Crystal Souls in 2015 and Avernum 3: Ruined World in 2018.    Improvements over Exile  The original Exile games used a top-down perspective tile-based graphical system, effectively displayed as an X-Y axis wherein each tile in the grid was filled by a base graphic and perhaps an item or character icon. Avernum features a 45-degree axonometric display that appears three-dimensional. The game also adds varying terrain height, allowing for more interesting map layouts. As the first three games in the series are remakes of the Exile series, the primary plot devices remain relatively unchanged, while many new encounters and side-quests are added. With the design overhaul came improvements to the graphical user interface (GUI) and to the storyline as well. Also Avernum has a maximum of four party members instead of six (with a minor exception of two NPCs in Blades of Avernum). In-game art by Phil Foglio lends a more humorous feel to the game.    Games   The Avernum games take place largely in a subterranean world known as Avernum. The main clash of the game is between the Avernites and the surface kingdom, known as the Empire. The game features several races. The humans are the dominant race in the series, with the Nephilim and Slithzerikai being two other primary races.

The player is then free to train the character in 28 different skills, ranging from melee weapons to arcane lore to first aid. Characters in Avernum 3 have access to over 60 different spells and battle disciplines. These can be spells to inflict damage or summon aid, blessings and curses, and rituals that heal wounded party members. Avernum 3 features elaborate scripted encounters that are intended to encourage a variety of tactics.Avernum 3 features a large world that evolves as time passes. Towns will fall to the monsters and refugees will move from town to town. An open-ended system allows a variety of different playstyles.

Creatures in battle take turns acting, during which they can move, use abilities, and attack. Setting The Avernum series is the third chapter in the Avernum series. It is based in Avernum, a subterranean nation far under the surface of the world. Avernum is a prison, the destination of petty criminals and rebels from the surface. As Avernum 3 begins, the Avernites have found a way to leave the underworld. However, the surface is being ravaged by waves of monsters. If the player can't find a way to end this invasion, there will be no surface world to escape to. Development Jeff Vogel, who does the programming and game design himself, said he did a remake of Avernum III because it was not functioning on modern systems.  He also wanted to port it to newer systems and improve the game design.

Exile is a single-player action-adventure video game originally published for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron in 1988 by Superior Software and later ported to the Commodore 64, Amiga, CD32 and Atari ST, all published by Audiogenic. The game was designed and programmed by Peter Irvin (creator of Starship Command) and Jeremy Smith (creator of Thrust). It is often cited as one of the earliest examples of a Metroidvania game and featured \"realistic gravity, inertia and object mass years before players understood the concept of a physics engine... an astounding level of AI, stealth-based gameplay, a logical ecosystem governing the world's creatures and a teleportation mechanic that feels startlingly like a predecessor to Portal\". Plot The player takes the role of Mike Finn, a leading member of a space-exploration organisation called Columbus Force, who have been ordered to the planet Phoebus as part of a rescue mission. Finn is tasked with abetting Commander David Sprake and the surviving crew of the disabled Pericles ship from a psychotic renegade genetic engineer, Triax (the titular Exile), who appears briefly at the very start of the game removing a vital piece of equipment called a Destinator from Mike's ship, the Perseus. As with Elite, a novella (written by Mark Cullen, with input from the game's authors) was included to set up the story, and to provide some clues as to the nature of the planet Phoebus' environment. The novella implies the events take place some time in the 22nd century. Gameplay The player is tasked with traversing a network of tunnels, collecting and interacting with objects, engaging hostile and friendly creatures, rescuing survivors and ultimately defeating Triax and escaping from Phoebus. Finn has a weapons and jet pack system which may be boosted by finding upgrades. Energy cells must be collected throughout the game to power the weapons and jet pack. Finn has a life-preserving teleport system. When he reaches a point near death he is automatically teleported to a safe location previously designated by the player, or ultimately back to his orbiting spaceship. Consequently, it is still possible to complete the game in many scenarios.Exile permits a degree of nonlinear gameplay – challenges may be overcome in a number of possible orders and not all events have to be completed. The player is awarded points depending on goals achieved and time taken to complete the game.

Gummy bears (German: Gummibär) are small, fruit gum candies, similar to a jelly baby in some English-speaking countries. The candy is roughly 2 cm (0.8 in) long and shaped in the form of a bear. The gummy bear is one of many gummies, popular gelatin-based candies sold in a variety of shapes and colors. History The gummy bear originated in Germany, where it is popular under the name  (gum or gummy bear), or in the diminutive form  ([little] gum or gummy bear). Gum arabic was the original base ingredient used to produce the gummy bears, hence the name gum or gummy. Hans Riegel Sr., a confectioner from Bonn, started the Haribo company in 1920. In 1922, inspired by the trained bears seen at street festivities and markets in Europe through to the 19th century, he invented the Dancing Bear (Tanzbär), a small, affordable, fruit-flavored gum candy treat for children and adults alike, which was much larger in form than its later successor, the Gold-Bear (Goldbär). Even during Weimar Germany's hyperinflation period that wreaked havoc on the country, Haribo's fruit-gum Dancing Bear treats remained affordably priced for a mere one pfennig per pair at kiosks. The success of the Dancing Bear's successor would later become Haribo's world-famous Gold-Bears candy product in 1967. Variations and flavors The success of gummy bears has spawned the production of many other gummy candies made to resemble animals and other objects, such as rings, worms, frogs, snakes, hamburgers, cherries, sharks, penguins, hippos, lobsters, octopuses, apples, peaches, oranges, Ampelmännchen, Smurfs and spiders. Manufacturers offer a range of sizes including bears that weigh several kilograms.In the United States, Haribo gummy bears are sold in five flavors: raspberry (red); orange (orange); strawberry (green); pineapple (colorless); and lemon (yellow). Trolli's bears are most often sold in five flavors in the United States, and in the same colors; however, Trolli's red bear is strawberry-flavored, while the green is lime and the colorless is grape. Many companies emulate either Haribo or Trolli flavor-color combinations. \"Papi\" is a song recorded by American singer Jennifer Lopez for her seventh studio album \"Love? \" (2011).  The Latin-flavored dance song was written by RedOne, AJ Junior, BeatGeek, Teddy Sky, Bilal Hajji and Jimmy Joker, and produced by RedOne, BeatGeak and Jimmy Joker.  The lyrical content of the song revolves around Lopez's love to dance for her man.  The song was due to be released as a promotional single to help promote the album on April 19, 2011, but the song was unlocked and released on April 17, 2011, through a campaign on Lopez's Facebook page.  \"Papi\" received praise from music critics, stating that it was one of the highlights from \"Love?\" .

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Where is the mobile company named Tecno Mobile, who created HiOS, located?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe Mobile Company of America was a U.S. steam automobile manufacturer founded in 1899 by John B. Walker after a fallout with businessman Amzi L. Barber, whose financing had earlier allowed Walker to purchase the now well-known Stanley Steamer concern.  By 1903, the Mobile Company of America was out of business, while Barber's Locomobile Company of America abandoned steam car production in 1901 in favor of petrol-engine vehicles, selling the Stanley brothers back their factory and steam engine patents for $20,000 despite having originally paid $250,000 for the operation. HiOS () is a customized Android operating system developed by Hong Kong mobile phone manufacturer Tecno Mobile, a subsidiary of Transsion Holdings. The OS is used in the company’s smartphones.HiOS claims to allow for a wide range of user customization without requiring rooting of the mobile device. The operating system is bundled with pre-installed utility applications. The company claimed that the applications would allow users to free up memory, freeze applications, and limit data accessibility to applications, among others.

It included new features provided by the original Android 8.1, such as single-handed mode, gesture controls and facial recognition-based security.In April 2019, HiOS 5.0 was released and was based on Android 9.0. It launched on Tecno Spark 3 and Phantom 9. In September 2019, HiOS 5.5 was also released based on Android 9.0 \"Pie\", launching on Tecno Camon 12 and Spark 4.The beta version of HiOS 6.0 was released to Tecno Spark 3 Pro on 1 December 2019. In February 2020, HiOS 6.0 was released and was based on Android 10. It launched on Tecno Camon 15. Like the original Android 10, it allowed system-wide dark theme to be set by the user.In September 2020, HiOS 7.0 was released and was based on Android 10. It launched on Tecno Camon 16 series.In May 2021, HiOS 7.6 was released and was based on Android 11. HiOS, is a customized version of Android mobile operating system developed by Hong Kong based mobile phone company Tecno Mobile.  It allows for a wide range of user customization without requiring rooting the mobile device.  The operating system is also bundled with utility applications that allow users to free up memory, freeze applications, limit data accessibility to applications among others.   Social messaging or social messaging applications or chat applications are instant messaging or mobile messaging (Short Message Service/SMS) clients that are built around social networking platforms.  Some examples of popular social messaging include BlackBerry Messenger, Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, KakaoTalk, Line, WeChat, WhatsApp, Telegram and Viber.  While both require internet connection, social messaging apps differ from traditional IMs because they don't require a computer to use; the chat applications run particularly on smartphone devices, where it challenges other widely used mobile features, such as calling, texting, and emailing.  Chat applications are topping the iOS and Android most downloaded applications lists.  More and more people are upgrading from feature phones to smartphones accelerating the move from traditional calling and SMS (which are paid services) to social messaging (which are generally freemium or subscription-based), to become the dominant way of staying in touch on the phone, because it is generally cheaper to send IM messages via social messaging than to send SMS (via mobile company), not limited to the 140-character limit of SMS, and they have more features than regular texting. The conventional telephone system is in poor condition because it has received little investment in the post-Soviet era.  As of 2007 there were 340,000 telephone lines in use, a ratio of one per 21 people.  Many towns are not connected to the national network.  In the early 2000s, the state telecommunications agency, Tajiktelekom, received international aid to upgrade the telephone system.  In 2007 there were 3.5 million mobile telephones in use, compared with only 47,300 in 2003.  This makes Tajikistan the 90th most cellular-capable country in the world.  Among several cellular networks, the Babilon Mobile Company, a US-Tajik joint venture, claimed to have 40 percent of the market in 2006.  The June 2006 launch of the KazSat communications satellite from Kazakhstan was expected to reduce the dependence of all the Central Asian countries on European and U.S. telecommunications satellites.  Launch of a second KazSat is planned for 2009.  The country's international calling code is 992. Iris Browser was a web browser for Windows Mobile smartphones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) developed by the Torch Mobile company.  The first version of Iris Browser was released in 2008.  It is currently one of only three web browsers designed for portable devices which scores a 100/100 on the Acid3 test. A mobile operating system is an operating system used for smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, smartglasses, or other non-laptop personal mobile computing devices. While computers such as typical/mobile laptops are \"mobile\", the operating systems used on them are generally not considered mobile, as they were originally designed for desktop computers that historically did not have or need specific mobile features. This line distinguishing mobile and other forms has become blurred in recent years, due to the fact that newer devices have become smaller and more mobile unlike hardware of the past. Key notabilities blurring this line are the introduction of tablet computers, light laptops, and the hybridization of the two in 2-in-1 PCs.Mobile operating systems combine features of a desktop computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use, and usually including a wireless inbuilt modem and SIM tray for telephone and data connection. In Q1 2018, over 123 million smartphones were sold (highest ever recorded) with 60.2% running Android and 20.9% running iOS. Not as many as 2012 (1.56 billion), 2023 still had soaring sales, 1.43 billion to be exact with 53.32% being Android. Android alone makes more sales than the popular desktop operating system Microsoft Windows, and in general smartphone use (even without tablets) outnumbers desktop use.Mobile devices, with mobile communications abilities (e.g., smartphones), contain two mobile operating systems – the main user-facing software platform is supplemented by a second low-level proprietary real-time operating system which operates the radio and other hardware. Research has shown that these low-level systems may contain a range of security vulnerabilities permitting malicious base stations to gain high levels of control over the mobile device.Mobile operating systems have majority use since 2017 (measured by web use); with even only the smartphones running them (excluding tablets) having majority use, more used than any other kind of device. Thus traditional desktop OS is now a minority-used kind of OS; see usage share of operating systems. Variations occur in popularity by regions, while desktop-minority also applies on some days in countries such as United States and United Kingdom. Android and iOS currently dominate 80% of the market share of mobile operating systems worldwide.

HarmonyOS (HMOS) (Chinese: 鸿蒙; pinyin: Hóngméng) is a distributed operating system developed by Huawei for smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, smart watches, personal computers and other smart devices. It has a multi-kernel design with dual frameworks: the operating system selects suitable kernels from the abstraction layer in the case of devices that use diverse resources. HarmonyOS was officially launched by Huawei and first used in Honor smart TVs in August 2019. It was later used in Huawei wireless routers, IoT in 2020, followed by smartphones, tablets and smartwatches from June 2021.The operating system was initially based on code from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and the Linux kernel; many Android apps can be sideloaded on HarmonyOS.The next iteration of HarmonyOS known as HarmonyOS NEXT was announced on August 4, 2023. It replaces the OpenHarmony multi-kernel system with its own HarmonyOS microkernel at its core, removes all Android code and supports only apps in its native App format. It is currently in beta testing and is expected to launch in the fourth quarter of 2024. Architecture HarmonyOS is designed with a layered architecture, which consists of four layers; the kernel layer at the bottom provides the upper three layers, i.e., the system service layer, framework layer and application layer, with basic kernel capabilities, such as process and thread management, memory management, file system, network management, and peripheral management.The kernel layer incorporates a subsystem that accommodates multiple kernels, such as the Linux kernel, LiteOS, and HarmonyOS microkernel, catering to diverse smart devices. Depending on the device type, different kernels can be selected; for instance, LiteOS is chosen for low-power devices like watches and IoT devices to execute lightweight HarmonyOS apps, whereas large-memory devices like mobile phones, tablets, and PCs utilize the Linux kernel alongside the OpenHarmony framework for running HarmonyOS apps and the AOSP source code for Android apps. This dual-app framework was replaced with a single-app framework in HarmonyOS Next, supporting only native HarmonyOS apps.The system includes a communication base called DSoftBus for integrating physically separate devices into a virtual Super Device, allowing one device to control others and sharing data among devices with distributed communication capabilities.

They collaborated on the work while interned in the Nazi concentration camp of Theresienstadt (Terezín) around 1943.  The Nazis did not allow it to be performed there. Der Kaiser von Atlantis oder Die Tod-Verweigerung (The Emperor of Atlantis or The Disobedience of Death) is a one-act opera by Viktor Ullmann with a libretto by Peter Kien. They collaborated on the work while interned in the Nazi concentration camp of Theresienstadt (Terezín) around 1943. The Nazis did not allow it to be performed there. The world premiere, presented by the Netherlands Opera at the Bellevue Centre, Amsterdam, took place on 16 December 1975. It was conducted by Kerry Woodward using the first performing edition, which he had been actively involved in preparing. The title is sometimes given as Der Kaiser von Atlantis, oder Der Tod dankt ab, that is, The Emperor of Atlantis, or Death Abdicates, and described as a \"legend in four scenes\" rather than an opera.    Composition history  About 1943, Ullmann and Kien were inmates at the Nazi concentration camp of Theresienstadt (Terezín) when they collaborated on the opera. It was rehearsed at Theresienstadt in March 1944, but the Nazi authorities interpreted the work's depiction of the character of the Kaiser as a satire on Adolf Hitler and did not allow it to be performed. Both the composer and the librettist were murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Prior to his death, Ullmann had expressed that his time in Theresienstadt did not damper his creative drive. This sentiment is confirmed by Ullmann himself:  It should be emphasized that we by no means just sat lamenting by Babylon's rivers and that our will to culture was adequate to our will to live. Ullmann entrusted his manuscripts to a fellow-prisoner, Dr. Emil Utitz, a former Professor of Philosophy at the German University in Prague, who served as the camp's librarian. Utitz survived the camp and passed the manuscripts on to another survivor, Dr. Hans Gunther Adler, a friend of Ullmann's, some of whose poems Ullmann had set to music. The score was a working version with edits, substitutions, and alternatives made in the course of rehearsals. Dr. Adler deposited the original manuscripts and two copies of the libretto in his possession at the Goetheanum in Dornach, the center for the anthroposophical movement with which Ullmann was associated.

Whittaker \"Whit\" Cunliffe (15 December 1875 in Haslingden – 1 May 1966) was an English comic singer known for the outfits worn during his stage performances and his World War I song \"Hoch, Hoch Der Kaiser\" and other songs including \"What Does it Matter to Me? \" (1906) and \"A Different Girl Again\".  Cunliffe was described as being a bit of a dandy. The Kaiser of California, better known as \"The Emperor of California\" (German \"Der Kaiser von Kalifornien\"), is a 1936 film that has the distinction of being the first western film made in Nazi Germany.  Some exterior scenes were even shot on location in the United States at Sedona, Arizona, the Grand Canyon and at Death Valley in California. The Bohemian Girl is a 1936 comedic feature film version of the opera \"The Bohemian Girl\" by Michael William Balfe.  It was produced at the Hal Roach Studios, and stars Laurel and Hardy and Thelma Todd in her last role before her death.  This was also the only appearance of Darla Hood in a full-length feature produced by Hal Roach. Atlantis (Ancient Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος, romanized: Atlantìs nêsos, lit. 'island of Atlas') is a fictional island mentioned in Plato's works Timaeus and Critias as part of an allegory on the hubris of nations. In the story, Atlantis is described as a naval empire that ruled all Western parts of the known world, making it the literary counter-image of the Achaemenid Empire. After an ill-fated attempt to conquer \"Ancient Athens,\" Atlantis falls out of favor with the deities and submerges into the Atlantic Ocean. Since Plato describes Athens as resembling his ideal state in the Republic, the Atlantis story is meant to bear witness to the superiority of his concept of a state.Despite its minor importance in Plato's work, the Atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature. The allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several Renaissance writers, such as Francis Bacon's New Atlantis and Thomas More's Utopia. On the other hand, nineteenth-century amateur scholars misinterpreted Plato's narrative as historical tradition, most famously Ignatius L. Donnelly in his Atlantis: The Antediluvian World. Plato's vague indications of the time of the events (more than 9,000 years before his time) and the alleged location of Atlantis (\"beyond the Pillars of Hercules\") gave rise to much pseudoscientific speculation. As a consequence, Atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction, from comic books to films.While present-day philologists and classicists agree on the story's fictional nature, there is still debate on what served as its inspiration. Plato is known to have freely borrowed some of his allegories and metaphors from older traditions, as he did with the story of Gyges. This led a number of scholars to suggest possible inspiration of Atlantis from Egyptian records of the Thera eruption, the Sea Peoples invasion, or the Trojan War. The Bohemian Girl is an opera composed by Michael Balfe.The Bohemian Girl may also refer to:The Bohemian Girl (1922 film), a British filmThe Bohemian Girl (1936 film), a 1936 feature film version of the operaThe Bohemian Girl (short story), a short story by Willa Cather The Bohemian Girl is a 1922 British romance film directed by Harley Knoles and starring Gladys Cooper, Ivor Novello and C. Aubrey Smith.  It was inspired by the opera \"The Bohemian Girl\" by Michael William Balfe and Alfred Bunn which was in turn based on a novel by Cervantes.  Originally released at 70 minutes, the surviving print is missing the first two reels and small portion of the last, timing at 46 minutes. Der Kaiser von Schexing is a German television series.

The Bohemian Girl is an Irish Romantic opera composed by Michael William Balfe with a libretto by Alfred Bunn.  The plot is loosely based on a Miguel de Cervantes' tale, La gitanilla. The best-known aria from the piece is \"I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls\" in which the main character, Arline, describes her vague memories of her childhood.  It has been recorded by many artists, most famously by Dame Joan Sutherland, and also by the Norwegian soprano Sissel Kyrkjebø and Irish singer Enya.    Performance history  The opera was first produced in London at the Drury Lane Theatre on 27 November 1843.  The production ran for more than 100 nights and enjoyed many revivals worldwide including: New York City (25 November 1844), Dublin (1844) and Philadelphia (1844). Several versions in different languages  were also staged during Balfe's lifetime. The German version, Die Zigeunerin, premiered in Vienna in 1846, the Italian adaptation and translation, titled La zingara, was originally staged in Trieste in 1854, and finally a four-act French version, La Bohémienne, was mounted in Rouen in 1862, conducted by composer Jules Massenet, then aged only 20, and with the celebrated mezzo-soprano Célestine Galli-Marié in the role of the Gypsy Queen. If Die Zigeunerin enjoyed fairly widespread circulation in the countries of German language or culture, La zingara was often revived also in English-speaking cities, such as London, Dublin, New York, Boston and San Francisco. The very successful 1858 run of La zingara at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, for which Balfe was rewarded with an extra cheque for fifty pounds, starred Marietta Piccolomini, Marietta Alboni and Antonio Giuglini. The opera \"remained in the repertories of British touring companies until the 1930s and was revived in 1932 at Sadler's Wells\".

The German version, Die Zigeunerin, premiered in Vienna in 1846, the Italian adaptation and translation, titled La zingara, was originally staged in Trieste in 1854, and finally a four-act French version, La Bohémienne, was mounted in Rouen in 1862, conducted by composer Jules Massenet, then aged only 20, and with the celebrated mezzo-soprano Célestine Galli-Marié in the role of the Gypsy Queen. If Die Zigeunerin enjoyed fairly widespread circulation in the countries of German language or culture, La zingara was often revived also in English-speaking cities, such as London, Dublin, New York, Boston and San Francisco. The very successful 1858 run of La zingara at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, for which Balfe was rewarded with an extra cheque for fifty pounds, starred Marietta Piccolomini, Marietta Alboni and Antonio Giuglini. The opera \"remained in the repertories of British touring companies until the 1930s and was revived in 1932 at Sadler's Wells\". Miloud Hadefi (Arabic: ميلود هدفي‎ ‎ ; March 12, 1949 in Oran – June 6, 1994) was an Algerian football player and manager.  Hedefi represented Algeria in two Football World Cup qualifying matches.  His preferred position was Libero.  He was nicknamed \"the African Kaiser\" by Pelé because of his similar style to German defender \"Der Kaiser\", Franz Beckenbauer. The Bohemian Cafe was located at 1406 South 13th Street in the historic Little Bohemia neighborhood of Omaha, Nebraska.  Established in 1924, the cafe sat next to the Prague Hotel.  Employees dressed in traditional Czech outfits since its early years, and a small cocktail lounge called the Bohemian Girl is adjoined to the restaurant; the interior decoration, similar to the rest of the building, includes hand-painted folk-art pictures.  Omaha native Conor Oberst, the lead singer of the rock act Bright Eyes, has been seen drinking at the bar before performing at the nearby Sokol Auditorium. Maria Bard (7 July 1900 – 8 April 1944) was a German stage actress, who made a handful of films in the silent era for Rimax, her first husband Wilhelm Graaff's company.  By 1930, her marriage with Graaff was over, and she appeared with Werner Krauss in the stage production \"Der Kaiser von Amerika\" or \"The King of America\" and the two became involved.  Unfortunately, Krauss' wife discovered their affair and committed suicide; a year later, in 1931, Maria Bard married Werner Krauss.  Her third husband was actor Hannes Stelzer.  Bard committed suicide on 8 April 1944, apparently for political reasons.  On December 27, 1944, toward the end of World War II, Stelzer who was in the Luftwaffe at this point, died when his plane was shot down over the Eastern front. The Bohemian Girl is a 1936 comedic feature film version of the opera The Bohemian Girl by Michael William Balfe. Directed by James W. Horne and Charles Rogers, and it was produced at the Hal Roach Studios, and stars Laurel and Hardy, and Thelma Todd in her final film role.

When hen-pecked Oliver is out pickpocketing, fortune-telling or attending his zither lessons, his wife (Mae Busch) has an affair with Devilshoof (Antonio Moreno). A cruel nobleman, Count Arnheim (William P. Carleton), persecutes the Gypsies, who are forced to flee, but Mrs Hardy, in revenge for Devilshoof being lashed by the count's orders, kidnaps his daughter, Arline (Darla Hood), and Mrs. Hardy fools Hardy into thinking she is their daughter since he believes everything she tells him. She soon elopes with Devilshoof, and leaves Oliver and \"Uncle\" Stanley holding the toddler. Arline is too young to remember her old life.Twelve years later, the Gypsies return to Arnheim's estate. When grown-up Arline (Jacqueline Wells) accidentally trespasses in Arnheim's garden, she recognises the place and Arnheim's voice, but is arrested by a constable (Jimmy Finlayson) and sentenced to a lashing. Stan and Oliver try to save her, but Stan is too drunk and both are arrested.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION:  Sir William Ewart Bell  was the president of a managing rugby union that has it's home ground at which stadium ?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe Ireland national rugby union team (Irish: Foireann rugbaí náisiúnta na hÉireann) is the men's representative national team for the island of Ireland in rugby union. The team represents both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Ireland competes in the annual Six Nations Championship and in the Rugby World Cup. Ireland is one of the four unions that make up the British & Irish Lions – players eligible to play for Ireland are also eligible for the Lions.The Ireland national team dates to 1875, when it played its first international match against England. Ireland reached number 1 in the World Rugby Rankings for the first time in 2019; the team returned to number 1 for a second time on 18 July 2022 and did not relinquish the top spot until 2 October 2023. Eleven former Ireland players have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame. History  Early years: 1875–1900 Dublin University was the first organised rugby football club in Ireland, having been founded in 1854. The club was organised by students who had learnt the game while at public schools in Great Britain. During the third quarter of the nineteenth century, and following the adoption of a set of official rules in 1868, rugby football began to spread quickly throughout Ireland, resulting in the formation of several other clubs that are still in existence, including NIFC (1868); Wanderers (1869); Queen's University (1869); Lansdowne (1873); Dungannon (1873); County Carlow (1873); UCC (1874); and Ballinasloe (1875) which amalgamated with Athlone to form Buccaneers.In December 1874, the Irish Football Union was formed. Initially, there were two unions: the Irish Football Union, which had jurisdiction over clubs in Leinster, Munster and parts of Ulster and the Northern Football Union of Ireland which formed in January 1875 and controlled the Belfast area. The IRFU was formed in 1879 as an amalgamation of these two organisations, convening for the first time on 5 February 1880.Ireland lost their first test match against England 0–7 at the Oval on 15 February 1875. The Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) (Irish: \"Cumann Rugbaí na hÉireann\" ) is the body managing rugby union in the island of Ireland (both Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland).  The IRFU has its head office at 10/12 Lansdowne Road and home ground at Aviva Stadium, where adult men's Irish rugby union international matches are played.  In addition, the Union also owns Ravenhill in Belfast, Thomond Park in Limerick and a number of grounds in provincial areas that have been rented to clubs.

The IRFU was formed in 1879 as an amalgamation of these two organisations and branches of the new IRFU were formed in Leinster, Munster and Ulster. The Connacht Branch was formed in 1900. The IRFU was a founding member of the International Rugby Football Board, now known as World Rugby, in 1886 with Scotland and Wales. (England refused to join until 1890.) Following the partition of Ireland in to what is now the Republic of Ireland (an independent country) and Northern Ireland (a region of the United Kingdom), the then Committee of the Irish Rugby Football Union decided that it would continue to administer its affairs on the basis of the full 32 Irish counties and the traditional four provinces of Ireland: Leinster (12 counties), Ulster (9 counties), Munster (6 counties), and Connacht (5 counties), as they had been whilst all in the United Kingdom. This led to the unusual, but not unique, situation among international rugby union teams, where the Irish representative teams are drawn from players from two separate political, national territories: Ireland (an independent, sovereign state) and Northern Ireland (a part of the United Kingdom). To maintain the unity of Irish rugby union and the linkages between North and South, the IRFU purchased a new ground in 1923 in the Ravenhill district of Belfast at a cost of £2,300. The last full International at Ravenhill involving Ireland for more than a half-century took place in 1953–54 against Scotland who were victorious by 2 tries (6 points) to nil.

Rugby union (Irish: Aontas Rugbaí) is a popular team sport on the island of Ireland, organised on an all-Ireland basis, including players and teams from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Its governing body, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), was founded in 1879, making it the third oldest rugby union in the world after the RFU (England) and the SRU (Scotland).The Ireland national team is currently third in the World Rugby Rankings, and has won the Six Nations Championship (and its predecessor competitions) fifteen times, most recently in 2024, including four Grand Slams, the most recent being in 2023. Ireland has appeared at every men's Rugby World Cup but never advanced beyond the quarter-final.Ireland has four professional teams, organised by the four provincial unions that make up the IRFU, Leinster, Munster, Ulster and Connacht, who compete in the United Rugby Championship (URC), the European Rugby Champions Cup and the EPCR Challenge Cup. Munster are the most recent Irish team to win the URC in 2022–23, while Leinster are the most successful side historically. Irish provinces have had considerable success in European competition, with seven European Rugby Champions Cups and one Challenge Cup win. At the local level, fifty club sides compete in the five divisions of the All-Ireland League, of which Cork Constitution are the current champions.The Ireland women's rugby union team compete in the Women's Six Nations, WXV and the women's Rugby World Cup, while women's teams from Ireland compete in the IRFU Women's Interprovincial Series and the cross-border Celtic Challenge competition with sides from Scotland and Wales. Governing body The Irish Rugby Football union was formed in 1879, after the merger of the Irish Football Union, which controlled rugby in Leinster, Munster and parts of Ulster, and the Northern Football Union of Ireland, which controlled in the game in the Belfast area. As part of this amalgamation, the IRFU established three provincial branches to run the game in Leinster, Munster and Ulster; a fourth branch was founded for Connacht in 1885. The IRFU was a founding member of the International Rugby Board (now called World Rugby) in 1986. William Ewart Gladstone  ( GLAD-stən; 29 December 1809 – 19 May 1898) was a British statesman and Liberal politician. In a career lasting over 60 years, he was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for 12 years, spread over four non-consecutive terms (the most of any British prime minister) beginning in 1868 and ending in 1894. He also was Chancellor of the Exchequer four times, for over 12 years. Apart from 1845 to 1847, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1832 to 1895 and represented a total of five constituencies.Gladstone was born in Liverpool to Scottish parents. He first entered the House of Commons in 1832, beginning his political career as a High Tory, a grouping that became the Conservative Party under Robert Peel in 1834. Gladstone served as a minister in both of Peel's governments, and in 1846 joined the breakaway Peelite faction, which eventually merged into the new Liberal Party in 1859. He was chancellor under Lord Aberdeen (1852–1855), Lord Palmerston (1859–1865) and Lord Russell (1865–1866). Gladstone's own political doctrine—which emphasised equality of opportunity and opposition to trade protectionism—came to be known as Gladstonian liberalism. His popularity amongst the working-class earned him the sobriquet \"The People's William\".In 1868, Gladstone became prime minister for the first time. Many reforms were passed during his first ministry, including the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland and the introduction of secret voting. After electoral defeat in 1874, Gladstone resigned as leader of the Liberal Party. From 1876 he began a comeback based on opposition to the Ottoman Empire's reaction to the Bulgarian April Uprising. His Midlothian Campaign of 1879–1880 was an early example of many modern political campaigning techniques. After the 1880 general election, Gladstone formed his second ministry (1880–1885), which saw the passage of the Third Reform Act as well as crises in Egypt (culminating in the Fall of Khartoum) and Ireland, where his government passed repressive measures but also improved the legal rights of Irish tenant farmers.Back in office in early 1886, Gladstone proposed home rule for Ireland but was defeated in the House of Commons.

A 2001 profile of the College in The Guardian as part of a article on possible changes to post-primary education in Northern Ireland report as having \"the feel and confidence of a good public school\".In rugby, the college has won both the Ulster Schools Cup and the Medallion Shield a record 37 times outright. The college choirs have won Songs of Praise Choir of the Year, Sainsbury's Choir of the Year and RTÉ All-Island School Choir of the Year. The Chapel Choir has performed in Westminster Abbey and the Carnegie Hall as well as during Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland.Past pupils of the college are known as Old Collegians and the college has a former pupils' organisation that brands itself as Methody Collegians.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: What FIA drag racing class is similar to the Australian Top Doorslammer clas?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nDrag boat racing is a form of drag racing which takes place on water rather than land.  As with land-based drag racing, competitors race their vehicles for the lowest elapsed time (low ET) over a straight race course of a defined length.  There are three standard drag race course lengths, 660 feet (1/8 mile), 1,320 foot (1/4 mile), and the most common length, used in professional drag boat racing, 1,000 feet (3/16 mile plus 10 feet).  Unlike drag racing on land, which begins from a standing start, drag boat racing begins from a short rolling start to a point that cannot be passed until the green \"start\" light illuminates.  There are numerous categories of professional and sportsmen classes based on various engine configuration, fuel type, hull design and propulsion types.  The premier category of drag boat racing being the Top Fuel Hydroplane class which is the water based equivalent to Top Fuel Dragsters capable of covering the liquid quarter mile in less than four seconds with a top speed of around 260 mph (400 km/h).  The biggest event on the drag boat calendar is the LODBRS World Finals which takes place at Firebird Raceway Phoenix, Arizona. Pro Stock Motorcycle, formerly known as Pro Stock Bike is a drag racing class that is the two-wheeled equivalent of Pro Stock.  It has been a feature of NHRA drag racing since the 1980s when it was added to the professional class structure and has since spread around the globe.  Their 1st Points Championship Season took place in the 1987 NHRA Season.  The class has for years been dominated by inline-4 cylinder Suzuki based bikes but in recent years Harley-Davidson based V-twin machines have become more competitive due to favorable rule changes (160 c.i. Harley's vs. 107 c.i Suzuki's, electronic fuel injection on Harley's vs. carburetors for Suzuki.  Frames are purpose-built specifically for drag racing and are not based on their road-going counterparts.

It is similar to the Top Doorslammer class as defined by the ANDRA. Overview   This division has specific rules about engines, components, bodies, etc. Pro Modifieds can either be raced on 1/4 mile or 1/8 mile tracks. Usually, the NHRA races Pro Mod cars on the 1/4 mile, resulting in high 5 to low 6 second passes, while the PDRA races strictly on 1/8 mile track setups, allowing for high 3 second-to low 4 second passes. Despite Pro Modified cars being slower than the Top Fuel or Funny Car classes, it has become one of the most popular divisions of the sport because of being full-bodied cars resembling Pro Stock cars with a hood scoop or superchargers being permitted. The Professional Drag Racers Association's Pro Modified classes are based on which type of boost is used (turbochargers or superchargers in Boost, while nitrous oxide is in Nitrous).  Due to the near-limitless engine/drivetrain combinations and incredibly lenient rule system used by most Pro Modified racing organizations (for example, no manufacturers matching engine and body requirement), competing teams in this series of drag racing have virtually every freedom to make their car as fast and competitive as it can possibly be. The Pro Modified class originated in the UK in 1988, and was followed in the USA by the IHRA a year later. In Europe, Pro Modified moved from the NDRS to become an FIA class in 2006. The off season between the 2009 and 2010 seasons was the most controversial in years. The IHRA, the first sanctioning body to run the class in the USA, dropped the class in a move to focus more on nitromethane powered vehicles. Picking up where the IHRA left off, the NHRA announced that through a partnership with Get Screened America, Pro Mod would become a full-fledged professional class, running a limited schedule but still competing for national event trophies and a world champion. The winningest drivers in US Pro Modified history are Scotty Cannon, Mike Janis and Shannon Jenkins.    Engines  There are 4 different engine combinations available for the Pro Modified category.

Top Doorslammer is a professional (Pro) class of Australian drag racing.  It caters to full-bodied racing sedans which are replicas of Australian or US production vehicles.  The class uses 514 cu.  in.  displacement (8.5 litre), mechanically supercharged V8 engines which are fueled by methanol.  The minimum weight break for these vehicles is 2700 lbs (1225 kg).

It is similar to the Pro Modified class as defined by the NHRA. Top Doorslammer is regulated by ANDRA, and is considered a Group 1 or professional category.  It is the fastest sedan based category in the world, using replicas of front-engined production sedans, coupes, station wagon and utility vehicles usually produced by Holden, Ford, Dodge, Studebaker and Chevrolet. As its name suggests, these cars have operational doors, therefore Funny Car style bodies are not allowed in this class. Some notable drivers competing in this category are John Zappia, Peter Kapiris, Victor Bray, Ben Bray, Gary Phillips, and Maurice Fabietti.  During the summer months, because of rules similar to Pro Modified, such stars in the United States frequently appear during the North American winter during the International Hot Rod Association 400 Thunder series currently.  For example, during the 2017-18 IHRA season, Texan Frankie \"Mad Man\" Taylor drove a second Bray Racing car when the drag strips closed for the winter. Top Doorslammer originally started out as an exhibition class called Wild Bunch with notable pioneers John Zappia and Victor Bray.  After a number of successful years of running the class, ANDRA recognised the class worthy of a professional bracket. Top Doorslammer is a professional (Pro) class of Australian drag racing.

Funny Car is a type of drag racing vehicle and a specific racing class in organized drag racing.  In the United States, the other professional drag racing classes are Top Fuel, Pro Modified, Pro Stock, and Pro Stock Bike.  Funny cars are characterized by having tilt-up fiberglass or carbon fiber automotive bodies over a custom fabricated chassis, giving them an appearance vaguely approximating manufacturers' showroom models.  They also have the engine placed in front of the driver, as opposed to dragsters, which place it behind the driver. Ray Price (June 25, 1937 – December 16, 2015) was an American motorcycle drag racer and is credited as the “Father of the Funnybike\".  He was also a renowned designer, engineer and the first drag racer to be sponsored by Harley-Davidson.  He also developed the first wheelie bar, and the two-speed automatic racing transmission for drag racing motorcycles.  This was the first transmission that enabled the first motorcycle to ever achieve 200 mph and has now become standard in the sport.  Price also created the Pro Fuel drag racing class.  Price is an inducted member of five halls of fame including the American Motorcycle Association Hall of Fame, Sturgis Motorcycle Hall of Fame, the North Carolina Sport Hall of Fame, and the North Carolina Drag Racing Hall of Fame. Santa Pod Raceway, located in Podington, Bedfordshire, England, is Europe's first permanent drag racing venue.  It was built on a disused Second World War air base, (RAF Podington), once used by the 92nd Bomber Group.  The drag racing venue opened at Easter in 1966, and it is now the home of European drag racing and has grown substantially over its 51-year existence.  It hosts both the first and last round of the FIA and FIM/UEM European Drag Racing Championship, along with the British National Drag Racing Championships. The European Drag Racing Championship is a combination of four Drag Racing categories that have competed in six events since 1996. The European Drag Racing Season is held from May to September in four countries; UK, Sweden, Finland and Germany. Each drag race category pairs two drivers that compete against each other and the winner is the racer with the lowest reaction time and elapsed time over a designated destination. The drivers are adjudicated points for their performance at each stage which are tallied for a given season. History  Champions Prior to 2006 the Pro Mod Champion was determined by the winner of the Nordic Drag Racing Series (NDRS), which is part of the Swedish Drag Racing Board.

The race follows a short, straight course from a standing start over a measured distance, most commonly 1⁄4 mi (1,320 ft; 402 m), with a shorter, 1,000 ft (0.19 mi; 304.80 m) distance becoming increasingly popular, as it has become the standard for Top Fuel dragsters and Funny Cars, where some major bracket races and other sanctioning bodies have adopted it as the standard. The 1⁄8 mi (660 ft; 201 m) is also popular in some circles. Electronic timing and speed sensing systems have been used to record race results since the 1960s.The history of automobiles and motorcycles being used for drag racing is nearly as long as the history of motorized vehicles themselves, and has taken the form of both illegal street racing and as a regulated motorsport. History Drag racing started in the 1940s. World War II veterans were prominently involved, and some early drag races were done at decommissioned aircraft bases with landing strips that made them an ideal place for the sport. In 1951, Wally Parks formed the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA). The organization banned the use of nitromethane in 1957, calling it unsafe, in part through the efforts of C. J. Hart; the ban would be lifted in 1963.Several other racing organizations were created over the past several decades, such as the Professional Drag Racers Association (PDRA) founded in 2014.Thanks, in part, to the Discovery series Street Outlaws, fandom for drag racing has seen a resurgence in the past decade. Basics of drag racing  Starting Push starts to get engines running were necessary until the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) mandated self-starters in 1976. After burnouts, cars would be pushed back by crews; this persisted until NHRA required reversing systems in 1980. Don Garlits was the first to do burnouts across the starting line, which is now standard practice. ANDRA Pro Series is the Six Group 1 classes representing the pinnacle of Australian National Drag Racing Association (ANDRA) Championship Drag Racing these include Top Fuel, Top Doorslammer, Top Alcohol, Top Bike, Pro Stock and Pro Stock Motorcycle.  They compete across the country at venues in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland culminating at the championship finals at Willowbank Raceway at Ipswich in Queensland traditionally over the Queen's birthday long weekend in June.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

The band's live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart; although Reznor is in complete creative control of Nine Inch Nails in-studio, he typically assembles groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for live performances. The current lineup features Reznor and keyboardist Atticus Ross (an official member since 2016 and session contributor since 2004), alongside touring members guitarist Robin Finck (who first joined in 1994), bassist Alessandro Cortini (who first joined in 2005), and drummer Ilan Rubin (who first joined in 2008). Although band members typically have a defined main role, many of them are multi-instrumentalists during performances. History Nine Inch Nails was founded by multi-instrumentalist Trent Reznor in 1988. The band's first tour was in support of Skinny Puppy that same year. The band's initial lineup included Reznor on vocals and guitar, Chris Vrenna on keyboards, programming, and percussion, and Ron Musarra on drums. These shows were not very well received and Nine Inch Nails departed after only a handful of dates. For the next tour, which started in late 1989, Musarra was replaced on drums by Vrenna, and the lineup was expanded with guitarist Richard Patrick and a new keyboardist. The first keyboardist was designer Gary Talpas, though he was soon replaced by Nick Rushe, and then by David Haymes in January 1990. Lee Mars replaced Haymes on keyboards later on in 1990.Vrenna departed halfway through a tour in 1990, and he was replaced by Jeff Ward. For the 1991 Lollapalooza tour, the band was joined by James Woolley, replacing Mars on keyboards. Vrenna returned on drums in 1992, and in 1994 for the Self Destruct Tour, Danny Lohner and Robin Finck joined as bassist and guitarist respectively (although both members handled other instruments as well). Charlie Clouser also replaced Woolley as keyboardist by December 1994. Kevin McMahon eventually replaced Finck as guitarist for a handful of dates in 1996.For nearly three years, the band was restricted to the studio, until 1999's Fragility Tour. Golden Smog is a loosely connected group of musicians comprising, at various times, members of Soul Asylum, The Replacements, Wilco, The Jayhawks, Run Westy Run, The Honeydogs and Big Star.

Pirner had been fascinated by trains since he was a kid, having watched Casey Jones, the American Western series about the adventures of railroad engineer Casey Jones and the crew of the Cannonball Express steam locomotive. Pirner would use a runaway train as a metaphor for the depression that was spinning out of control. The first line, \"Call you up in the middle of the night\" would refer to a friend of Pirner who lived in New York and was kind enough to answer him on the phone, no matter what time it was. After a practice-room tape was presented to various labels in New York, Columbia Records was most interested. The song was then recorded with producer Michael Beinhorn. Pirner told in an interview with The Guardian, \"If the vocal on it sounds world-weary, it’s because he made me sing it 100 times.\" The band's drummer, Grant Young, was replaced during the session by Sterling Campbell. Then keyboards were put on the track in a studio in LA by Booker T from the MGs. The discography of American rock band Soul Asylum consists of 11 studio albums, two live albums, five compilation albums, two extended plays (EPs), 22 singles, and 17 music videos. Formed in 1981 in Minneapolis, Minnesota using the name Loud Fast Rules, the band's original lineup consisted of vocalist Dave Pirner, guitarist Dan Murphy, bassist Karl Mueller, and drummer Pat Morley.  The band changed their name to Soul Asylum prior to the release of \"Say What You Will... Everything Can Happen\" in 1984.  Later that year, Morley was replaced on drums by Grant Young. The Saturday Night Live Band (referred to in the closing credits as The Live Band) is the house band of the NBC television program Saturday Night Live (SNL). Role on Saturday Night Live The band consists of mostly jazz, R&B, and some rock musicians and features a strong horn section. They normally play the opening theme music (after the cold opening), musical pieces in between commercial breaks, and the closing theme music \"Closing Theme (Waltz in A),\" written by founding member Howard Shore. Often, the band will provide the music to a sketch when necessary. Band leaders and musical directors Musician and future Academy Award winning film composer Howard Shore was the original musical director and bandleader from 1975 until 1980.Singer and songwriter Kenny Vance (who appeared previously as a musical guest on the May 21, 1977 episode) became the musical director for the show's sixth season (1980–81). Original band member and trombonist Tom Malone took over leadership duties under executive producer Dick Ebersol's tenure from 1981 to 1985. Hall & Oates guitarist G.E. Smith came on board as the new musical director once original producer Lorne Michaels returned and stayed in that position until 1995 when lead saxophonist Lenny Pickett was promoted as bandleader.Katreese Barnes also served as the music director for a time, around the year 2000.Keyboardist Leon Pendarvis (who has been a member of the band since 1980) is also 2nd musical director alongside Pickett. Other projects Mariah Carey utilized the horn section of the Saturday Night Live Band (Lew Delgatto, Lenny Pickett, George Young, Earl Gardner, and Steve Turre) for her performance of \"If It's Over\" during her 1992 MTV Unplugged special.Tom Malone, Lou Marini, and Alan Rubin were members of the Blues Brothers band fronted by SNL cast members John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. They were also featured in the first Blues Brothers movie, with Malone as a member of fictional lounge act \"Murph and the Magic Tones,\" Rubin as maitre d' of an expensive French restaurant, and Marini as a fry cook at Aretha Franklin's soul food restaurant. Grant Young (born January 5, 1963, in Iowa City, Iowa) was the drummer for the alternative rock band Soul Asylum from 1984–1995.  He replaced Pat Morley shortly after the release of Soul Asylum's debut album, \"Say What You Will, Clarence...Karl Sold the Truck\" in 1984.  Young's last appearance on a Soul Asylum record album was the breakthrough album, \"Grave Dancers Union\".  He was replaced in the middle of the recording sessions by Sterling Campbell, who has also since left the band and is primarily associated with David Bowie, as part of his touring bands. Black Gold: The Best of Soul Asylum is a compilation album that contains 19 of the greatest hits from Soul Asylum. The discography of American alternative rock band Soul Asylum consists of 12 studio albums, two live albums, five compilation albums, two extended plays (EPs), 22 singles, and 17 music videos. Formed in 1981 in Minneapolis, Minnesota using the name Loud Fast Rules, the band's original lineup consisted of vocalist Dave Pirner, guitarist Dan Murphy, bassist Karl Mueller, and drummer Pat Morley. The band changed their name to Soul Asylum prior to the release of Say What You Will... Everything Can Happen in 1984. Later that year, Morley was replaced on drums by Grant Young.The band released two studio albums for Twin/Tone Records in 1986, Made to Be Broken and While You Were Out, as well as the cassette-only Time's Incinerator, a collection of B-sides, outtakes, and demos. Having a loyal and growing fan base, along with positive reviews from alternative rock critics, Soul Asylum signed with A&M Records in 1988. They recorded the Clam Dip & Other Delights EP for European release, followed by the full-length Hang Time in 1988. Produced by Lenny Kaye and Ed Stasium, Hang Time was well-received on college radio but the follow-up album, And the Horse They Rode in On (1990), was a critical and commercial disappointment, resulting in the band being dropped by A&M.Soul Asylum signed with Columbia Records and released Grave Dancers Union in 1992. The album's first single, \"Somebody to Shove\", went to number one on the Modern Rock chart, and \"Black Gold\" also received significant airplay on radio and MTV. \"Runaway Train\" crossed over to the pop charts, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1993 and winning the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song's music video, directed by Tony Kaye, features photos of missing children and was adapted for several international markets. \"Runaway Train\" peaked at number one in Canada and reached the top 10 in the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The song's success helped Grave Dancers Union achieve double-platinum certification by Music Canada and by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States.The band's seventh album, Let Your Dim Light Shine (1995), peaked at number six in the US and in Canada.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Which Hawaii Democrat, and first American Samoan of the Unites States Congress, sponsored the \"Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2017\"? \n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe Fetus Farming Prohibition Act of 2006 (Pub.L.  109–242 , 120 Stat.  570–571 , enacted  19, 2006 ) is an Act of the United States Congress that was sponsored by Republican Senators Rick Santorum, Sam Brownback, Richard Burr and Jeff Sessions, and signed by President George W. Bush.  It is an amendment to the Public Health Service Act (). During Tulsi Gabbard's tenure as a congresswoman and presidential candidate, she placed much emphasis on her foreign policy views and regarded them as inseparable from her domestic policy views. She criticizes what she terms the \"neoliberal/neoconservative war machine\", which pushes for US involvement in \"wasteful foreign wars\". She has said that the money spent on war should be redirected to serve health care, infrastructure, and other domestic priorities. Nevertheless, she describes herself as both a hawk and a dove: \"When it comes to the war against terrorists, I'm a hawk\", but \"when it comes to counterproductive wars of regime change, I'm a dove\".As a candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Gabbard's political positions were broadly similar to those of contenders on health care, climate, education, infrastructure, and criminal justice reform, but she had distinguishable positions on issues ranging from Democratic Party internal politics to foreign affairs.After ending her presidential campaign, Gabbard has since taken more conservative positions on culture war and social issues, including abortion and transgender rights. Gabbard endorsed the controversial Florida House Bill 1557, referred to by critics as the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, and in 2022, she was a featured speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). She has been a frequent critic of the Biden administration. Later in 2022, she announced that she had quit the Democratic Party without joining any other party. Vernon Huber (August 28, 1899 – June 17, 1967) was a United States Navy Rear admiral, and the 36th Governor of American Samoa from April 22, 1947 to June 15, 1949.  He was born in Philadelphia, Illinois, and was appointed to the United States Naval Academy from that state.  He served as the first commanding officer of the USS \"Livermore\" (DD-429) upon its launch in 1940.  After his appointment, he advocated the diversification of the American Samoan economy.  He also helped to increase the level American Samoan self-government, and was the first governor to serve alongside a Samoan legislature, the American Samoa Fono. The 2020 presidential campaign of Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district, began on January 11, 2019. In January 2020, she was polling at about 1 to 2 percent. Had she won, she would have become the first female, Hindu, and Samoan president in American history, and the youngest person to ever hold the office. She made reducing military activity abroad a central message of her campaign.On March 19, 2020, Gabbard dropped out of the 2020 election and endorsed Joe Biden. Background Gabbard had been a rising figure in the Democratic Party in the lead-up to the 2016 election cycle, when she served as Vice-Chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).Gabbard appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast in both September 2018 and November 2020, the latter along with Jocko Willink. On October 19, 2018, Politico reported that Gabbard was \"weighing a 2020 presidential bid\" but would not make an announcement until after the 2018 midterm elections. On December 12, 2018, Gabbard said on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews that she was \"seriously considering\" running for president in 2020. Democratic primary campaign  Launch On January 11, 2019, in an interview with CNN's Van Jones, Gabbard confirmed her intention to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. On January 24, she formally launched her campaign by releasing a video on her website.The following week, NBC News notified the Gabbard campaign they would be publishing a story the week after her campaign kickoff rally, where NBC would assert Gabbard was supported by the \"Russian propaganda machine\". Instead, NBC released the story two hours before her campaign kickoff in Hawaii on February 2. Glenn Greenwald criticized NBC for relying on a firm that had previously tried to imitate \"an elaborate 'false flag' operation\" that would plant the idea that Alabama Senatorial candidate Roy Moore was being supported by a \"Russian botnet\".Shortly after the announcement, campaign manager Rania Batrice and consulting firm Revolution Messaging departed from the campaign. Politico reported that sources \"familiar with the campaign\" referred to Gabbard as \"indecisive and impulsive\". Ann Lee (b. 1929/1930(age –) ) is a Houston, Texas woman who founded Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition (RAMP), a conservative American group in favor of legalization of cannabis.  She has stated \"prohibition is not conservative\" and compared it to the unconstitutional Jim Crow laws of the American South.  Lee is anti-abortion, voted for Donald Trump, and never smoked cannabis.  Lee's group has been active at both in the state of Texas and at the federal level advocating legalization. House Resolution 1227, \"Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2017\", is a U.S. United States House resolution introduced during the 115th Congress.  It would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act Schedule I, and eliminate Federal restricitons on cannabis possession and sale, other than interstate transfers.  It was initially sponsored by Thomas Garrett Jr., a Virginia Republican, and cosponsored by Scott Taylor, also a Virginia Republican, and Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat.  It is reintroduced legislation from 2015, when it was known as S. 2237.  Other Representatives who joined as cosponsors included Justin Amash, a Michigan Republican.  On April 20, 2017, activists from D.C. Cannabis Campaign distributed 1,227 joints made from 1 lb of cannabis to members of congress to urge consideration of the bill.

She was also a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee until February 28, 2016, when she resigned to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.  Elected in 2012, she is the first American Samoan and the first Hindu member of the United States Congress.  She served in a combat zone in Iraq.  Gabbard (then known as Tulsi Gabbard Tamayo) served in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 2002 to 2004, becoming at age 21 the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature at the time. Tulsi Gabbard ( TUL-see GAB-ərd; born April 12, 1981) is an American politician, United States Army Reserve officer, and political commentator who was the U.S. representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district from 2013 to 2021. Gabbard was the first Samoan-American to become a voting member of Congress. She was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election, before announcing in October 2022 that she had left the Democratic Party to become an independent. In 2002, Gabbard was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives at the age of 21. Gabbard served in a field medical unit of the Hawaii Army National Guard while deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was stationed in Kuwait from 2008 to 2009 as an Army Military Police platoon leader. While a member of Congress, she served as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) from 2013 to 2016, and resigned to endorse Bernie Sanders' campaign for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. During her time in Congress, she frequently appeared on Fox News and criticized the Barack Obama administration for refusing to say that the real enemy of the United States is radical Islam or Islamic extremism. During her presidential campaign, she highlighted an opposition to military interventionism, although she has called herself a \"hawk\" on combatting terrorism. Her decision to meet Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and her skepticism of claims that he had used chemical weapons gave rise to public disagreement from mainstream Democrats. In March 2020, Gabbard ended her presidential candidacy, and endorsed Joe Biden. Since leaving the House of Representatives on January 3, 2021, Gabbard has taken more conservative positions on issues such as abortion, foreign policy, transgender rights, and border security. She has continued her frequent presence on Fox News, including serving as a fill-in host for Tucker Carlson Tonight. In October 2022, Gabbard announced that she had left the Democratic Party altogether, citing their positions on foreign policy and social issues as reasons for her departure.

Microscopy is the technical field of using microscopes to view objects and areas of objects that cannot be seen with the naked eye (objects that are not within the resolution range of the normal eye). There are three well-known branches of microscopy: optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopy, along with the emerging field of X-ray microscopy.Optical microscopy and electron microscopy involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams interacting with the specimen, and the collection of the scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning a fine beam over the sample (for example confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). Scanning probe microscopy involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the object of interest. The development of microscopy revolutionized biology, gave rise to the field of histology and so remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences. X-ray microscopy is three-dimensional and non-destructive, allowing for repeated imaging of the same sample for in situ or 4D studies, and providing the ability to \"see inside\" the sample being studied before sacrificing it to higher resolution techniques. A 3D X-ray microscope uses the technique of computed tomography (microCT), rotating the sample 360 degrees and reconstructing the images. CT is typically carried out with a flat panel display. A 3D X-ray microscope employs a range of objectives, e.g., from 4X to 40X, and can also include a flat panel. History The field of microscopy (optical microscopy) dates back to at least the 17th-century. Earlier microscopes, single lens magnifying glasses with limited magnification, date at least as far back as the wide spread use of lenses in eyeglasses in the 13th century but more advanced compound microscopes first appeared in Europe around 1620 The earliest practitioners of microscopy include Galileo Galilei, who found in 1610 that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects close up and Cornelis Drebbel, who may have invented the compound microscope around 1620. The Bureau of Prohibition (or Prohibition Unit) was the federal law enforcement agency formed to enforce the National Prohibition Act of 1919, commonly known as the Volstead Act, which elaborated upon the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution regarding the prohibition of the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages.  When it was first established in 1920, it was a unit of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.  On April 1, 1927, it became an independent entity within the Department of the Treasury, changing its name from the \"Prohibition Unit\" to the \"Bureau of Prohibition\".  In 1930, it became part of the Department of Justice.  By 1933, with the Repeal of Prohibition imminent, it was briefly absorbed into the FBI, or \"Bureau of Investigation\" as it was then called, and became the Bureau's \"Alcohol Beverage Unit,\" though, for practical purposes it continued to operate as a separate agency.  Very shortly after that, once Repeal became a reality, and the only federal laws regarding alcoholic beverages being their taxation, it was switched back to Treasury, where it was renamed the Alcohol Tax Unit. Cannabis in American Samoa is completely illegal, and the American Samoan government advises that there is a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment and/or $5000 fine for possession of any amount of illegal drugs, including marijuana, even if prescribed legally in another jurisdiction.  Legislation mandating the minimums passed in the Territory in 1999, with one man receiving a 5-year sentence without probation or parole for one count marijuana possession that October. Lambert v. Yellowley, 272 U.S. 581 (1926) , was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that reaffirmed the National Prohibition Act's limitation on the dispensation of alcoholic medicines.  The five-to-four decision, written by Justice Louis D. Brandeis, affirmed the dismissal of a suit in which New York City physician Samuel Lambert sought to prevent Edward Yellowley, the acting federal prohibition director, from enforcing the Prohibition Act so as to preclude him from prescribing alcoholic medicines.  The decision affirmed the police powers of the individual states, as well as the power of the Necessary and Proper Clause of the United States Constitution, which was cited in upholding the Prohibition Act's limitations as a necessary and proper implementation of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act is a series of federal marijuana decriminalization bills that have been introduced multiple times in the United States Congress. Several authors have put forth arguments concerning the legality of the War on Drugs.  In his essay \"The Drug War and the Constitution\", Libertarian philosopher Paul Hager makes the case that the War on Drugs in the United States is an illegal form of prohibition, which violates the principles of a limited government embodied in the Constitution.  Alcohol prohibition required amending the Constitution, because this was not a power granted to the federal government.  Hager asserts if this is true, then marijuana prohibition should likewise require a Constitutional amendment. The Republic of Texas was annexed into the United States and admitted to the Union as the 28th state on December 29, 1845.The Republic of Texas declared independence from the Republic of Mexico on March 2, 1836. It applied for annexation to the United States the same year, but was rejected by the United States Secretary of State. At that time, the majority of the Texian population favored the annexation of the Republic by the United States. The leadership of both major U.S. political parties (the Democrats and the Whigs) opposed the introduction of Texas — a vast slave-holding region — into the volatile political climate of the pro- and anti-slavery sectional controversies in Congress. Moreover, they wished to avoid a war with Mexico, whose government had outlawed slavery and refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of its rebellious northern province. With Texas's economic fortunes declining by the early 1840s, the President of the Texas Republic, Sam Houston, arranged talks with Mexico to explore the possibility of securing official recognition of independence, with the United Kingdom mediating.In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, then unaligned with any political party, decided independently to pursue the annexation of Texas in a bid to gain a base of support for another four years in office. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for the emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the U.S. Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844. Pro-Texas-annexation southern Democratic delegates denied their anti-annexation leader Martin Van Buren the nomination at their party's convention in May 1844. In alliance with pro-expansion northern Democratic colleagues, they secured the nomination of James K. Polk, who ran on a pro-Texas Manifest destiny platform.In June 1844, the Senate, with its Whig majority, soundly rejected the Tyler–Texas treaty. Later that year, the pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: What title does George Sanders and Shere Khan have in common?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nGeorge Henry Sanders (3 July 1906 – 25 April 1972) was a Russian-born English film and television actor, singer-songwriter, music composer, and author.  His career as an actor spanned more than 40 years.  His upper-class English accent and bass voice often led him to be cast as sophisticated but villainous characters.  He is perhaps best known as Jack Favell in \"Rebecca\" (1940), Scott Folliott in \"Foreign Correspondent\" (1940) (a rare heroic part), Addison DeWitt in \"All About Eve\" (1950), for which he won an Academy Award, King Richard the Lionheart in \"King Richard and the Crusaders\" (1954), Mr. Freeze in a two-parter episode of \"Batman\" (1966), the voice of the malevolent man-hating tiger Shere Khan in Disney's \"The Jungle Book\" (1967), and as Simon Templar, \"The Saint\", in five films made in the 1930s and 1940s. George Henry Sanders (3 July 1906 – 25 April 1972) was a British actor and singer whose career spanned over 40 years. His heavy, upper-class English accent and smooth, baritone voice often led him to be cast as sophisticated but villainous characters. He is remembered for his roles as wicked Jack Favell in Rebecca (1940), Scott ffolliott in Foreign Correspondent (1940, a rare heroic part), The Saran of Gaza in Samson and Delilah (1949, the most popular film of the year), theater critic Addison DeWitt in All About Eve (1950, for which he won an Oscar), Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert in Ivanhoe (1952), King Richard the Lionheart in King Richard and the Crusaders (1954), Mr. Freeze in a two-part episode of Batman (1966), and the voice of Shere Khan in Disney's The Jungle Book (1967). He also starred as Simon Templar, in 5 of the 8 films in The Saint series (1939–41), and as a suave Saint-like crimefighter in the first 4 of the 16 The Falcon films (1941–42).    Early life  Sanders was born on 3 July 1906 in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, at number 6 Petrovski Ostrov, to rope manufacturer Henry Sanders and horticulturist Margaret (née Kolbe), who was also born in Saint Petersburg, of mostly German, but also Estonian and Scottish ancestry. (Sanders wrote of his mother's descent from \"the Thomas Clayhills of Dundee, who went to Estonia in 1626 to establish a business there\".) Sanders referred to his parents as \"well-off\" and noted his mother's \"forebears of solid social position and impeccable respectability\", stating that \"to the best of (his) knowledge, (his) father came in the mail\". A biography published in 1990 alleged that family members' \"recent disclosures... indicate\" that Sanders' father was the out-of-wedlock son of a Russian noblewoman of the Tsar's court, and a prince of the House of Oldenburg who was married to a sister of the Tsar.

According to The Kipling Society, the word \"Shere\" (or \"\"shir\"\") translates as \"tiger\" and \"Khan\" is a title of distinction, used together \"to show that he is chief among tigers.\"  Other sources indicate \"Shere\" may mean \"tiger\" or \"lion\" in Persian, Urdu, and Punjabi, and that \"Khan\" translates as \"king\", or \"leader\", in a number of languages influenced by the Mongols, including Pashto and Urdu.  The name may have originated from the nickname of the Afghan origin King who once ruled in India, Sher Shah Suri. Shere Khan (Hindi- शेर खान/ English pronunciation) is a fictional Bengal tiger in Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book and its adaptations, in which he is often portrayed as the main antagonist, itself an exaggeration of his role in the original stories, which he only appears in a third of. The name roughly translates as tiger ruler, with shere (Persian: شیر, pronounced [ʃeːɾ]) being the Persian word for 'tiger'), and khan being used as a title of distinction among the Turco-Mongol peoples, usually meaning chief or ruler. According to The Kipling Society, the name \"show[s] that he is the chief among tigers\". Shere Khan is named after Afghan Emperor Sher Shah Suri.    The original Jungle Book stories  Shere Khan is depicted by Kipling with being born with a crippled leg and was derisively nicknamed \"Lungri\" (\"The Lame One\") by his mother. Despite this condition, Shere Khan is prideful and regards himself as the \"rightful\" lord of the jungle. The only creature who looks up to him is Tabaqui, a spineless and hated golden jackal. In \"Mowgli's Brothers\", Shere Khan's failed attempt to hunt humans causes a human \"cub\" to stray from its parents. When Shere Khan discovers the infant, it has been adopted by Indian wolves, Raksha and Father Wolf, who have named the child Mowgli. Mowgli is accepted into Akela's wolf pack and is protected by Bagheera (a panther) and Baloo (a bear). Furious at losing his kill, the tiger swears that the boy will be his some day. While Mowgli is growing up, Shere Khan infiltrates the wolf pack by promising the younger wolves rich rewards once Akela is deposed. When the young wolves manoeuvre Akela into missing his kill, the pack council meets to kill and replace him. Shere Khan threatens to take over their hunting territory if the wolves don't give him Mowgli. Having been warned by Bagheera, Mowgli attacks Shere Khan and his allies with a burning branch (the mysterious and powerful \"red flower\" of man) and drives them away. Akela leaves the pack to become a lone hunter.

It was released on the Columbia label in 1985 and was Shorter's first solo album since 1974.  The recording is notable in Shorter's body of work both for its relative lack of improvisation and for the high level of its compositions and group arrangements.  Brazilian and Funk rhythms are featured on several tracks, as is a mixture of electric and acoustic instrumentation.  The composition \"Shere Khan, the Tiger\" was previously recorded by a group including Shorter and Carlos Santana on the latter's 1980 album The Swing of Delight.  Several of the compositions on this album would continue to feature in Shorter's repertoire well into 2012, most notably the title piece.  The cover art for the album is a pastel portrait of Shorter by actor Billy Dee Williams.  Compositionally, \"Atlantis\" is noteworthy due to the inclusion of unusual intervallic melodies and a sense of economy and space generated through the use of parallel dominant 9th suspended chords coupled with contrapuntal bass lines.  This approach is exemplified by the composition \"On the Eve of Departure\" which programmatically resembles \"When worlds Collide\", the George Pal Sci-Fi classic. Death of a Scoundrel is a 1956 film written, directed and produced by Charles Martin and starring George Sanders, Yvonne De Carlo, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Victor Jory and Coleen Gray.

Most of these games were played at the Queen's Park (now part of the City Botanic Gardens (see image at right).

These fields may include but are not limited to: business, politics, academia, entertainment, sports, religion, and health care, similar to cronyism. The term originated with the assignment of nephews, sons, or other relatives to important positions by Catholic popes and bishops. It has often been witnessed in autocracies, whereby traditional aristocracies usually contested amongst themselves in order to obtain leverage, status, etc.Nepotism has been criticized since ancient history by several philosophers, including Aristotle, Valluvar, and Confucius, condemning it as both evil and unwise. Origins The term comes from Italian word nepotismo, which is based on Latin root nepos meaning nephew. Since the Middle Ages and until the late 17th century, some Catholic popes and bishops – who had taken vows of chastity and, therefore, usually had no legitimate offspring of their own – gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to sons.Several popes elevated nephews and other relatives to the cardinalate. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal \"dynasty\". For instance, Pope Callixtus III, head of the Borgia family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming Pope Alexander VI. Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become Pope Paul III.Paul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally limited when Pope Innocent XII issued the bull Romanum decet Pontificem, in 1692.

The Office is an American mockumentary sitcom television series based on the 2001–2003 BBC series of the same name created by (and starring) Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Adapted for NBC by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for Saturday Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons, the show depicts the everyday work lives of office employees at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, and aired from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, with a total of nine seasons consisting of 201 episodes. The show was co-produced by Daniels' Deedle-Dee Productions and Reveille Productions (later Shine America), in association with Universal Television. The original executive producers were Daniels, Gervais, Merchant, Howard Klein and Ben Silverman, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.Like its British counterpart, the series was filmed in a single-camera setup without a studio audience or a laugh track, to mirror the look of an actual documentary. It debuted on NBC as a mid-season replacement and ended its nine-season run on May 16, 2013, with a two-part series finale. Its original main cast was Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, and B. J. Novak. It experienced numerous changes to its ensemble cast during its run. Notable stars outside the original main cast include Ed Helms, Rashida Jones, Amy Ryan, Mindy Kaling, Craig Robinson, James Spader, Ellie Kemper, and Catherine Tate.The Office received moderately positive reviews from critics (except for the pilot episode which received mixed reviews) during its short first season, but the following seasons, particularly Carell's performance, received significant acclaim from television critics as the show's characters, content, structure, and tone diverged considerably from the original British series. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards including a Peabody Award in 2006, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for Carell's performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards, including one for Outstanding Comedy Series, in 2006. The eighth season was criticized for a decline in quality, with Carell's departure in season seven seen as a contributing factor. However, the ninth and final season ended the series with a generally positive response. The sixth season of the American television comedy The Office premiered in the United States on NBC on September 17, 2009, and concluded on May 20, 2010. The season consisted of 22 half-hour episodes, and 2 hour-long episodes to comprise the 26 total episodes of material created. The Office is an American adaptation of the British TV series, and is presented in a mockumentary format, portraying the daily lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The season stars Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, B. J. Novak, and Ed Helms, with supporting performances from Leslie David Baker, Brian Baumgartner, Creed Bratton, Kate Flannery, Mindy Kaling, Ellie Kemper, Angela Kinsey, Paul Lieberstein, Oscar Nunez, Craig Robinson, and Phyllis Smith.The season has been cited by several critics as weaker than earlier seasons, despite still receiving generally favorable reviews. The season ranked fifty-second in the season ratings with an average of 7.80 million viewers per episode, marking a steep drop in the ratings from the previous season which had an average of nine million viewers.The sixth season of The Office aired on Thursdays at 9:00 p.m. (Eastern) in the United States. The season was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Universal Studios Home Entertainment in a four-disc box set in the Region 1 area on September 7, 2010. The DVD set contains all 26 episodes, as well as commentaries from creators, writers, actors, and directors on some of the episodes. It also contains deleted scenes from all of the episodes, as well as bloopers. Production The sixth season of the show was produced by Reveille Productions and Deedle-Dee Productions, both in association with Universal Media Studios. The show is based upon the British series created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, both of whom are executive producers on both the US and UK versions. The Office is produced by Greg Daniels, who is also an executive producer. Daniels would have a limited role in this season, only co-writing an episode and directing another, as he was busy writing his new show, Parks and Recreation which he co-created with Office writer/producer Michael Schur, who left the writing staff of The Office after season four to focus on the new show.

Most of the top competitors by 1998 were now openly professional.The competitions took place on the following days:Pairs: 8–10 February 1998Men's singles: 12–14 February 1998Ice dance: 13–16 February 1998Ladies' singles: 18–20 February 1998Exhibition gala: 21 February 1998 Medal summary  Medalists  Medal table  Participating NOCs Thirty-five nations competed in the figure skating events at Nagano. Results  Men The favourites and top two after the short program were Ilia Kulik and Elvis Stojko, who would skate first and last, respectively. Medal contenders Alexei Yagudin, Todd Eldredge and Philippe Candeloro went in between. Steven Cousins was the other skater in the final draw, but he was not considered to have a realistic chance of making the podium.Kulik skated a flawless program which included a quad toe loop to open the last session. Yagudin, who was one of several athletes suffering from the flu during these games, fell on his quad attempt and his triple Axel, which took him out of medal contention. Eldredge was skating cleanly until he popped what was to be his second triple Axel, and then he fell again when he tried to complete the jump again in the closing seconds. Candeloro, with the exception of a step out on his triple Axel, skated his program flawlessly to end up second in the free skating. Stojko, who skated last, originally intended to perform a quad toe loop/triple toe loop combination. However, a partial groin tear and the flu prevented him from attempting the combo, so he downgraded his quad to a triple. The 2010 FIA WTCC Race of the Czech Republic (formally the 2010 FIA WTCC Monroe Race of the Czech Republic) was the seventh round of the 2010 World Touring Car Championship season and the fifth running of the Race of the Czech Republic.  It was held at the Masaryk Circuit near Brno, Czech Republic on 1 August 2010.  The two races were won by Robert Huff of Chevrolet RML and Andy Priaulx of BMW Team RBM.

Figure skating was first contested in the Olympic Games at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Since 1924, the sport has been a part of the Winter Olympic Games.Men's singles, ladies' singles, and pair skating have been held most often. Ice dance joined as a medal sport in 1976 and a team event debuted at the 2014 Olympics. Special figures were contested at only one Olympics, in 1908. Synchronized skating has never appeared at the Olympics but aims to be included. History Figure skating was first contested as an Olympic sport at the 1908 Summer Olympics, in London, United Kingdom. As this traditional winter sport could be conducted indoors, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved its inclusion in the Summer Olympics program. It was featured a second time at the Antwerp Games, after which it was permanently transferred to the program of the Winter Olympic Games, first held in 1924 in Chamonix, France.In London, figure skating was presented in four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's special figures, and mixed pairs. The special figures contest was won by Russian Nikolai Panin, who gave his country its first ever Olympic gold medal. He remains the event's sole winner, as it was subsequently dropped from the program.Ice dance joined as a medal sport in 1976, after appearing as a demonstration event at Grenoble 1968.A team event debuted at the 2014 Olympics. It consists of two segments: qualification and finals. During qualification each team has one men's single skater, one ladies' single skater, one pair, and one ice dance couple skate their short program/dance. Before the finals, each team is allowed to replace up to two skaters/couples. The final consists of each skater/couple skating their free program/dance. Results are determined by placement points. Summary  Qualifying The number of entries for the figure skating events at the Olympic Games is limited by a quota set by the International Olympic Committee. There are 30 participants in each singles events (ladies and men), 20 pairs, and 24 ice dance duos.In the past, skaters must represent a member nation of the International Skating Union and reach the age of fifteen before July 1 of the previous year. After the previous 2022 Olympic Games, this rule has changed and the new age requirement by the next Olympics will be 17-years-old.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Which Canadian mine hasn't been confirmed to exist, Beanland Mine or Lost Lemon Mine?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nBeanland Mine, also known as Clenor Mine, is an abandoned surface and underground mine in Northeastern Ontario, Canada.  It is located about 1 km west of Arsenic Lake and 4 km northwest of the town of Temagami in central Strathy Township.  It is named after Sydney Beanland, who first claimed the mine site in the 1920s and was a director for the mine from 1937 to 1938. Beanland Mine, also known as Clenor Mine, is an abandoned surface and underground mine in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. It is located about 1 km (0.62 mi) west of Arsenic Lake and 4 km (2.5 mi) northwest of the town of Temagami in central Strathy Township. It is named after Sydney Beanland, who first claimed the mine site in the 1920s and was a director for the mine from 1937 to 1938. Mining operations began at Beanland in the mid-1930s when the Temagami area was the scene of very active prospecting and mining ventures. Gold and silver were the mine's primary commodities. Active mining operations on the site ceased in the late 1930s, but mineral exploration has occurred there periodically since. Mineral exploration at Beanland remained idle from the early 1970s to the early 1990s as a result of a land claim dispute applied by Temagami First Nations. However, exploration resumed shortly after the dispute was withdrawn in the early 1990s. The mine consists of a 3-compartment vertical shaft, an open pit, lateral workings, a waste rock dump and various structures from pre-existing buildings. Basalt and andesite are the primary rock types at Beanland, forming part of the Younger Volcanic Complex, the site's major geological feature. A zone of deformation intersects the local basaltic bedrock, which is the location of several minerals.    History     Background  Beanland Mine is named after Sydney Beanland, a Canadian prospector who first claimed the site in 1929. It was one of the four gold mines in Strathy Township that were in operation during the 1930s. The others were Manitoba and Eastern Mine, Cuniptau Mine and Hermiston-McCauley Mine, all of which were closed by 1938. They were part of a prospecting/mining boom that began in the 1930s and continued until the 1940s. This was one of the most active prospecting and mining scenes in the Temagami area during the 20th century. Beanland correlates with some of the earliest gold mining in the Temagami area, which continued sporadically from a number of other mines until the 1970s. It was mined both as a primary and secondary product at surface and underground mines.

The Northland Pyrite Mine, also known as James Lake Mine, Rib Lake Mine, Harris Mine or simply Northland Mine, is an abandoned underground mine in Northeastern Ontario, Canada, located on the southwestern shore of James Lake in Best Township of Temagami.  It was operated by the Northland Mining Company during the early 1900s with the construction of a 91 m shaft and many open-cuts north of the shaft.  Minerals present at the mine include chalcopyrite, pyrite and pyrrhotite, deposited in Precambrian volcanic rock of the Canadian Shield. On 13 May 2014, an explosion at a coal mine in Soma, Manisa, Turkey, caused an underground mine fire, which burned until 15 May.  In total, 301 people were killed in what was the worst mine disaster in Turkey's history.  The mine, operated by coal producer Soma Kömür İşletmeleri A.Ş. , suffered an explosion, the cause of which is still under investigation.  The fire occurred at the mine's shift change, and 787 workers were underground at the time of the explosion.  After the final bodies were pulled from the mine on May 17, 2014, four days after the fire, the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Taner Yıldız confirmed the number of dead was 301.  Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) announced the names of 301 workers who died in the mine disaster and 486 people who survived but some politicians claimed that the number of dead is more than 340. The Dvoinoye Gold Mine is an underground gold mine in the Bilibinsky District of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia.  The mine is owned by Canadian mining company Kinross Gold and is approximately 100 km from their Kupol Gold Mine.  Originally the site of a surface mine, Kinross acquired the property in 2010, and built the underground mine at a cost of US$360-million.  The mine began production in 2013. The \"lost mine\" is a popular form of lost treasure legend. Although there are countless examples around the world, several common themes can be traced throughout the various legends. Usually the mines are said to contain valuable elements or minerals such as gold, silver or diamonds. Often there is a map or other document allegedly detailing the history or location of the mine. Common to all the lost mine legends is the idea of a valuable and mysterious resource being lost to history. Some lost mine legends have a historical basis, and some have none. Regardless, the lure of these legends is attested by the many books on the subject, and the popularity of publications such as Lost Treasure magazine.

The Victor Diamond Mine is the first Canadian diamond mine located in Ontario, and De Beers' second diamond mine in Canada (after the Snap Lake Diamond Mine).  It is located in the Northern Ontario Ring of Fire, in the James Bay Lowlands 90 km west of Attawapiskat in the remote northern part of the province.  In June 2005, the Attawapiskat First Nation voted in favour (85.5%) of ratifying the Impact Benefit Agreement (IBA).  Construction of the mine began in February 2006 which created 3200 positions; mining and operations will create around 400 permanent positions.  The Victor Mine is an open-pit mine, with a processing plant, workshops, and an airstrip located on site.  By 2013-2014 royalties collected from De Beers Victor Diamond Mine amounted to $226.  At that time De Beers was continuing to pay off its \"$1 billion investment to build the mine and from now until it closes, the company expects to pay tens of millions of dollars in royalties.\" The Williamson Diamond Mine (also known as the Mwadui mine) is a diamond mine 23 km northeast of Shinyanga in Tanzania; it became well known as the first significant diamond mine outside of South Africa.  The mine was established in 1940 by Dr. John Williamson, a Canadian geologist, and has been continuous operation since then, making it one of the oldest continuously operating diamond mines in the world.  Over its lifetime it has produced over 19 million carats (3,800 kg) of diamonds.  The Williamson mine, once owned by its namesake Dr. Williamson and later nationalized by the government of Tanzania.  Since February 2009 the mine is mostly owned by Petra Diamonds, with 75% ownership, the government of Tanzania owning the remaining 25%.  Kayelekera uranium mine is an open cast uranium mine 52 kilometers west of the regional administrative and commercial centre Karonga in Malawi, Africa and is the country's largest mine.  Kayelekera is owned 100% by Paladin (Africa) Limited (PAL), an 85% subsidiary of Australian and Canadian listed Paladin Energy and in July 2009, Paladin issued 15% of the equity in Paladin (Africa) Ltd to the Government of Malawi under the terms of the Mining Development Agreement signed between PAL and the Government in February 2007.  The mine was officially opened on 17 April 2009 by the then Malawian president Bingu wa Mutharika.  As of 2014, the mine is in care and maintenance mode owing to a depressed uranium market.  While in production, the mine exported containers of uranium oxide via the port of Walvis Bay.  The mine has not been profitable for its operators and has met opposition from organisations and individuals concerned about the mine's tax concessions, operation, adherence to law and regulation and its potential impacts on human and environmental safety. The Milne-Sherman Road is a concrete road in Northeastern Ontario, Canada, located about 2 km north of the town of Temagami.  It has its connection with Highway 11 and is the main road that allows access to the abandoned Milne Townsite, as well as the abandoned Sherman Mine.

Situated in Phyllis Township, the mine produced 34,000,000 dollars Canadian with 80 million pounds of copper, 230,028 ounces of silver and 13,271 ounces of gold.  It was considered to be the largest deposit of nearly pure chalcopyrite ever discovered in Canada.  A mill was not initially needed because the ore was 28% copper.  The mine closed in 1972 and is now flooded by water.  Ruins of the Copperfields mill are present as foundations.  It is possible to find mineral specimens in the spoil heaps of the old mine, such as chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite, malachite, dolomite, hessite, merenskyite, millerite, palladium, quartz and others.  The Lake Temagami Access Road was created to ship ore from the mine site.

List of episodes \"Albert Ostman Bigfoot Tale\" – in 1924, Albert Ostman, a Scandinavian lumberjack, chose a wild area at the head of Toba Inlet on the Powell River for a combination vacation-prospecting trip. He was searching for a lost gold mine nearby. He heard about the rumored giant Sasquatch, a name which means \"wild men of the woods,\" from an old Indian hired to take him up the fjord. These hairy humanlike creatures carried him off, and held him captive for 7 days.\"The Hutchison Effect\" – In 1979, Hutchison claims to have discovered a number of unusual phenomena, while trying to duplicate experiments done by Nikola Tesla. He refers to several of these phenomena jointly under the name \"the Hutchison effect\", including: levitation of heavy objects; fusion of dissimilar materials such as metal and wood; while lacking any displacement, the anomalous heating of metals without burning adjacent material; the spontaneous fracturing of metals; changes in the crystalline structure and physical properties of metals; disappearance of metal samples.\"Manipogo\" – Manipogo, the name given to a lake monster, reported to live in Lake Manitoba, Manitoba, Canada. Sightings of this serpent like sea monster have been going on since roughly 1908. The creature was dubbed Manipogo in 1957, the name echoing British Columbia's Ogopogo.\"Memphre of Magog Quebec\" – Inland sea serpents are not unknown of in Canada. The story of the Memphe resembles very closely that of Ogopogo in central BC. Lake Memphremagog is a long finger-like running south from Magog, Quebec (near Sherbrooke) across the Canada/US border to about Newport, Vermont. Nestled in between mountains, the lake is both deep and cold. In the latter part of the 18th century stories of encounters by Indians with a giant sea creature began to emerge.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

After winning a national championship with Michigan State in 1979, Johnson was selected first overall in the 1979 NBA draft by the Lakers, leading the team to five NBA championships during their \"Showtime\" era. Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted HIV, but returned to play in the 1992 All-Star Game, winning the All-Star MVP Award. After protests against his return from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32 games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time. Known for his extraordinary court vision, passing abilities, and leadership, Johnson was one of the most dominant players of his era. His career achievements include three NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, three NBA Finals MVPs, nine All-NBA First Team designations, and twelve All-Star games selections. He led the league in regular season assists four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game in both the regular season (11.19 assists per game) and the playoffs (12.35 assists per game). He also holds the records for most career playoff assists and most career playoff triple-doubles. Johnson was the co-captain of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\"), which won the Olympic gold medal in Barcelona.

They have been named national champions twice in the Coaches Poll (1952 and 1965).  The Spartans have also won two Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association championships (1903 and 1905) and nine Big Ten championships (1953, 1965, 1966, 1978, 1987, 1990, 2010, 2013, and 2015). Magic Johnson Theatres is a chain of movie theaters, originally developed in 1994 by Johnson Development Corporation, the business holding of basketball player-turned-entrepreneur Magic Johnson, and Sony Pictures Entertainment through a partnership with Sony-Loews Theatres.A 1998 merger between Sony-Loews and Cineplex Odeon Corporation caused them to become part of the new Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corp. Magic Johnson worked with Lawrence Ruisi, President and CEO of Loews Cineplex Entertainment, during the planning and development of these theaters. Currently the chain's former locations are owned by AMC Theatres, after Sony-Loews was acquired by that company in 2006.  Although they are still branded Magic Johnson Theatres, they are solely controlled by AMC.Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson, Jr., is no longer actively involved in the management committee, strategic planning, operations, or public relations. History The focus of Magic Theatres was to build first-rate multiplexes in urban communities, bringing high quality facilities and technology, as well as job development, encouraging local economic growth. While Magic Theatres are patterned after the Loews Cineplex Entertainment model, they focus on urban markets. Each complex is around 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2) with multiple concession areas, 10 to 15 screens with SDDS stereo sound, stadium seating and a capacity of 3,200 to 5,000. After building the Magic Theatre in Harlem, multiple businesses followed suit including Old Navy, Disney, and HMV.There are/were two multiplex theatres in, or near, major cities of the United States of America, namely in areas which are predominantly African-American and previously were underserved by modern cineplexes.Johnson brought his understanding of the community to his theater operations.  In his concessions he planned on his customers eating their dinner with the movie adding chicken wings and buffalo shrimp to the selection.  Flavored sodas were added to emulate the Kool-Aid the kids he grew up with would drink at home.\"Used to be we couldn't afford to go to dinner and the movie afterward.  I told Loews 'Black people are going to eat dinner at the movies'\"No gang colors or \"hanging out\" in large groups was permitted in the theaters.  Johnson would personally appear before each movie:\"So we got a few policies that apply to everyone.  They are not meant to disrespect.

The team completed its inaugural season with a 0–1 record.  The Sooners played their first football game in history against a town team from Oklahoma City and lost by a final score of 34–0.

Michael Joseph Stoops (born December 13, 1961) is an American football coach and former player.  He is currently the defensive coordinator at the University of Oklahoma.  Stoops served as the head football coach at the University of Arizona from 2003 until his firing during the 2011 season.  He previously served as an assistant coach at the University of Iowa, Kansas State University, and Oklahoma.  He is the younger brother of Bob Stoops, the former head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners football program, and the older brother of Mark Stoops, head coach at the University of Kentucky. In American football, the 5–2 defense is a defensive alignment consisting of five down linemen and two linebackers. 5–2 Eagle Linebackers also may play on the line of scrimmage, hold up offensive ends, and still cover their pass zones when the quarterback fades to pass. This defensive scheme was employed with great success by Coach \"Greasy\" Neale of the Philadelphia Eagles' professional football team.Historically, there are two significant variations of the 5–2 defense in professional and college football. The first is the defense created by Earle (Greasy) Neale. This defense was prominent in the National Football League from the late 1940s through the middle 1950s and was a precursor defense to Buddy Ryan's 46 defense. Paul Brown describes the defense as having a tight five man line, and linebackers who were to jam offensive ends as they came off the line. Brown goes on to say that the use of four defensive backs was innovative at the time. By 1950, the base defense of NFL teams were five man line defenses, either the 5–2 Eagle or the 5–3–3.The 5–2 Eagle has a (passing) hole in the middle of the defense, usually dealt with by having outside linebackers jam the ends. Offenses countered by using slotbacks instead of tight ends. Consequently, teams began to experiment, around 1954, with pulling the middle guard back a couple yards and putting him in a two-point stance. The success of the New York Giants in 1956 with their base 4–3 defense led to a rapid conversion to the 4–3 in 1957. Almost all teams switched to the new defense at that time.Note that in this defense, if you pull the middle guard and replace him with a middle linebacker, you get to an early version of the 4–3 defense. Conversely, if you take a 4–3 defense and replace the middle linebacker with a middle guard, then you convert a 4–3 into a 5–2 Eagle. This latter switch was historically significant in at least one game. The 1984 Oklahoma Sooners football team represented the University of Oklahoma in the college football 1984 NCAA Division I-A season.  Oklahoma Sooners football participated in the former Big Eight Conference at that time and played its home games in Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium where it has played its home games since 1923.

Located in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, it sits on the southern shore of an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean, the Ria de Vigo, the southernmost of the Rías Baixas. It is the capital of the comarca of Vigo.The municipality, with an area of 109.06 km2 (42.11 sq mi) and a population of 292,374 in 2022 including rural parishes, is the most populous municipality in Galicia. The area of the municipality includes the Cíes Islands, part of the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park.Vigo is one of the region's primary economic agents, owing to the French Stellantis Vigo Plant and to its port. Close to the Portugal–Spain border, Vigo is part of the Galicia–North Portugal Euroregion. The European Fisheries Control Agency is headquartered in Vigo. History In the Early Middle Ages, the small village of Vigo was part of the territory of Galician-speaking neighbouring towns, particularly Tui, and suffered several Viking attacks. However, its number of inhabitants was so small that, historically, it was not considered a real town until around the 15th century, when the earliest records began.In the 16th and 17th centuries, the city was attacked several times. In 1585 and 1589, during an unsuccessful attack by the English counter-Armada, Francis Drake raided the city and temporarily occupied it, burning many buildings. Several decades later a Turkish fleet tried to attack the city. As a result, the city's walls were built in 1656 in the reign of Philip IV of Spain. The Ordesa Valley is a glacial valley in Aragon, in the Spanish Pyrenees which forms part of the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park. It was first discovered in 1820, but not mapped in detail until approximately the 1920s. The valley is about 11 kilometres (7 mi) long.The valley's east–west orientation, unusual in the Pyrenees, opens it to influence from the Atlantic Ocean and gives it a moderate climate. It has one of Europe's largest populations of the Pyrenean Chamois and is well known for its waterfalls and wildlife.Monte Perdido (3,355 m) is the third highest mountain in the Pyrenees and together with Cilindro de Marboré (3,328 m) and Soum de Ramond (3,263 m) can be seen at the north-east end of the valley. The name Monte Perdido (lost mountain) was given because the peak could not be seen from the French side of the range. References \"Ordesa\". Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana.

Monte Perdido (in Spanish; Mont Perdu in French; Mont Perdito in Aragonese; all three meaning lost mountain) is the third highest mountain in the Pyrenees. The summit of Monte Perdido (3355 m), located in Spain, lies hidden from France by the seemingly impenetrable peaks of the Cirques of Gavarnie and Estaubé. It stands in the north of Huesca province. The mountain forms part of the Monte Perdido Range and is located in the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, in the western part of the Pyrenees, in the community of Aragon, Spain. Description Monte Perdido Glacier, located on the north-facing slope of Monte Perdido, is the third-largest glacier in the Pyrenees. It is surrounded by vertical cliffs up to 800m in height. Similar to most European glaciers, the Monte Perdido Glacier has been shrinking since the Little Ice Age, and since 1981, the glacier has lost 48 hectares of surface area. The rate of retreat is continuing to accelerate due to the effects of global climate change.Access to the mountain is easier from Spain than from France. The route starts near the village of Torla, Aragon, at the Ordesa Valley and ascends the Cirque de Soaso towards the Refuge of Góriz before the stiff climb to the summit. It is a dangerous climb with snow. National park Monte Perdido is the centrepiece of the Spanish Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park which was established in 1918 with just 21 square kilometres/hectares of land. In the 1970s work began to build a dam in the nearby Añisclo Canyon with the objective of creating hydroelectric energy but institutions and citizens demonstrated against this and succeeded in stopping it. In 1982 the park was expanded significantly to 156 square kilometres/hectares and now incorporates the whole of the Añisclo Canyon. There are more than 1,500 species of flowers, 171 species of birds, 32 different mammals and 8 types of reptile in the Ordesa. Among these is the lammergeier (bearded vulture) with a 3-metre wingspan. Malkumba-Coongie Lakes National Park is a protected area located in the north-east of South Australia about 110 km north-west of Innamincka.  The national park was proclaimed on 31 March 2005 as the Coongie Lakes National Park under \"National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972\" over a parcel of land previously part of the Innamincka Regional Reserve to \"conserve significant wetlands, provide experiences for visitors and ensure that the core component of the Coongie Lakes system was protected.\"  The national park is located on land that was included on the List of Wetlands of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention under the name, Coongie Lakes in 1987.  In 2014, the national park was renamed as the Malkumba-Coongie Lakes National Park.  The national park is co-managed by the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources (DEWNR), the Yandruwandha Yawarrawarrka Parks Advisory Committee and South Australian Arid Lands Natural Resources Management Board.  It is classified as an IUCN Category II protected area. Monte Perdido (in Spanish; Mont Perdu in French; Mont Perdito in Aragonese; Mont Perdut in Catalan, all four meaning \"lost mountain\") is the third highest mountain in the Pyrenees.  The summit of Monte Perdido (3355 m), located in Spain, lies hidden from France by the seemingly impenetrable peaks of the Cirques of Gavarnie and Estaubé.  It stands in the north of Huesca province.  The mountain forms part of the Monte Perdido Range and is located in the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, in the western part of the Pyrenees, in the community of Aragon, Spain. The Cinca (] ; ] , ] ; Aragonese: \"A Cinca\" , ] ) is a river in Aragon, Spain.  Its source is in the Circo de Pineta, in the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, in the Aragonese Pyrenees.  It is a tributary to the Segre River, with its confluence at La Granja d'Escarp, not far from the point where the Segre flows into the Ebro River.  The Cinca River flows through a rich agricultural region. The Ordesa Valley is a glacial valley in Aragon, in the Spanish Pyrenees which forms part of the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park.  It was first discovered in 1820, but not mapped in detail until approximately the 1920s.  The valley is about 11 km long. The Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park (Galician: \"Parque Nacional das Illas Atlánticas de Galicia\" , Spanish: \"Parque Nacional de las Islas Atlánticas de Galicia\" ) is the only national park located in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain.  It comprises the archipelagos of Cíes, Ons, Sálvora and Cortegada.  The park covers a land area of 1200 ha and a sea area of 7200 ha .  It is the tenth most visited national park in Spain.  It was the thirteenth national park to be established in Spain. The Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park (Galician: Parque Nacional das Illas Atlánticas de Galicia, Spanish: Parque Nacional de las Islas Atlánticas de Galicia) is the only national park located in the province of Pontevedra, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. It comprises the archipelagos of Cíes, Ons, Sálvora and Cortegada. The park covers a land area of 1,200 ha (3,000 acres) and a sea area of 7,200 ha (18,000 acres). It is the tenth most visited national park in Spain. It was the thirteenth national park to be established in Spain. Since 2021 it has been designated as a protected Ramsar site.    Geography   The islands of the park are located in the continental platform of the Galician Rías Baixas. The archipelagos of Cortegada and Sálvora are located in the inner and outer areas of the Ría de Arousa, respectively. The Ons archipelago, formed mainly by the Ons and Onza islands, are located at the entrance of the Ría de Pontevedra. Similarly, the Cíes Islands surround the entrance of the Ría de Vigo and comprise the islands Monteagudo, Montefaro and San Martiño. The 8,480 ha of the national park are distributed as follows:    Geology   The geological history of the islands dates back to the Palaeozoic era, when the geological materials which currently form the land and marine areas of the park were formed. The geological composition of the Archipelagos of Cíes, Ons and Sálvora is of granitic nature, although in the first two the predominant parent rock is two-mica gneiss-granite, while in Sálvora the predominant material is coarse-grained amphibole-biotite late granodiorite. Cortegada, meanwhile, presents a composition that is predominantly of metamorphic rock shale and paragneiss, with migmatic granite.    Climate  Although located in a region of oceanic climate, most of the islands of the park present a sub-humid mediterranean climate of Atlantic tendency. Rain is less abundant than in the nearby coast due to the low altitude of the islands, which represents a minimal obstacle for passing clouds. The Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park (Galician: Parque Nacional das Illas Atlánticas de Galicia, Spanish: Parque Nacional de las Islas Atlánticas de Galicia) is the only national park located in the province of Pontevedra, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain.

The Cíes Islands are an archipelago off the coast of Pontevedra in Galicia (Spain), in the mouth of the Ria de Vigo.  They belong to the parish of San Francisco de Afora, in the municipality of Vigo.  They were declared a Nature Reserve in 1980 and are included in the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park (\"Parque Nacional Marítimo-Terrestre das Illas Atlánticas de Galicia\") created in 2002. The Grotte Casteret, also known by its Spanish name Gruta Helada de Casteret, is a limestone ice cave, located high in the Spanish Pyrenees, within the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park.  Discovered in 1926 by Norbert Casteret, it is known for its Grande Salle (Great Hall) which has a frozen lake some 2000 m2 in area, its ice formations, and a 20 m ice wall into a second chamber. The Cíes Islands (Galician: Illas Cíes; Spanish: Islas Cíes) are an archipelago off the coast of Pontevedra in Galicia, Spain, in the mouth of the Ria de Vigo. They were declared a Nature Reserve in 1980 and are included in the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park (Parque Nacional Marítimo-Terrestre das Illas Atlánticas de Galicia) created in 2002. The archipelago The Cíes consist of three islands, Monteagudo (\"Sharp Mount\" or North Island), do Faro (\"Lighthouse Island\", or Illa do Medio, \"Middle Island\") and San Martiño (\"Saint Martin\" or South Island).Monteagudo is separated from the Morrazo peninsula by the North Canal while San Martiño is separated from the coast of Santoulo cape (mount Ferro) by the Freu da Porta Strait. The Do Faro island is linked to the North island by an accumulation of sand 1,200 m (3,937 ft) long known as Rodas beach, in the eastern side of the island. During high tide the sea flows between the islands in the western side and, blocked by the beach it fills the lagoon between the sandy area and the rocks. The highest peak is the Alto das Cíes (197 m (646 ft)) in Monteagudo.The islands formed by the end of the Tertiary, when some parts of the coast sank, creating the rías (\"estuaries\"). All three islands are the peaks of the coastal mountains now partially under the sea and are formed mainly of granitic rock.The land is mountainous with rough, nearly vertical cliffs of more than 100 m (328 ft) on the western side, and numerous caves (furnas) formed by erosion from the sea and the wind. The eastern side is less steep, covered by woods and bushes and protected from the Atlantic winds, allowing the formation of beaches and dunes.Atlantic squalls pass over the islands, unloading as they collide with the coast. Therefore, the Cíes receive more or less half the quantity of rain as the rest of the Rías Baixas. Nature reserve Due to the high natural value of this area and to the deterioration it was suffering by human activity, it was declared a Nature Reserve in 1980.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "answer": "The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Which dog breed is used as a gundog in hunting, the Seppala Siberian Sleddog or the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe German Wirehaired Pointer is a medium to large-sized griffon type breed of dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for versatile hunting.  It became a leading gun dog in Germany in the later part of the 20th century. It is the result of the careful mixing and crossing of the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, German Shorthaired Pointer, German Roughhaired Pointer, and the hunting Pudelpointer in the late 19th century. Description  Appearance The German Wirehaired Pointer is a well muscled, medium to large-sized dog of distinctive appearance. Balanced in size and sturdily built, the breed's most distinguishing characteristics are its weather resistant, wire-like coat and its facial furnishings. Typically pointer in character and style, the German Wirehaired Pointer (GWP) is an intelligent, energetic and determined hunter. The tail is typically docked to two-fifths of the natural length. In countries where docking is prohibited the tail should be of sufficient length to reach down to the hocks. Like all German pointers, they have webbed feet. This dog can have a similar appearance and therefore is sometimes confused with the Spinone Italiano, Český Fousek, or Wirehaired Pointing Griffon. Coat The functional wiry coat is the breed's most distinctive feature. A dog must have a correct coat to be of correct type. The coat is weather resistant and water-repellent. The undercoat is dense enough in winter to insulate against the cold but is so thin in summer as to be almost invisible. The distinctive outer coat is straight, harsh, wiry and flat lying, and is from one to two inches in length. The outer coat is long enough to protect against the punishment of rough cover, but not so long as to hide the outline of the dog. On the lower legs the coat is shorter and between the toes it is of softer texture. On the skull the coat is naturally short and close fitting. Over the shoulders and around the tail it is very dense and heavy. The tail is nicely coated, particularly on the underside, but devoid of feather. Eyebrows are of strong, straight hair. Beard and whiskers are medium length. The hairs in the liver patches of a liver and white dog may be shorter than the white hairs. A short smooth coat, a soft woolly coat, or an excessively long coat is to be severely penalized when showing. The German Wirehaired Pointer is a medium to large-sized griffon type breed of dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for hunting.  It became a leading gun dog in Germany in the later part of the 20th century.  It is the result of the careful mixing and crossing of the griffon, German Shorthaired Pointer,Deutscher Stichelhaar, Deutscher Kurzhaar, and the hunting Pudelpointer in the late 19th century. A rare working dog breed, the Seppala Siberian Sleddog is developed for the purpose of pulling a sled in cold country.  It is a moderate-sized dog averaging 18 to 23 kg (40 to 50 pounds) weight and 56 to 58 cm (22 or 23 inches) height.  Colours and markings are considered of little importance; eyes may be brown, blue or any combination of the two colours.  Seppalas are active and energetic but very docile and trainable.   The West Siberian Laika or \"WSL\", is a breed of hunting dog and a breed of spitz type.  Russian publications indicate that the term West Siberian Laika loosely applied to hunting dogs originating with the Mansi and Khanty people in Ural and West Siberia, but there were no standards or registrations of WSL as such until 1930.  Then WWll disrupted it for a while, but \"systematic breeding with registrations\" resumed after the war ended, in 1946.  This was the time the breed began taking modern shape.  Before that hunters only knew of Mansi Laika and Khanty Laika.  In early 1960 many hunters in Ural still preferred the term Mansi Laika, when speaking of West Siberian Laika.  In Russian language, the term Laika originated from the word \"layat\" that means to bark.  The word Laika simply means \"barker\".  Any hunting Laika is a bark pointer (pointing at animal of interest by barking and staying with the animal ).  It is a versatile dog depending on use and environment, but in certain parts of the country they have become more specialized. Leonhard \"Sepp\" Seppala (September 14, 1877 – January 28, 1967) was a Norwegian-born American Sled dog musher who played a pivotal role in the 1925 serum run to Nome and participated in the 1932 Winter Olympics.  Seppala introduced the work dogs used by Native Siberians at the time to the American public; the breed came to be known as the Siberian Husky in the English-speaking world.  The Leonhard Seppala Humanitarian Award, which honors excellence in sled dog care is named in honour of him. Griffon is a type of dog - a collection of breeds that were originally hunting dogs.  There are three lines of the griffon type recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI): the griffon vendéens, the wirehaired pointers, and the \"smousje\" (Belgian companion dogs or Dutch Smoushond).  The griffon type is characterized by rough or wire-hair. Griffon is a type of dog, a collection of breeds that were originally hunting dogs. There are three lines of the griffon type recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI): the Griffon Vendéens, the wirehaired pointers, and the smousje (Belgian companion dogs or Dutch Smoushond). The griffon type is characterized by rough- or wire-hair.The griffon is mentioned as early as Xenophon. The hounds, Canis Segusius, used by the Gauls were griffons. Among the oldest breeds are the Italian Wirehaired Pointing Dog or Spinone Italiano (FCI #165) and the breeds bred by Eduard Karel Korthals originating in the Low Countries (Belgium, Netherlands, northern France) which have a short, bearded muzzle. The dog, the Korthals Griffon, known as the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working sled dog breed. The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia for sled pulling and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain. Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet, though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushers. Lineage In 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog. In North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with European breeds. Siberian Huskies show a genetic affinity with historical East Siberian dogs and ancient Lake Baikal dogs, and can be traced to a lineage which is over 9,500 years old.Several Arctic dog breeds, including the Siberian, show a significant genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes – the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog, also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser extent, the Shar-Pei and Finnish Spitz. There is data to indicate admixture of between 1 and 3% between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. The Braque Saint-Germain (FCI No. 115) (translated into English as the St. Germain Pointing Dog) is a medium-large breed of dog, a versatile hunter used for hunting as a gun dog and pointer as well as for hunting other small game.  \"Braque\" is a term meaning pointing dogs.  The breed was created around 1830 by crossing English and French pointing type dogs. A pointing breed is a type of gundog typically used in finding game.  Gundogs are traditionally divided into three classes: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds.  The name \"pointer\" comes from the dog's instinct to \"point\", by stopping and aiming its muzzle towards game.  This demonstrates to the hunter the location of his or her quarry and allows them to move into gun range.  Pointers were selectively bred from dogs who had abundant pointing and backing instinct.  They typically start to acquire their hunting instincts at about 2 months of age. Leonhard \"Sepp\" Seppala (; September 14, 1877 – January 28, 1967) was a Norwegian-Kven-American sled dog breeder, trainer and musher who with his dogs played a pivotal role in the 1925 serum run to Nome, and participated in the 1932 Winter Olympics. Seppala introduced the work dogs used by Native Siberians at the time to the American public; the breed came to be known as the Siberian Husky in the English-speaking world. The Leonhard Seppala Humanitarian Award, which honors excellence in sled dog care, is named in honour of him.: 64  Background Seppala was born in Lyngen Municipality in Troms county, Northern Norway. He was the eldest child of Isak Isaksen Seppälä (Tornedalian born in Sweden) and Anne Henrikke Henriksdatter. His father's family name is of Finnish origin. Seppälä comes from the Finnish word seppä, meaning smith. Leonhard is considered to have been Kven. When Seppala was two years old, his family moved within Troms county to the nearby the island of Skjervøya in Skjervøy Municipality. While in Skjervøy, his father worked as a blacksmith and fisherman, building up a relatively large estate. Seppala initially followed in his father's footsteps as both a blacksmith and a fisherman. However, in 1900, he emigrated to Alaska during the Nome gold rush. His friend Jafet Lindeberg had returned from Alaska and convinced Seppala to come to work for his mining company in Nome. He became a naturalized citizen in 1906.During his first winter in Alaska, Seppala became a dogsled driver for Lindeberg's company. He enjoyed the task from his first run, which he recalled clearly for the rest of his life. He expressed pleasure in the rhythmic patter of the dogs' feet and the feeling of the sled gliding along the snow. While most drivers considered 30 miles (48 km) a long run, Seppala travelled between 50 miles (80 km) and 100 miles (160 km) most days. This also meant he worked as long as 12 hours a day. He kept his dogs in form during the summer by having them pull a cart on wheels instead of a sled. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon (also called the Korthals Griffon , and the Griffon d'arrêt à poil dur Korthals in France and Quebec) is a breed of dog used in hunting as a gundog.  It is sometimes considered to be Dutch in ancestry, due to the nationality of the breed founder, Eduard Karel Korthals.  History records the progression of the development of the breed through Biebeshein am Rhen Germany where the founder established the Ipenwoud kennel and the breed type was established and then into France where it is now recognized.  Others consider the Griffon to be a German breed because Korthals' kennel, Ipenwoud, was located in Biebesheim am Rhein, Germany.  It was there for over twenty years that Korthals dedicated his life to the development and perfection of the Korthals Griffon.

It was there for over twenty years that Korthals dedicated his life to the development  and perfection of the Korthals Griffon. The breed is still relatively rare in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom despite long recognition by their respective national kennel clubs, as well as the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale).  The Korthals Griffon is particularly adapted for hunting in thick undergrowth and around water, where its harsh coat is excellent protection.  The griffon is used primarily as a hunting dog for upland game birds as well as waterfowl.    Appearance  The Korthals Griffon is a strong medium-sized dog (20-22\" for females, 22-24\" for males) and 35-50 pounds for females and 50-70 pounds for males with a harsh, wiry outer coat and a softer under coat.  The coat is preferably steel gray with brown markings.  Other acceptable colors: chestnut brown, white and brown, roan, and white and orange. All brown, all white or white and orange are less desirable.  A black coat disqualifies.    The griffon has a large and long head, with large rounded eyes covered with eyebrows and complemented with a beard.  The nose is always brown.  The neck is long and body well proportioned and muscular.  Depending on the country, the tail may be docked.    History  Eduard Karel Korthals is credited with the breed around 1873.

Others consider the Griffon to be a German breed because Korthals' kennel, Ipenwoud, was located in Biebesheim am Rhein, Germany.  It was there for over twenty years that Korthals dedicated his life to the development  and perfection of the Korthals Griffon. The breed is still relatively rare in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom despite long recognition by their respective national kennel clubs, as well as the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale).  The Korthals Griffon is particularly adapted for hunting in thick undergrowth and around water, where its harsh coat is excellent protection.  The griffon is used primarily as a hunting dog for upland game birds as well as waterfowl. Togo (1913 – December 5, 1929) was the lead sled dog of musher Leonhard Seppala and his dog sled team in the 1925 serum run to Nome across central and northern Alaska. Despite covering a far greater distance than any other lead dogs on the run, over some of the most dangerous parts of the trail, his role was left out of contemporary news of the event at the time, in favor of the lead dog for the last leg of the relay, Balto, whom Seppala also owned and had bred.Deemed at first a mere troublemaker, before being identified as a natural leader and puppy prodigy by Seppala, Togo had already shown extreme feats of dedication and endurance as a puppy, and as an adult continued to show unusual feats of intelligence, saving the lives of his team and musher on more than one occasion. Sled dogs bred from his line have contributed to the 'Seppala Siberian' sleddog line, as well as the mainstream Siberian Husky gene pool. Background Togo was one of the offspring of former lead dog Suggen and the female Siberian import Dolly. Early pedigree records are inconsistent in his birth year, including those kept by his breeder Viktor Anderson and his owner, Seppala; most sources published list his birth year as 1913, but no other form of consensus exists on his exact time of birth. He was named Cugu [tso`go], which means puppy in Northern Sami language, and later after the Japanese Admiral, Tōgō Heihachirō. Initially, he did notlook like he had potential as a sled dog. He only grew to about 48 pounds (22 kg) in adulthood and had a black, brown, and gray coat that made him appear perpetually dirty.Togo was ill as a young puppy and required intensive nursing from Seppala's wife. He was very bold and rowdy, thus seen as \"difficult and mischievous\", showing \"all the signs of becoming a ... canine delinquent\" according to one reporter. At first, this behaviour was interpreted as evidence that he had been spoiled by the individual attention given to him during his illness. The Wirehaired Vizsla ( ; ] ; English plural: Vizslas or sometimes Vizslak, based on the Hungarian plural vizslák ] ), is a dog breed originating in Hungary.  Wirehaired Vizslas are known as excellent hunting dogs, and also have a level personality making them suited for families.  The Wirehaired Vizsla is a versatile, natural hunter endowed with an excellent nose and an above average trainability.  Although they are lively, gentle mannered, demonstrably affectionate and sensitive, they are also fearless and possessed of a well-developed protective instinct.  The breed has a firmness on point, is an excellent retriever, and has the determination to remain on the scent even when swimming.  The overall appearance embodies the qualities of a multi-purpose pointing dog, endurance, working ability and an easily satisfied nature.  This is a dog of power and drive in the field, yet is a tractable and affectionate companion in the home.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: What son of Zeus in Greek mythology was said to have fatheres an Argonaut seer?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nIn Greek mythology, Echo ( ; Greek: Ἠχώ , \"Ēkhō\", \"echo\", from ἦχος (\"ēchos\"), \"sound\") was an Oread who resided on Mount Cithaeron.  Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and often visited them on Earth.  Eventually, Zeus's wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came from Mt. Olympus in an attempt to catch Zeus with the nymphs.  Echo, by trying to protect Zeus, endured Hera's wrath, and Hera made her only able to speak the last few words spoken to her.  So when Echo met Narcissus and fell in love with him, she was unable to tell him how she felt and was forced to watch him as he fell in love with himself. In Greek mythology, Rhacius (Greek: Ῥάκιος ) was the son of Lebes, and the leader of the first Greeks to settle in Caria, and became King of Caria.  His court was located at Colophon in Ionia.  With his wife Manto, daughter of the seer Teiresias, he was the father of Mopsus, a renowned seer. The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which succeeded in preparing and landing the first men on the Moon from 1968 to 1972. It was first conceived in 1960 during President Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person Project Mercury, which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal for the 1960s of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to Congress on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.Kennedy's goal was accomplished on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last, Apollo 17, in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve people walked on the Moon.Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when an Apollo 1 cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first successful landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the Apollo 13 landing had to be aborted after an oxygen tank exploded en route to the Moon, crippling the CSM. The crew barely managed a safe return to Earth by using the lunar module as a \"lifeboat\" on the return journey. In Greek mythology, Carnus (also spelled Carneus and Carneius) was a seer from Acarnania.  According to the poet Praxilla, he was a son of Zeus and Europa.  He was reared by Leto and Apollo, and is also known to have been a lover of Apollo. In Greek mythology, Idmon was an Argonaut seer.  Allegedly a son of Apollo, he had Abas (or Ampycus) as his mortal father.  His mother was Asteria, daughter of Coronus, or Cyrene, or else Antianeira, daughter of Pheres.  By Laothoe he had a son Thestor.  Idmon foresaw his own death in the Argonaut expedition, but joined anyway.

He came from Epidaurus and was portrayed in the poem cleansing Tydeus' wounds after a battle.\n\n\n== Notes == In Greek mythology, Porthaon (Greek: Πορθάων, genitive Πορθάονος ), sometimes referred to as Parthaon or Portheus (seems related to the verb \"portheō\" and \"perthō\", \"destroy'), was the king of Calydon, husband of Euryte and father of Oeneus, Agrius, Alcathous, Melas, Leucopeus and Sterope, also of the Argonaut Laocoön by an unnamed female servant, or by Euryte too.  He was the son of Agenor (by Epicaste) who was the son of Pleuron who was the son of Aetolus who was the son of Endymion.  He was the brother of Demonice (also known as Demodice). In Greek mythology, Phthonus (Greek: Φθόνος , \"Phthónos\") was the personification of jealousy and envy, especially in matters of love.  He was said to be the counterpart of Nemesis.  The god had a great many wives but killed each one eventually, on suspicions of adultery.  However, his power influenced not only him and mortals, but also the gods as well (most famously Hera).  According to some scholars, he was the son of Nyx and/or Dionysus.  But based on other documents, he was implied to be the son of Aphrodite.  In these, it was he that directed Hera's attention to Zeus's many affairs, including one of his most famous, that with the Theban princess Semele.  He also put the thought into Hera's mind to trick Semele into convincing Zeus into showing Semele his full glory, which killed her. In Greek mythology, Lycaon (/laɪˈkeɪɒn/; Greek: Λυκάων) was a king of Arcadia, son of Pelasgus and Meliboea, who, in the most popular version of the myth, tested Zeus by serving him the roasted flesh of Lycaon's own son Nyctimus, in order to see whether Zeus was truly omniscient.  In return for these gruesome deeds, Zeus transformed Lycaon and his offspring into the forms of a wolf; Nyctimus was restored to life. In Greek mythology, Anaxagoras (Greek: Αναξαγόρας ) was a king of Argos and son of either Megapenthes or his son Argeus.  The prince, Anaxagoras' son, suffered from a strange malady and the king offered a reward for anybody that could heal him.  Melampus, a local seer, killed an ox and talked to the vultures that came to eat the corpse.  They said that the last time they had had such a feast was when the king made a sacrifice.  They told Melampus that the prince had been frightened of the big, bloody knife and the king tossed it aside to calm the child.  It had hit a tree and injured a hamadryad, who cursed the prince with the sickness.  The hamadryad told Melampus that the boy would be healed if the knife was taken out of the trunk of the tree and boiled, then the rusty water that resulted drunk by the prince.  Melampus followed her directions and demanded two thirds of the kingdom for himself, and one third for his brother, Bias.  The king ultimately agreed.  When the women of Argos were driven mad by Dionysus, in the reign of Anaxagoras, Melampus was brought in to cure them, but demanded a third of the kingdom as payment.  The king refused, but the women became wilder than ever, and he was forced to seek out Melampus again, who this time demanded both a third for himself and another third for his brother Bias.  Sometimes, this story is told not of Anaxagoras, but of his grandfather, Proetus.  Anaxagoras was succeeded by his son Alector.  His house lasted longer than those of Bias and Melampus, and eventually the kingdom was reunited under its last member, Cyanippus. Leda and the Swan is a story and subject in art from Greek mythology in which the god Zeus, in the form of a swan, seduces Leda.  According to later Greek mythology, Leda bore Helen and Polydeuces, children of Zeus, while at the same time bearing Castor and Clytemnestra, children of her husband Tyndareus, the King of Sparta.  In the W. B. Yeats version, it is subtly suggested that Clytemnestra, although being the daughter of Tyndareus, has somehow been traumatized by what the swan has done to her mother (see below).  According to many versions of the story, Zeus took the form of a swan and seduced Leda on the same night she slept with her husband King Tyndareus.  In some versions, she laid two eggs from which the children hatched.  In other versions, Helen is a daughter of Nemesis, the goddess who personified the disaster that awaited those suffering from the pride of Hubris.  Apollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: Ἀπόλλων , \"Apollōn\" ( Ἀπόλλωνος ); Doric: Ἀπέλλων , \"Apellōn\"; Arcadocypriot: Ἀπείλων , \"Apeilōn\"; Aeolic: Ἄπλουν , \"Aploun\"; Latin: \"Apollō\" ) is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology.  The ideal of the \"kouros\" (a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music, truth and prophecy, healing, the sun and light, plague, poetry, and more.  Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto, and has a twin sister, the chaste huntress Artemis.  Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as \"Apulu\". Apollo is one of the  Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology. Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the Sun and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. He is considered to be the most beautiful god and is represented as the ideal of the kouros (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth). Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu. As the patron deity of Delphi (Apollo Pythios), Apollo is an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle and also the deity of ritual purification. His oracles were often consulted for guidance in various matters. He was in general seen as the god who affords help and wards off evil, and is referred to as Alexicacus, the \"averter of evil\". Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill health and deadly plague with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows. As the god of mousike, Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance, and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common attribute of Apollo. Protection of the young is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As a kourotrophos, Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children, and he presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age (ephebeia) and dedicated to Apollo. The god himself is depicted with long, uncut hair to symbolise his eternal youth. Apollo is an important pastoral deity, and he was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary rustic duties.

Arachne (; from Ancient Greek: Ἀράχνη, romanized: arákhnē, lit. 'spider', cognate with Latin araneus) is the protagonist of a tale in Greek mythology known primarily from the version told by the Roman poet Ovid (43  BCE–17 CE), which is the earliest extant source for the story. In Book Six of his epic poem Metamorphoses, Ovid recounts how the talented mortal Arachne challenged the goddess Athena to a weaving contest. When Athena could find no flaws in the tapestry Arachne had woven for the contest, the goddess became enraged and beat the girl with her shuttle. After Arachne hanged herself out of shame, she was transformed into a spider. The myth both provided an  etiology of spiders' web-spinning abilities and was a cautionary tale about hubris. Biography According to the myth as recounted by Ovid, Arachne was a Lydian maiden who was the daughter of Idmon of Colophon, who was a famous dyer in purple. She was credited to have invented linen cloth and nets while her son Closter introduced the use of spindle in the manufacture of wool. She was said to have been a native of Hypaepa, near Colophon in Asia Minor. Mythology  Ovid In Metamorphoses the Roman poet Ovid writes that Arachne was a shepherd's daughter who began weaving at an early age. She became a great weaver, boasted that her skill was greater than Athena's, and refused to acknowledge that her skill came, at least in part, from the goddess. Athena took offense and set up a contest between them. Presenting herself as an old lady, she approached the boasting girl and warned her that it was unwise to compare herself to any of the gods and that she should plead for forgiveness from Athena.Arachne was not disheartened and boasted that if Athena wished to make her stop, she should appear in person and do it herself. Immediately, Athena removed her disguise and appeared in shimmering glory, clad in a sparkling white chiton. The two began weaving straight away. Athena's weaving represented four separate contests between mortals and the gods in which the gods punished mortals for setting themselves as equals of the gods.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

He is the current senior United States Senator from Mississippi (the third most-senior Senator and the second most-senior Republican member), first elected to the Senate in 1978, and the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which he had also chaired from 2005 to 2007.  He also chaired the Senate Agriculture Committee from 2003 to 2005.  Cochran won reelection to a seventh term in 2014, after defeating Chris McDaniel in an intense primary run-off election.  He is currently the dean of the Mississippi congressional delegation.  He is also on track to become the longest serving Republican Member of Congress if he serves until 2019, surpassing Joseph Gurney Cannon, former Speaker of the House, who served for 46 years. William Thad Cochran ( KOK-rən; December 7, 1937 – May 30, 2019) was an American attorney and politician who served as a United States senator for Mississippi from 1978 to 2018. A Republican, he previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1973 to 1978. Born in Pontotoc, Mississippi, Cochran graduated from the University of Mississippi.  He served in the United States Navy as an ensign (1959–1961) before graduating from the University of Mississippi School of Law.  After practicing law for several years in Jackson, Mississippi, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1972. He served three terms in the House representing Jackson and portions of southwest Mississippi. Cochran won a three-way race for U.S. Senate in 1978, becoming the first Republican to win a United States Senate election in Mississippi since Blanche Bruce was elected during Reconstruction.  He was re-elected to six terms by wide margins. He was chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee from 2005 to 2007 and again from 2015 to 2018.  He also chaired the Senate Agriculture Committee from 2003 to 2005.  With over 45 years of combined House and Senate service, Cochran is the second longest-serving member of Congress ever from Mississippi, only after former Democratic U.S. Representative Jamie L. Whitten. Cochran resigned from the Senate due to health issues in April 2018. Cochran died on May 30, 2019 in Oxford, Mississippi.    Early life  William Thad Cochran was born on December 7, 1937, in Pontotoc, Mississippi, the son of Emma Grace (née Berry) and William Holmes Cochran, a teacher and school principal, respectively. His family settled in Hinds County, Mississippi, home of the state capital, Jackson, in 1946 after a few moves around the northern part of the state. He graduated valedictorian from Byram High School near Jackson. Cochran then received a B.A. degree from the University of Mississippi with a major in psychology and a minor in political science in 1959. There he joined the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity and was on the cheerleading squad (fellow senator Trent Lott was also an Ole Miss cheerleader).

The 2018 United States Senate special election in Mississippi took place on November 6, 2018, in order to elect a member of the United States Senate to represent the state of Mississippi. On April 1, 2018, a U.S. Senate vacancy was created when Republican senator Thad Cochran resigned due to health concerns. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant appointed Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith to fill the vacancy. Hyde-Smith sought election to serve the balance of Cochran's term, which was scheduled to expire in January 2021. On November 6, 2018, per Mississippi law, a nonpartisan top-two special general election took place on the same day as the regularly scheduled U.S. Senate election for the seat then held by Roger Wicker. Party affiliations were not printed on the ballot. Because no candidate gained a simple majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two candidates, Hyde-Smith and Mike Espy, was held on November 27, 2018. Hyde-Smith defeated Espy, 53.63%-46.37%. The victory made Hyde-Smith the first woman ever elected to Congress from Mississippi.

Incumbent Republican Senator Thad Cochran, first elected in 1978, ran for re-election to a seventh term. Primary elections were held on June 3, 2014. The election was notable for the contentious Republican primary between Cochran and a Tea Party-backed challenger, Chris McDaniel. After neither Cochran nor McDaniel received 50% of the vote in the primary, a runoff election was held on June 24, 2014. After narrowly defeating McDaniel in the runoff, Cochran defeated Democratic nominee Travis Childers, a former congressman, with nearly 60% of the vote. Background Thad Cochran was first elected to the Senate with a plurality of the vote in a three-way race in 1978. He was reelected with at least 61% of the vote in 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008.Cochran was the last incumbent senator up for reelection in 2014 to declare whether he would run, causing widespread speculation that he would retire. Despite being urged to declare his intentions, Cochran said in August 2013, \"I don't have a fixed date. But [I will decide] by the end of the year. You don't want to rush into these things.\" On November 12, he announced that he would reveal his plans by the end of the month. On December 6, he confirmed that he would run.Cochran's fundraising ability, powerful Senate committee assignments, and very high approval ratings meant that he was considered \"unbeatable\". Mississippi Democratic Party Chairman Rickey Cole said that \"in the very likely event that he does [run], we don't foresee a major Democratic challenger emerging.\" Had he chosen to retire, a \"stampede\" was predicted in the Republican primary and Democrats believed that a \"properly positioned\" candidate could have been competitive in the general election. Republican primary The United States Senate Republican primary election in Mississippi took place on June 3, 2014. Incumbent Republican Senator Thad Cochran, who had served in the position since 1978, ran for reelection to a seventh term. He was challenged for the nomination by State Senator Chris McDaniel, a Tea Party supporter, and Thomas Carey. Taylor Francis Barras (born January 1957) is an accountant and banker from New Iberia, Louisiana, who is a Republican member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 48, based in Iberia Parish.  On January 11, 2016, as he began his third term in the chamber, Barras was elected House Speaker by his colleagues, who in what was considered a political upset on the second ballot rejected Representative Walt Leger, III, of New Orleans, the choice of incoming Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards.  Barras received fifty-six votes; Leger, forty-nine.  Since the days of Huey Pierce Long, Jr., legislators had confirmed the governor's choice for Speaker, but the Republican House majority instead elected Barras, the governor's wishes to the contrary. Christopher Brian \"Chris\" McDaniel (born June 28, 1972) is an American attorney, conservative commentator, and is a Republican politician in the Mississippi Senate representing the 42nd District, which encompasses part of South Mississippi. Christopher Brian McDaniel (born June 28, 1971) is an American attorney, talk radio host, perennial candidate for statewide office, and politician who served in the Mississippi State Senate from 2008 to 2024. His politics have been widely described as far-right. He has been described as the leader of that faction of the Mississippi Republican Party, believing \"the government is the big, bad enemy of working people, and it should be completely stripped of its size and might so that citizens may take full control of their lives.\" A member of the Republican Party, McDaniel gained national attention for his Tea Party-backed 2014 Republican primary challenge to incumbent U.S. Senator Thad Cochran. After neither candidate received a majority in a hard-fought primary, Cochran narrowly defeated McDaniel in the runoff election. McDaniel ran for the U.S. Senate again in 2018, winning 16.4% of the vote in the nonpartisan, four-candidate primary. McDaniel then ran for Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent Delbert Hosemann.    Early life and education  McDaniel was born in Laurel, Mississippi. He is the only child of Carlos and Charlotte McDaniel. He graduated with honors from Jones County Junior College and the grandson of Luke McDaniel, a country and rockabilly singer. and received a B.S. with honors from William Carey University in 1994.

Laramie () is a city in and the county seat of Albany County, Wyoming, United States, known for its high elevation at 7,200 feet (2,200 m), railroad history, and as the higher-education center for the state of Wyoming. The population was 31,407 at the 2020 census, making it the 4th most populous city in Wyoming. Located on the Laramie River in southeastern Wyoming, the city is west of Cheyenne and 25 miles (40 km) north of the Colorado state line, at the junction of Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 287.After 12,000 years or more of Indigenous populations living in the area, Laramie was settled by European Americans in 1868 with the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad line to the area, which crosses the Laramie River at Laramie. The river and several creeks fed by freshwater springs made the area an attractive place for settlement. It is home to the University of Wyoming, WyoTech, and a branch of Laramie County Community College. Laramie Regional Airport serves Laramie. The ruins of Fort Sanders, an army fort predating Laramie, lie just south of the city along Route 287. Located in the Laramie Valley between the Snowy Range and the Laramie Range, the city draws outdoor enthusiasts with its abundance of outdoor activities. Etymology Laramie is named for Jacques LaRamie, a French or French-Canadian trapper who disappeared in the Laramie Mountains in the early 1820s. He was one of the first Europeans to visit the area. European-American settlers named a river, mountain range, peak, US Army fort, county, and city for him. More Wyoming landmarks are named for him than for any other trapper but Jim Bridger. Because the name was used so frequently, the town was called Laramie City for decades to distinguish it from other uses. Founding The city was founded in the mid-1860s as a tent city near the Overland Stage Line route, the Union Pacific portion of the first transcontinental railroad, and just north of Fort Sanders army post. The rails reached Laramie on May 4, 1868, when construction crews worked through town. A few passengers arrived on that same day. Riverton is a city in Fremont County, Wyoming, United States.  The city's population was 10,682 at the 2020 census, making it the most populous city in the county. History The city, founded in 1906, is an incorporated entity of the state of Wyoming. The community was named Riverton because of the four rivers that meet there. The town was built on land ceded from the Wind River Indian Reservation, a situation that often makes it subject to jurisdictional claims by the nearby Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes.A legal ruling on November 7, 2017, by the 10th Circuit Court, ruled again in the EPA reservation boundary dispute. Though the decision was complex, the 10th Circuit Court answered plainly. Riverton is not on the reservation. The 10th Circuit's decision is now official and final after the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals 2017 ruling. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the EPA, and held that the land had been ceded in 1905 by an Act of Congress. This ruling ends the dispute, bringing the debate and controversy to an end.Riverton Regional Airport (now Central Wyoming Regional Airport) is home to a National Weather Service Forecast Office and NEXRAD radar site which is responsible to cover all of western and central Wyoming.The Chicago & Northwestern Railway completed an extension of the \"Cowboy Line\" through to Lander which is roughly 22 miles west of Riverton.  Plans were to continue the line west from Lander.  In 1972, the end of the line was moved from Lander and the new terminus of the line was in Riverton.  Services were then discontinued in Riverton in the mid-1970's as the line was slowly dismantled west of Casper. Demographics  2010 census As of the census of 2010, there were 10,615 people, 4,252 households, and 2,600 families living in the city. The population density was 1,076.6 inhabitants per square mile (415.7/km2). There were 4,567 housing units at an average density of 463.2 per square mile (178.8/km2).\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

A dark and dystopian deconstruction of the superhero genre, the film is set in an alternate history in the year 1985 at the height of the Cold War, as a group of mostly retired American superheroes investigate the murder of one of their own before uncovering an elaborate and deadly conspiracy with which they are all connected.For nearly two decades from October 1987 until October 2005, a live-action film adaptation of the Watchmen series became stranded in development hell. Producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver began developing the project at 20th Century Fox, later moving it to Warner Bros. Pictures, the sister company of Watchmen publisher DC Comics, and hiring director Terry Gilliam, who eventually left the production and deemed the complex comic \"unfilmable\". During the 2000s, Gordon and Lloyd Levin collaborated with Universal Pictures, Revolution Studios and Paramount Pictures to produce the film. Directors David Hayter, Darren Aronofsky, and Paul Greengrass were attached to the project before it was canceled over budget disputes. In October 2005, the project returned to Warner Bros., where Snyder was hired to direct. Paramount remained as its international distributor, whereas Warner Bros. would distribute the film in the United States. However, Fox sued Warner Bros. for copyright violation arising from Gordon's failure to pay a buy-out in 1991, which enabled him to develop the film at the other studios. Fox and Warner Bros. settled this before the film's release, with Fox receiving a portion of the gross. Principal photography began in Vancouver, in September 2007. As with his previous film 300 (2006), Snyder closely modeled his storyboards on the comic but chose not to shoot all of Watchmen using green screens and opted for real sets instead.Following its world premiere at Odeon Leicester Square on February 23, 2009, the film was released in both conventional and IMAX theatres on March 6, 2009. Nixon v. General Services Administration, 433 U.S 425 (1977), is a landmark court case concerning the principle of presidential privilege and whether the public is allowed to view a President’s “confidential documents”.  The Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, signed into law by President Gerald Ford in 1974, ordered that the Administrator of General Services obtain President Richard Nixon’s presidential papers and tape recordings.  In addition, the Act further ordered that government archivists seize these materials.  These archivists would preserve the material deemed historic and return to former President Nixon the materials deemed as private.  Furthermore, this Act stated that material that was preserved could be used in judicial hearings and proceedings.  Immediately after this Act was enacted, Richard Nixon filed a lawsuit in a federal district court claiming that the Act violated the principle of separation of powers, the principle of presidential privilege, Nixon’s personal privacy, his First Amendment right of association, and further asserted that it amounted to a constitutionally prohibited Bill of Attainder. Glory Enough for All is a 1988 television movie directed by Eric Till and written by Grahame Woods depicting the discovery and isolation of insulin by Frederick Banting and Charles Herbert Best.

It is based on the books \"The Discovery of Insulin\" and \"Banting: A Biography\" by historian Michael Bliss. Watchmen is an American comic-book limited series published by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987, and collected in 1987.  The series was created by a British collaboration consisting of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colorist John Higgins.  \"Watchmen\" originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics.

Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead. Moore used the story as a means of reflecting contemporary anxieties, of deconstructing and satirizing the superhero concept and of making political commentary. Watchmen depicts an alternate history in which superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal was never exposed. In 1985 the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government.

Gibbons uses a nine-panel grid layout throughout the series and adds recurring symbols such as a blood-stained smiley face.

Structured at times as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through space, time and plot. In the same manner, entire scenes and dialogues have parallels with others through synchronicity, coincidence, and repeated imagery. A commercial success, Watchmen has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press. Watchmen was recognized in Time's List of the 100 Best Novels as one of the best English language novels published since 1923. In a retrospective review, the BBC's Nicholas Barber described it as \"the moment comic books grew up\". Moore opposed this idea, stating, \"I tend to think that, no, comics hadn't grown up. There were a few titles that were more adult than people were used to. But the majority of comics titles were pretty much the same as they'd ever been. It wasn't comics growing up.

Watchmen is a 2019 American superhero drama limited series based on the 1986 DC Comics series of the same title created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. The TV series was created for HBO by Damon Lindelof, who also served as an executive producer and writer. Its ensemble cast includes Regina King, Don Johnson, Tim Blake Nelson, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Andrew Howard, Jacob Ming-Trent, Tom Mison, Sara Vickers, Dylan Schombing, Louis Gossett Jr. and Jeremy Irons. Jean Smart and Hong Chau joined the cast in later episodes.Lindelof likened the television series to a \"remix\" of the original comic series. While the series is technically a sequel that takes place 34 years after the events of the comics within the same alternate reality, Lindelof wanted to introduce new characters and conflicts which created a new story within the Watchmen continuity, rather than creating a reboot. The series focuses on events surrounding racist violence in present-day Tulsa, Oklahoma. A white supremacist group called the Seventh Kavalry has taken up arms against the Tulsa Police Department because of perceived racial injustices, causing the police to conceal their identities with masks to prevent the Seventh Kavalry from targeting them in their homes following the \"White Night\". Angela Abar (portrayed by King), a detective known as Sister Night, investigates the murder of her friend and the chief of the police, Judd Crawford (Johnson), and discovers secrets regarding the situations around vigilantism.The series, promoted by HBO as an ongoing drama series, premiered on October 20, 2019, before concluding its nine-episode run on December 15. Lindelof left his role as showrunner after the first season, stating that he had completed his intended story. HBO subsequently confirmed there are no further plans for the show to continue without Lindelof returning in some capacity, and reclassified the work as a limited series with possible future installments.Watchmen received widespread critical acclaim for its performances, writing, visuals, score, and expansion of the source material, as well as commendation for highlighting the 1921 Tulsa race massacre. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, or simply Wisden, colloquially the Bible of Cricket, is a cricket reference book published annually in the United Kingdom. The description \"Bible of cricket\" (or variations thereof) has been applied to Wisden since the early 1900s. Between 1998 and 2005, an Australian edition of Wisden was published. An Indian version, edited by Suresh Menon, was produced annually from 2013 to 2018, but discontinued following the publication of a combined 2019 and 2020 issue. History During the Victorian era there was a growing public appetite for sporting trivia, especially of a statistical nature. Wisden was founded in 1864 by the English cricketer John Wisden (1826–84) as a competitor to Fred Lillywhite's The Guide to Cricketers. Its annual publication has continued uninterrupted to the present day, making it the longest running sports annual in history. In 1869, the sixth edition became the first published under its current title, prior to which it had been The Cricketer's Almanack (with the apostrophe before the \"s\"). The first edition may have been based on a diary written by Francis Emilius Cary Elwes in 1863 and discovered in 2016, although to what extent this was the case remains open to question.Charles Pardon, with George Kelly King, founded the Cricket Reporting Agency (CRA) in 1880. From Pardon's becoming editor of Wisden in 1887, the editor was nearly always a CRA partner and the CRA was responsible for the editorial production of the Almanack, until in 1965 it merged with the Press Association (PA).Wisden was acquired and published by Robert Maxwell's publishing conglomerate, Macdonald, in the 1970s. Cricket fan Sir John Paul Getty, Jr., bought the company, John Wisden & Co., in 1993 and in December 2008 it was sold to A&C Black, which is owned by Bloomsbury. The company presented the Wisden Trophy, for Test matches between England and West Indies, in 1963 to celebrate its 100th edition.The Little Wonder: The Remarkable History of Wisden by Robert Winder was published in 2013 (\"The Little Wonder\" was John Wisden's nickname). A memorandum known as the Zilch memo was an American government document sent by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to President Richard Nixon on January 3, 1972, about the military situation in Laos during the Vietnam War.  On the memo, in his own handwriting, Nixon described the decade-long bombing campaign by the United States in Southeast Asia as a \"failure,\" having achieved \"zilch,\" despite public comments to the contrary.  Just the day before, January 2, Nixon told CBS News reporter Dan Rather in an interview that the bombing was \"very, very effective.\"  Previously missing from the Richard Nixon Library, the memo was discovered in the possession of Alexander Butterfield, who served as the Deputy Assistant to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973, by \"Washington Post\" reporter Bob Woodward, who subsequently published it in his 2015 book \"The Last of the President's Men\".\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

It opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on October 31, 1946 and closed on March 13, 1948, after 564 performances.  It starred Helen Hayes, for whom it was written.  The story involves Addie, a mousy librarian who becomes enamoured of a handsome bank clerk, and her attempts to win him over.  It was directed by Joshua Logan and featured a song written for the show, \"I Haven't Got a Worry in the World\", with music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and James Livingston. Bridget Rose Jones is a fictional character created by British writer Helen Fielding. Jones first appeared in Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary column in The Independent in 1995, which did not carry any byline. Thus, it seemed to be an actual personal diary chronicling the life of Jones as a thirtysomething single woman in London as she tries to make sense of life, love, and relationships with the help of a surrogate \"urban family\" of friends in the 1990s. The column was, in fact, a lampoon of women's obsession with love, marriage and romance as well as women's magazines such as Cosmopolitan and wider social trends in Britain at the time. Fielding published the novelisation of the column in 1996, followed by a sequel in 1999 called The Edge of Reason.Both novels were adapted for film in 2001 and 2004, starring Renée Zellweger as Bridget Jones, and Hugh Grant and Colin Firth as the men in her life: Daniel Cleaver and Mark Darcy, respectively. After Fielding had ceased to work for The Daily Telegraph in late 1998, the feature began again in The Independent on 4 August 2005 and finished in June 2006. Helen Fielding released a third novel in 2013 (Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, which is set 14 years after the events of the second novel) and a fourth in 2016 (Bridget Jones's Baby: The Diaries, where Bridget finds herself unexpectedly pregnant without being certain who the father is).\"Bridget Jones\" is hailed as a  British cultural icon and was named on the 2016 Woman's Hour Power List as one of seven women judged to have had the biggest impact on women's lives over the past 70 years. Plot summary  Original column and novelizations The plot of the first novel is loosely based on Pride and Prejudice.Bridget Jones is a Bangor University graduate. She is a 34-year-old (32 in the first film adaptation) single woman whose life is a satirized version of the stereotypical single London 30-something in the 1990s and very unlucky in love. John Emerson (born Clifton Paden; May 29, 1874 – March 7, 1956) was an American stage actor, playwright, producer, and director of silent films (many featuring Douglas Fairbanks). Emerson was married to Anita Loos from June 15, 1919, until his death, and prior to that the couple had worked together as a writing team for motion pictures. They would continue to be credited jointly, even as Loos pursued independent projects. Biography Born and educated in Ohio, Emerson's earliest documented acting credits date from 1904, however like D. W. Griffith he probably played in regional stock companies before then. By 1912—the earliest known year for his involvement in film, as a writer—Emerson was working regularly as a director and writer on the Broadway stage. After periods with American Film Manufacturing Company, where he worked with Allan Dwan and Famous Players–Lasky, Emerson collaborated with George Nichols in making Ghosts, a Griffith production made for Reliance-Majestic Studios during the waning days of work on The Birth of a Nation. The result impressed Griffith to such an extent that Emerson stayed on as Reliance-Majestic changed its name to Fine Arts Film Company and came under the Triangle Film Corporation banner.John Emerson became one Triangle's best-known directors, primarily after the partnership with writer Anita Loos began in 1916; Griffith also valued the pair as being among the best film editors in the business, and they also worked on editing Griffith's massive Intolerance in addition to light, breezy and athletic comedies starring Douglas Fairbanks. Emerson seemed to lose interest in direction around 1919, and afterward worked as a producer and writer, though commonly in projects more readily associated with Loos' taste than his own. Loos wrote extensively, and often disparagingly, of Emerson in her memoirs, but in her early career insisted on maintaining the appearance of partnership with Emerson even if there was none. Emerson's later years were marked by mental illness and long institutionalizations; Loos never divorced him.Although Anita Loos' memoirs may not paint Emerson in the most flattering of terms, the silent films he directed from 1915 to 1919 were important ones. Most of them survive, including notably The Mystery of the Leaping Fish and The Americano.Emerson was president of the Actors' Equity Association during its strike against the Producing Managers Association in 1919.

It occupied the number one spot on the Sunday Times bestseller list for six months. In her review for the New York Times, Sarah Lyall called the novel “sharp and humorous” and said that Fielding had “allowed her heroine to grow up into someone funnier and more interesting than she was before.” The movie Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, announced for release in 2025, will see Renee Zellweger reprising her role as Bridget Jones for the fourth time.

Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a musical with a book by Joseph Fields and Anita Loos, lyrics by Leo Robin, and music by Jule Styne, based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Loos.  The story involves an American woman's voyage to Paris to perform in a nightclub. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Intimate Diary of a Professional Lady is a comic novel written by Anita Loos, first published in 1925.  It is one of several famous novels published that year to chronicle the so-called Jazz Age, including Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" and Van Vechten's \"Firecrackers\".  Loos was inspired to write the book after watching a sexy blonde turn intellectual H. L. Mencken into a lovestruck schoolboy.  Mencken, a close friend, actually enjoyed the work and saw to it that it was published.  Originally published as a magazine series in \"Harper's Bazaar\", it was published as a book by Boni & Liveright in 1925 and became a runaway best seller, becoming the second best selling title of 1926 and earning the praise of no less than Edith Wharton who dubbed it \"The Great American Novel.\" Hold Your Man is a 1933 American pre-Code romantic drama film directed by an uncredited Sam Wood and starring Jean Harlow and Clark Gable, the third of their six films together.  The screenplay by Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers was based on a story by Loos. Anita Loos (April 26, 1889 – August 18, 1981) was an American screenwriter, playwright and author, best known for her blockbuster comic novel, \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\".  She wrote film scripts from 1912, and became arguably the first-ever staff scriptwriter, when D.W. Griffith put her on the payroll at Triangle Film Corporation.  She went on to write many of the Douglas Fairbanks films, as well as the stage adaptation of Colette’s \"Gigi\". Corinne Anita Loos  (April 26, 1888 – August 18, 1981) was an American actress, novelist, playwright and screenwriter. In 1912, she became the first female staff screenwriter in Hollywood, when D. W. Griffith put her on the payroll at Triangle Film Corporation. She is best known for her 1925 comic novel, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, and her 1951 Broadway adaptation of Colette's novella Gigi.    Early life  Loos was born in Sisson (now Mount Shasta), California, to Richard Beers Loos and Minerva Ellen \"Minnie\" (Smith) Loos. She had one sister, Gladys Loos, and one brother, Dr. Harry Clifford Loos, a physician and a co-founder of the Ross-Loos Medical Group. About pronouncing her name, Loos said, \"The family has always used the correct French pronunciation which is lohse. However, I myself pronounce my name as if it were spelled luce, since most people pronounce it that way and it was too much trouble to correct them.\" Her father founded Sisson Mascot, a tabloid newspaper, for which her mother did most of the work of a publisher. In 1892, when Anita was three years old, the family moved to San Francisco, where her father bought the newspaper Music and Drama, with money that her mother \"wheedled\" from her maternal grandfather, dropped the subject of music, in which he had no interest, and retitled the weekly to The Dramatic Review, filled with the photographs of pretty girls, that copied the format of  the British Police Gazette, and lead to her father's romance with the opera singer Alice Nielsen. By age six, Anita Loos wanted to be a writer. While living in San Francisco, she accompanied her father, an alcoholic, on exciting fishing trips to the pier, exploring the city's underbelly (the Tenderloin and the Barbary Coast) and making friends with the locals. This fed her lifelong fascination with lowlifes and loose women.    Early career  In 1897, at their father's urging, Loos and her sister performed in a San Francisco stock company production of Quo Vadis? Gladys died at age eight of appendicitis, while their father was away on business. Anita continued appearing on stage, being the family's breadwinner.

Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Intimate Diary of a Professional Lady (1925) is a comic novel written by American author Anita Loos. The story follows the dalliances of a young blonde gold-digger and flapper named Lorelei Lee \"in the bathtub-gin era of American history.\" Published the same year as F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Carl Van Vechten's Firecrackers, the lighthearted work is one of several famous 1925 American novels which focus upon the carefree hedonism of the Jazz Age.Originally serialized as a series of sketches in Harper's Bazaar during the spring and summer of 1925, Loos' sketches were republished in book form by Boni & Liveright in November 1925. Although dismissed by critics as \"too light in texture to be very enduring,\" the book garnered the praise of many writers including F. Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, William Faulkner, and H. G. Wells. Edith Wharton hailed Loos' satirical work as \"the great American novel\" as the character of Lorelei Lee embodied the avarice and self-indulgence that characterized 1920s America during the presidencies of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge.Loos' book became the second-best selling title of 1926 in the United States and a runaway international bestseller. It was printed throughout the world in over 13 different languages, including Russian and Chinese. By the time Loos died of a heart attack in 1981 at the age of 93, the work had been printed in over 85 editions and adapted into a 1926 comic strip, a 1928 silent comedy, a 1949 Broadway musical, and a 1953 film adaptation of the musical. Loos wrote a sequel, But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes, in 1927. Decades later, Loos was asked during a television interview whether she intended to write a third book. She facetiously replied that the title and theme of a third book would be Gentlemen Prefer Gentlemen. This quip resulted in the interview's abrupt termination. Background While working as a screenwriter in Hollywood, the forty-year-old Anita Loos was inspired to write Gentlemen Prefer Blondes by an incident aboard a train in early 1925.

The movie was made with the co-operation of Yoko Ono, who controlled the song rights. Onobox is a 1992 comprehensive 6-disc collection of Yoko Ono's work from 1968 to 1985.  The discs are grouped by era and theme.  Disc three features the entire \"Feeling the Space\" project, which was originally conceived and recorded as a double album before being edited down, while disc six is the previously unreleased 1974 album \"A Story\", which was later reissued separately with an altered track listing, along with the rest of Ono's back catalogue.  There was also an accompanying concise one-disc \"greatest hits\" release, entitled \"Walking on Thin Ice\".  While the Rykodisc press release for Onobox declared the collection \"not as bad as you might think\", it also urged the public to \"smash your preconceptions\".  Which, for the most part, they did, finding the box gave \"Yoko Ono the avant- garde heroine her due\".

Julian Charles John Lennon (born John Charles Julian Lennon; 8 April 1963) is an English musician, photographer, author, and philanthropist. He is the son of Beatles member John Lennon and his first wife, Cynthia, and he is named after his paternal grandmother, Julia Lennon. Julian inspired three Beatles songs: \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" (1967), \"Hey Jude\" (1968), and \"Good Night\" (1968). His parents divorced in 1968 after his father had an affair with Yoko Ono. Lennon started a music career in 1984 with the album Valotte, best known for its lead single \"Too Late for Goodbyes\", and has since released six more albums. He has held exhibitions of his fine-art photography and has written several children's books. In 2006, Lennon produced the environmental documentary film Whaledreamers, which won eight international awards. In 2007, he founded The White Feather Foundation (TWFF), whose stated mission goal is to address \"environmental and humanitarian issues\".In 2020, Lennon was executive producer of the Netflix documentary Kiss the Ground about regenerative agriculture and the follow-up film Common Ground. In 2022, Lennon was executive producer of the documentary film Women of the White Buffalo, which chronicles the lives of women living on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Early life Julian Lennon was born John Charles Julian Lennon on 8 April 1963 at Sefton General Hospital in Liverpool, to John Lennon and Cynthia Powell. He was named after his paternal grandmother, Julia Lennon, who died five years before his birth. The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, was his godfather. Lennon was educated firstly at Kingsmead School, Hoylake during 1974–1975; then, when his mother remarried, he moved to Wales and attended at Ruthin School, a boarding private school in the town of Ruthin, Denbighshire in North Wales.Lennon inspired one of his father's most famous songs, \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", whose lyrics describe a picture the boy had drawn, a watercolour painting of his friend, Lucy O'Donnell, from nursery school, surrounded by stars. Another composition of his father inspired by him was the lullaby \"Good Night\", the closing song of The Beatles (also known as The White Album). Sweet Toronto (sometimes referred as Sweet Toronto Peace Festival) is a documentary by D.A. Pennebaker of the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival, a one-day festival held September 13, 1969 at Varsity Stadium on the campus of the University of Toronto and attended by some 20,000 persons.  The event was produced by John Brower and Ken Walker.  John Lennon played as part of the Plastic Ono Band, whose members also included Yoko Ono, Klaus Voorman, Alan White, and Eric Clapton.  (Their set was released as the album \"Live Peace in Toronto 1969\".)  The video also features a selection of other acts: Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Bo Diddley.  The actual concert lasted twelve hours, but Pennebaker's documentary focuses mainly on the final hours of the concert.  At the time of the performance Yoko Ono's popularity was sufficiently low that the audience booed and left the Plastic Ono Band performance.  There was a similar response from film reviewers at the time.  The performances \"and this film have grown in interest and watchability since that time, particularly given the rarity of such thorough documentation of these key performers' work in concert.\" Take Me to the Land of Hell is the 2013 album by Yoko Ono as Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band.  It is her fifteenth solo album overall and Ono's third since reforming the Plastic Ono Band in 2009 with her son Sean Lennon.

Early life  After his father died when Monaghan was four years old, Monaghan's mother had difficulties raising him alone, and at age six, in 1943, Monaghan and his younger brother Jim ended up in an orphanage until their mother collected them again in 1949. The orphanage, St. Joseph Home for Children in Jackson, Michigan, was run by the Felician Sisters of Livonia; one of the nuns there inspired his devotion to the Catholic faith and he later entered St. Joseph's Seminary, in Grand Rapids, with the desire to eventually become a priest. Subsequently, he was expelled from the seminary for a series of disciplinary infractions. In 1956, Monaghan enlisted in the United States Marine Corps by mistake; he had meant to join the Army. He received an honorable discharge in 1959. PEPSU Road Transport Corporation (PRTC), the largest bus operator in Punjab state of India, is a state-run corporation headquartered at Patiala.

It is an unsympathetic yet comedic one-act portrayal of working class England, as played out by a couple and a mysterious young man who toys with their lives.  It was based on \"The Boy Hairdresser\", a novel by Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell.  The title and play are based on a few lines from poet and dramatist William Ernest Henley: \"Madam Life's a piece in bloom, / Death goes dogging everywhere: / She's the tenant of the room, / He's the ruffian on the stair.\"  \"Ruffian\" is not as renowned as other works such as \"Loot\" and \"What the Butler Saw\", but it is still staged on occasion. Kenneth Leith Halliwell (23 June 1926 – 9 August 1967) was a British actor, writer and collagist. He was the mentor, boyfriend and murderer of playwright Joe Orton. Childhood Halliwell was born in Bebington near Liverpool. He was very close to his mother; when he was 11, he witnessed her death from a wasp sting at their family home.Halliwell was a classics scholar at Wirral Grammar School, where he gained his Higher School Certificate in 1943. Eligible for military service in 1944, he registered as a conscientious objector, and was exempted conditional upon becoming a coal miner. After discharge in 1946, he acted for a time in Scotland and then returned home to act in Birkenhead. His father committed suicide in 1949 by inhaling coal-gas in a gas oven; Halliwell was the first to find the body the following morning, but he \"stepped over the body, put the kettle on, made a cup of tea and had a shave\" before he reported the death. Halliwell later moved to London to study drama at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), having inherited the family fortune. Relationship with Orton In 1951, he met fellow RADA student Joe Orton. Both men were struggling actors who became struggling writers; their common interests led to a lengthy romantic relationship. Halliwell, in the early years, seems to have been something of a mentor to Orton, who had had a rather cursory education, and helped to mould the writing style that would later be called \"Ortonesque\". The two men collaborated on several novels, including The Boy Hairdresser, which were not published until after their deaths.From January 1959, Orton and Halliwell were involved in the theft and defacement of public library books. Halliwell became an illicit collage artist, while Orton wrote the fake blurbs for the flyleaf of the dust jackets. After their trial in 1962 the two men were given custodial sentences: Halliwell was sent to HM Prison Ford in Sussex for six months and Orton went to Eastchurch in Kent.Orton's eventual success as a writer, which began not long after their release from prison, put a distance between the two men that Halliwell found difficult to handle. Prick Up Your Ears is a 1987 British film, directed by Stephen Frears, about the playwright Joe Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell.  The screenplay was written by Alan Bennett, based on the biography by John Lahr.  The film stars Gary Oldman as Orton, Alfred Molina as Halliwell, Wallace Shawn as Lahr and Vanessa Redgrave as Peggy Ramsay. John Kingsley \"Joe\" Orton (1 January 1933 – 9 August 1967) was an English playwright and author.  His public career was short but prolific, lasting from 1964 until his death three years later.  During this brief period he shocked, outraged, and amused audiences with his scandalous black comedies.  The adjective \"Ortonesque\" is sometimes used to refer to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism. John Kingsley Orton (1 January 1933 – 9 August 1967), known by the pen name of Joe Orton, was an English playwright, author, and diarist.

The adjective Ortonesque refers to work characterised by a similarly dark yet farcical cynicism.    Early life   Joe Orton was born on 1 January 1933 at Causeway Lane Maternity Hospital, Leicester, to William Arthur Orton and Elsie Mary Orton (née Bentley). William worked for Leicester County Borough Council as a gardener and Elsie worked in the local footwear industry until tuberculosis cost her a lung. At the time of Joe's birth, William and Mary were living with William's family at 261 Avenue Road Extension in Clarendon Park, Leicester.  Joe's younger brother, Douglas, was born in 1935. That year, the Ortons moved to 9 Fayrhurst Road on the Saffron Lane Estate, a council estate. Orton's younger sisters, Marilyn and Leonie, were born in 1939 and 1944, respectively. Orton attended Marriot Road Primary School but failed the eleven-plus exam after extended bouts of asthma, and so took a secretarial course at Clark's College in Leicester from 1945 to 1947. He began working as a junior clerk for £3 a week. Orton became interested in performing in theatre around 1949 and joined a number of dramatic societies, including the Leicester Dramatic Society. While working on amateur productions he was determined to improve his appearance and physique, buying bodybuilding courses, taking elocution lessons. He was accepted for a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in November 1950, and he left the East Midlands for London. His entrance into RADA was delayed until May 1951 by appendicitis. Orton met Kenneth Halliwell at RADA in 1951 and moved into a West Hampstead flat with him and two other students that June.

James Myers Thompson (September 27, 1906 – April 7, 1977) was an American prose writer and screenwriter, known for his hardboiled crime fiction. Thompson wrote more than thirty novels, the majority of which were original paperback publications, published from the late-1940s through mid-1950s. Despite some positive critical notice—notably by Anthony Boucher in The New York Times—he was little-recognized in his lifetime. Only after death did Thompson's literary stature grow. In the late 1980s, several of his novels were re-published in the Black Lizard series of re-discovered crime fiction. His best-regarded works include The Killer Inside Me, Savage Night, A Hell of a Woman and Pop. 1280. In these works, Thompson turned the derided crime genre into literature and art, featuring unreliable narrators, odd structure, and the quasi-surrealistic inner narratives of the last thoughts of his dying or dead characters. A number of Thompson's books were adapted as popular films, including The Getaway and The Grifters. The writer R.V. Cassill has suggested that of all crime fiction, Thompson's was the rawest and most harrowing; that neither Dashiell Hammett nor Raymond Chandler nor Horace McCoy ever \"wrote a book within miles of Thompson\". Similarly, in the introduction to Now and on Earth, Stephen King says he most admires Thompson's work because \"The guy was over the top. The guy was absolutely over the top. Big Jim didn't know the meaning of the word stop. There are three brave 'lets' inherent in the foregoing: He let himself see everything, he let himself write it down, then he let himself publish it.\" Thompson was called a \"Dimestore Dostoevsky\" by writer Geoffrey O'Brien. Film director Stephen Frears, who directed an adaptation of Thompson's The Grifters in 1990, also identified elements of Greek tragedy in his themes.    Life and career  Thompson's life was nearly as colorful as his fiction. His novels were considered semi-autobiographical, or, at least, inspired by his experiences.

(The theme of a once-prominent family overtaken by ill-fortune was featured in some of Thompson's works.)  Thompson's father, known as \"Big Jim\" Thompson, was a teacher for a decade in Burwell, Nebraska before his son's birth; his wife and Jim's mother, Birdie Myers, was a former student. He moved the family to Anadarko, Oklahoma Territory, and was elected sheriff of Caddo County.

Prick Up Your Ears is a 1987 British film, directed by Stephen Frears, about the playwright Joe Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell. The screenplay was written by Alan Bennett, based on the 1978 biography by John Lahr. The film stars Gary Oldman as Orton, Alfred Molina as Halliwell, Wallace Shawn as Lahr, and Vanessa Redgrave as Peggy Ramsay. Plot Islington, 9 August 1967. Literary agent Peggy Ramsay knocks on the door of playwright Joe Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell, but nobody opens. She calls the police. They find the corpses of the two men. A decade later theatre critic John Lahr visits Peggy Ramsay because he wants to write Orton's biography. They find Orton's diaries, and Peggy tells Lahr about Orton's life.Orton and Halliwell's relationship began at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. Orton started out as the uneducated youth to Halliwell's older faux-sophisticate. As the relationship progressed, however, Orton grew increasingly confident in his talent while Halliwell's writing stagnated. They fell into a parody of a traditional married couple, with Orton as the \"husband\" and Halliwell as the long-suffering and increasingly-ignored \"wife\" (a situation exacerbated at a time when being a sexually active homosexual was illegal). Orton was commissioned to write a screenplay for the Beatles. Halliwell got carried away in preparing for a meeting with the \"Fab Four\", but Orton was taken away for a meeting on his own. Finally, in August 1967, a despondent Halliwell kills Orton and commits suicide. Cast  Casting Ian McKellen was originally envisioned as Halliwell. McKellen explained: \"I needed a holiday – I'd been working so hard – so I just kept saying 'no, no, no', but when I saw the film I really regretted not having done it.\" Maggie Smith turned down the role of Ramsay, saying that she did not want to perturb her sons by starring in a film that featured homosexual promiscuity and murder.

Most notably, he has appeared in two self-titled films, the first in 1989 with Dolph Lundgren in the title role and the second in 2004 with Thomas Jane in the title role, as well as Punisher: War Zone, starring Ray Stevenson. Development The first film, known simply as The Punisher and starring Dolph Lundgren, is a film that was released theatrically internationally but straight to video in North America by Live Entertainment in 1989 that is most notable for lacking the character's signature skull. Marvel hired Jonathan Hensleigh to write and direct the 2004 film, starring Thomas Jane. The film was mainly based on two Punisher comic book stories; The Punisher: Year One and Welcome Back, Frank.A direct sequel was supposed to follow based on strong DVD sales, but the lack of a good script kept the project in development for over 3 years, and by the end both Jonathan Hensleigh and Thomas Jane pulled out. In June 2007, Lexi Alexander was hired to direct and Ray Stevenson was hired in July to play the Punisher in the newly titled Punisher: War Zone, which became a reboot, and not a sequel to 2004's The Punisher. This is the second time the film series has been rebooted, after the 2004 production rebooted 1989's The Punisher. The film was released on December 5, 2008. The films primarily focus on Frank's vigilante crusade after the death of his family. Live-action  The Punisher (1989) The Punisher appears in a self-titled film released by Live Entertainment, portrayed Dolph Lundgren. This version is described as an unnamed \"city's most wanted, and most mysterious, vigilante\" and a \"one-man weapon against crime\" who has killed 125 people in the five years preceding the film's events. Additionally, he is a former police officer, undercover detective, and U.S. Marine whose wife Julie and daughters Annie and Felice Castle were murdered by mobsters via a car bomb meant for him.

The best known ancient civilization of prehistoric East Asia was China, which flourished in the central plain region and continued until present day. The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas (commonly referred to simply as The Cosmopolitan or The Cosmo) is a resort casino and hotel on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It is owned by The Blackstone Group, Stonepeak Partners, and Cherng Family Trust and operated by MGM Resorts International. The resort includes a 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) casino and 3,033 rooms across two towers, as well as a 3,200-seat performance theater and various restaurants.The project was announced in 2004, by a joint venture that included real estate developer Ian Bruce Eichner. Construction on the hotel towers began in April 2007, following excavation work for an underground parking garage. Deutsche Bank helped finance the project, and eventually took over ownership in September 2008, after the original developers defaulted on a loan. The resort's interior underwent several redesigns, and plans to include a condo hotel component were ultimately scrapped.The Cosmopolitan opened on December 15, 2010, and at $3.9 billion, it was the most expensive Strip resort built up to that point. The resort proved to be popular, although casino revenue lagged behind other amenities. Deutsche Bank sold the resort to The Blackstone Group in 2014, for $1.7 billion. Blackstone made numerous changes which improved gaming revenue, and the company also negotiated a deal with the Culinary Workers Union, whose members had protested at the resort over the lack of a union contract. The resort operations were sold to MGM in 2022, while Cherng and Stonepeak joined Blackstone as owners. History  Background and construction Plans for the property were first announced in April 2004. The developer, 3700 Associates, was a joint venture formed by David Friedman (a former Las Vegas Sands executive), Ian Bruce Eichner (a real estate developer), and Soros Fund Management. The development group purchased the future site of the resort for $90 million, from a company controlled by Margaret Elardi, former owner of the New Frontier. Further details about the project, including the Cosmopolitan name, were released in November 2004.The project was expected to cost $1.5 billion, with the opening initially scheduled for late 2007 or early 2008. The majority of the resort's rooms were planned as condo hotel units. Sales began in February 2005, helping to finance construction of the resort. Takehiko Inoue (井上 雄彦, Inoue Takehiko, born 12 January 1967) is a Japanese manga artist. He is best known for the basketball series Slam Dunk (1990–1996), and the jidaigeki manga Vagabond, which are two of the best-selling manga series in history. Many of his works are about basketball, Inoue himself being a huge fan of the sport. His works sold in North America through Viz Media are Slam Dunk, Vagabond and Real, although Slam Dunk was earlier translated by Gutsoon! Entertainment. In 2012, Inoue became the first recipient of the Cultural Prize at the Asia Cosmopolitan Awards. Early life and education Inoue was born in Isa, Kagoshima, and was fond of drawing since he was a child. During elementary and junior high school, Inoue joined the kendo and basketball clubs, becoming captain of the latter. In his third year at Kagoshima Prefectural Oguchi High School, Inoue took a summer course at an art preparatory school with the plan of enrolling into an art university, but such schools were too expensive so he ended up going to Kumamoto University near his hometown. There he majored in literature. His submission to Weekly Shōnen Jump caught the attention of editor Taizo Nakamura and, at the age of 20, Inoue dropped out of college to move to Tokyo and pursue a career as a manga artist. Career Before his debut, Inoue was an assistant to Tsukasa Hojo on City Hunter. He made his debut in 1988, when Purple Kaede (楓パープル) appeared in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine. It won the 35th annual Tezuka Award. His first serialization was in 1989 with Chameleon Jail, for which he was the illustrator of a story written by Kazuhiko Watanabe.Inoue's first real fame came with his next manga, Slam Dunk, about a basketball team from Shohoku High School. It was published in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1990 to 1996 and has sold over 170 million copies worldwide. In 1995 it received the 40th annual Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen manga and in 2007 was declared Japan's favorite manga. East Asia is the eastern subregion of the Asian continent, which can be defined in either geographical or ethno-cultural terms.  Geographically and geopolitically, it includes China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan; it covers about 12000000 km2 , or about 28% of the Asian continent.  GDP(PPP) of East Asia is 32.4 trillion while Nominal GDP is 19.1 trillion USD. The Nara period (奈良時代 , \"Nara jidai\" ) of the history of Japan covers the years from AD 710 to 794.  Empress Genmei established the capital of Heijō-kyō (present-day Nara).  Except for a five-year period (740–745), when the capital was briefly moved again, it remained the capital of Japanese civilization until Emperor Kanmu established a new capital, Nagaoka-kyō, in 784, before moving to Heian-kyō, or Kyoto, a decade later in 794. Japan (Japanese: 日本 \"Nippon\" ] or \"Nihon\" ] ; formally 日本国 \"  \" or \"Nihon-koku\", meaning \"State of Japan\") is a sovereign island nation in East Asia.  Located in the Pacific Ocean, it lies off the eastern coast of the Asian mainland and stretches from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the southwest. Japan is an island country in East Asia, located in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of the Asian mainland. It is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea in the south. The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands—Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu—and thousands of smaller islands, covering around 380,000 square kilometres (150,000 sq mi). With a population of more than 125 million as of 2020, Japan is the 11th most populous country. Tokyo is its capital and largest city. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. About three-quarters of the country's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested, concentrating its agriculture and highly urbanized population along its eastern coastal plains. Greater Tokyo is the world's most populous metropolitan area, with more than 38 million inhabitants as of 2016. Part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, Japan's islands are prone to destructive earthquakes and tsunamis. The first known habitation of the archipelago dates to the Upper Paleolithic, with the beginning Japanese Paleolithic dating to circa 36,000 BC. Between the fourth and sixth centuries, its kingdoms were united under an emperor in Nara, and later Heian-kyō. From the 12th century, actual power was held by military dictators (shōgun) and feudal lords (daimyō), and enforced by warrior nobility (samurai). After rule by the Kamakura and Ashikaga shogunates and a century of warring states, Japan was unified in 1600 by the Tokugawa shogunate, which implemented an isolationist foreign policy. In 1853, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan pursued rapid industrialization and modernization, as well as militarism and overseas colonization. In 1937, Japan invaded China, and in 1941 attacked the United States and European colonial powers, entering World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under Allied occupation.

The East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) or East Asia Economic Group (EAEG) was a regional free trade zone (FTA) proposed in 1997 by former Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad and encompasses the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.  Japan though refused participation due to the exclusion of the Western nations, which were already members of APEC and many other notable regional organizations in East Asia. Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia Japan first participated at the Olympic Games in 1912, and has competed at almost every Games since then. The nation was not invited to the 1948 Games after World War II, and was part of the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.Japan won its first medals in 1920, and its first gold medals in 1928. Japanese athletes have won 497 medals at the Summer Olympic Games (except art competitions), with the most gold medals won in Judo, Skateboarding, and Karate, as of the end of the 2020 Summer Olympics. Japan has also won 58 medals at the Winter Olympic Games. Its most successful Olympics are the 1964 and 2020 Games, both hosted in Tokyo. The Japanese Olympic Committee was created in 1911 and recognized in 1912.

It was held in the capital Tokyo. It was also the first time it was held in Asia. 1972 Winter Olympics The 1972 Winter Olympics marks the second time Olympics held in Japan. It was the first time held outside Tokyo because it was held at Sapporo.Because of its snowy geographic, Japan would hosts its first Winter Olympics. It was also the first winter olympics held in Asia. 1998 Winter Olympics The 1998 Winter Olympics was the third time Japan hosted the Olympics and second for Winter. Was held at Nagano. The motto of the games is Coexistence with Nature (自然との共存) 2020 Summer Olympics The 2020 Summer Olympics marks the fourth time the Olympics was held in Japan. It was the first time it was held one year late (2021 instead of 2020) following the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. It marks the second time it was held in Tokyo. Its motto was United by Emotion (感動で、私たちはひとつになる). Sento-kun (せんとくん ) is a yuru-chara mascot created by Nara City Office to commemorate the 1300th anniversary of Nara Heijō-kyō, the ancient capital of Japan, in 2010. The Empire of Japan, also referred to as the Japanese Empire or Imperial Japan, was the Japanese nation-state that existed from the Meiji Restoration in 1868 until the enactment of the reformed Constitution of Japan in 1947. From 29 August 1910 until 2 September 1945, it administered the naichi (the Japanese archipelago and post-1943 Karafuto) and the gaichi (Korea, Taiwan, Kwantung Leased Territory, and pre-1943 Karafuto). The South Seas Mandate was a single Japanese dependent territory in the name of the League of Nations under Japanese administration. In the closing stages of World War II, with Japan defeated alongside the rest of the Axis, the formalized Japanese Instrument of Surrender was issued in compliance with the Potsdam Declaration of the victorious Allies, and Japanese de facto territory subsequently shrunk to cover only the Japanese archipelago as it is today.Under the slogans of fukoku kyōhei and shokusan kōgyō, which followed the Boshin War and the restoration of power to the Emperor from the Shogun, Japan underwent a period of large-scale industrialization and militarization, often regarded as the fastest modernization of any country to date. All of these aspects contributed to Japan's emergence as a great power following the First Sino-Japanese War, the Boxer Rebellion, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War I. Economic and political turmoil in the 1920s, including the Great Depression, led to the rise of militarism, nationalism, statism and authoritarianism, and this ideological shift eventually culminated in Japan joining the Axis alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and also conquering a large part of the Asia-Pacific. During this period, the Japanese army committed many atrocities, including the Nanjing Massacre. However, there has been a debate over defining the political system of Japan as a dictatorship.The Imperial Japanese Armed Forces initially achieved large-scale military successes during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War. However, from 1942 onwards, and particularly after decisive Allied advances at Midway Atoll and Guadalcanal, Japan was forced to adopt a defensive stance against the United States. The American-led island-hopping campaign led to the eventual loss of many of Japan's Oceanian island possessions in the following three years. Lili Yan Ing is an Indonesian economist.

        "question": "Which TV show was hosted by a former professional wrestler known by the ring name Goldberg?",
        "answer": "Automaniac",
        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Which TV show was hosted by a former professional wrestler known by the ring name Goldberg?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nThe straight-five engine (also referred to as an inline-five engine; abbreviated I5 or L5) is a piston engine with five cylinders mounted in a straight line along the crankshaft.Although less common than straight-four engines and straight-six engines, straight-five engine designs have been used by automobile manufacturers since the late 1930s.  The most notable examples include the Mercedes Benz's diesel engines from 1974 to 2006 and Audi's petrol engines from 1979 to the present. Straight-five engines are smoother running than straight-four engines and shorter than straight-six engines. However, achieving consistent fueling across all cylinders was problematic prior to the adoption of fuel injection. Characteristics Straight-five engines are typically shorter than straight-six engines, making them easier to fit transversely in an engine bay. They are also smoother than straight-four engines, and are narrower than V engines and flat engines. Engine balance and vibration Five-cylinder engines have a crankshaft with 72 degree angles. Amongst four-stroke engines, an advantage of engines with five or more cylinders is that the power strokes are overlapping if the engine has an even firing order.A disadvantage of the odd number of cylinders in a straight-five engine is it results in imperfect primary and secondary engine balance, unlike a straight-six engine which has perfect primary and secondary balance. Counterweights on the crankshaft can be used to reduce the vibrations from these imbalances.  This method is also used in straight-four engines. Firing order Most four-stroke straight-five engines use a firing order of 1-2-4-5-3. This firing order results in the minimal primary (crank speed) rocking couple, and is used by the Volvo Modular engine, VW/Audi straight-five engine, General Motors Atlas engine and Honda G engine. Straight-five  engines typically have a 72 degree crankshaft design.All two stroke straight-five engines are limited in having a single firing order for a given crank configuration; because a complete cycle occurs every 360 degrees, there is no chance to share piston phases without having simultaneous ignitions, so the straight-five is at no disadvantage in this case. Some two-stroke outboard engines, e.g. the Mercury Marine Force 150 engine use a firing order of 1-5-2-3-4. Carburettors and fuel injection The use of straight-five petrol engines in mass production cars only became truly viable with the advent of reliable fuel injection. Wilhelm Baumann (September 4, 1884 – September 15, 1972), better known as Billy Sandow, was an American professional wrestler and promoter.  He is best remembered as the manager of professional wrestler Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis and a subsequent member of the famed Gold Dust Trio promotion that changed the face of the industry during the 1920s (along with Lewis and Joseph \"Toots\" Mondt).  He may have taken his ring name from Eugen Sandow, a professional wrestler and strongman in the late 19th century; in turn, former WWE wrestler Damien Sandow would adopt his own ring name in honor of Sandow almost a century later.  Sandow also served as manager for such wrestling champions as Billy Jenkins, Marin Plestina, Jumping Joe Savoldi and Everett Marshall, and also used the ring name The Zebra Kid in 1951.  He was a charter inductee of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996. Ángel Acevedo (born January 27, 1945) is a Puerto Rican retired professional wrestler known by his ring name The Cuban Assassin and for his appearances with Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling, World Wrestling Council and Stampede Wrestling.  Ángel Acevedo is a permanent resident of Canada and resides in Calgary, Alberta.  Acevedo's son, Richie Acevedo, was also a wrestler for many years but retired in 2009.  Acevedo allowed Fidel Sierra to use the Cuban Assassin name as well, as long as he did not use it in Japan, which has led to some mistakenly crediting Acevedo and Sierra with championships they did not win. The Volkswagen Audi Group (VAG) AEB Engine is a line of mechanically-similar 1.8-liter, 20-valve, turbocharged, inline-four engines, designed, developed, and produced by the Volkswagen Group, and used in the various models, between 1993 and 2010.

The Goldberg win streak was a lengthy series of victories that established the character of American professional wrestler Goldberg, following his debut on WCW Monday Nitro on September 22, 1997. The unprecedented win streak proved to be essential in making Goldberg the breakout star of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), propelling the rookie wrestler to main event status within a year of his first match, and would become a tool used by other promotions to build young stars into main event players. Background  Beginnings During the rehab following his NFL injury, Goldberg began powerlifting and mixed martial arts training. He was spotted by Lex Luger and Sting who urged him to try professional wrestling. Although not a fan of professional wrestling, he saw it as an alternative to his fledgling football career and began training at the WCW Power Plant.Training under the tutelage of DeWayne Bruce, he made his debut as Bill Gold on a dark match at a Monday Nitro event on June 23, 1997 where he defeated Bruce (wrestling as Sgt. Buddy Lee Parker). He also faced and defeated Buddy Landell (Saturday Night dark match), Hugh Morrus (house show), Chip Minton (Nitro dark match), and John Betcha (house show). His final pre-televised appearance was in a dark match on July 24 at a Saturday Night taping in a loss to Chad Fortune. The streak begins Now 5–1, Bill Goldberg had yet to be seen on television. As such, he was \"undefeated\" when he made his televised debut on Monday Nitro on September 22, 1997. Behind the scenes it was WCW announcer Mike Tenay who came up with the concept of the Goldberg Win Streak. Goldberg was booked to win over Morrus, and thus began a win streak that carried over onto WCW Saturday Night and non-televised house shows. The longer the streak became, the more popular the Goldberg character became.After rampaging through most of WCW's undercard of wrestlers, Goldberg faced Raven on the April 20 edition of Monday Nitro and captured the United States Heavyweight Championship. By June he had eclipsed 100 wins, and was getting over as a main eventer.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Charleston Community Unit School District 1 is a conglomerate of six schools, with all but one located in Charleston itself: four elementary schools, one middle school, and one high school form the makeup of the district.  Education begins at a prekindergarten level, and those living in the Charleston area attend Mark Twain Elementary School, which prepares early youth for schooling by taking them through prekindergarten and kindergarten under the supervision of principal Terry Diss.  Students who live in the far east reaches of Coles County may attend Ashmore Elementary School, which is based in a northeasterly village by the same name; Ashmore's distance from the other schools permits it to educate a larger range of students for the sake of efficiency.  The school educates students from kindergarten through grade four, and also runs a prekindergarten program.  Ashmore is also governed by Terry Diss.  Students who graduate from Mark Twain move onwards to Carl Sandburg Elementary School, which educates those in grades one, two, and three under principal Chad Burgett.  At Jefferson Elementary School in Charleston, the student bodies from both Carl Sandburg Elementary School and Ashmore Elementary School are consolidated.  Students from grades four through six are taught in the facility under the supervision of principal Deborah Poffinbarger.  District students graduating from Jefferson are moved to Charleston Middle School, where they are taught as seventh and eighth graders; the school principal here is Sandy Wilson.  The last branch of education that Charleston's school district can provide is the education of adolescents in the grades nine through twelve at Charleston High School, which is run by principal Trevor Doughty.  The superintendent of the schools in the district as of the 2007-08 school year was Dr. William Hill, although is considered as an interim;lastly, the mascots of the district and its middle and high schools are the Trojans, while the mascot of Jefferson Elementary School is the bulldog. A dance party (also referred to as a dance) is a social gathering where dancing is the primary activity. Some dance parties are held in a casual setting and open to the public, such as a rave, or those held in nightclubs.Other types of dance parties may be a formal or semi-formal private event which often require guests to don formal wear and have an invitation or membership within the community hosting the event, such as school dances and cotillions.Guests of formal dances often attend in pairs, as consorts or \"dates\" for one another. The term \"stag\" refers to going without a consort to a dance organized for couples. Dances commonly take place during the evening, although some are held earlier during the daytime; such events are known as tea dances. Casual dances Casual dances are dances that do not have a formal dress requirement; these may include school and community events, raves, evening entertainments provided for guests aboard a cruise ship, and events organized for certain holidays, such as Halloween and Mardi Gras. School dances A school dance is a dance sponsored by a school, and may be casual or formal. Casual school dances were originally limited to Western countries, although schools in other countries are beginning to adopt such events. There are some schools, such as Arlington High School in Arlington, Massachusetts, that prohibit school-hosted dances, citing sex and alcohol problems. In the United States One of the most significant school dances is prom, a relatively formal event normally reserved for Junior grade and Senior grade students. Some schools host a winter formal, a similar event, for the lower grades. In the 1950s, informal school dances in the United States were often called sock hops. The traditional Sadie Hawkins dance may be formal or semi-formal. Live band dance A live band dance is an event where the means of serving the dancefloor involves the use of a live band. Before the rise of discothèques and DJ-based dancefloors with recorded music (prior to the 1950s), live bands were the ubiquitous means of serving the dancefloor. Along with that, slow-dancing was the primary method of dancing at the time.  However; the rise of Rock and Roll music initially made it hard for people to dance when it was popularized in the early 1950s, however people quickly adapted to it and started dancing at higher speeds almost coinciding the rise of DJ-based dancefloors. Formal wear or full dress  is the Western dress code category applicable for the most formal occasions, such as weddings, christenings, confirmations, funerals, Easter and Christmas traditions, in addition to certain state dinners, audiences, balls, and horse racing events. Generally permitted other alternatives, though, are the most formal versions of ceremonial dresses (including court dresses, diplomatic uniforms and academic dresses), full dress uniforms, religious clothing, national costumes, and most rarely frock coats (which preceded morning coat as default formal day wear 1820s-1920s). In addition, formal wear is often instructed to be worn with official full size orders and medals.The protocol indicating particularly men's traditional formal wear has remained virtually unchanged since the early 20th century. Despite decline following the counterculture of the 1960s, it remains observed in formal settings influenced by Western culture: notably around Europe, the Americas, South Africa, Australia, as well as Japan. For women, although fundamental customs for formal ball gowns (and wedding gowns) likewise apply, changes in fashion have been more dynamic. Traditional formal headgear for men is the top hat, and for women picture hats etc. of a range of interpretations. Shoes for men are dress shoes, dress boots or pumps and for women heeled dress pumps. In western countries, a \"formal\" or white tie dress code typically means tailcoats for men and evening dresses for women. The most formal dress for women is a full-length ball or evening gown with evening gloves. Some white tie functions also request that the women wear long gloves past the elbow.Formal wear being the most formal dress code, it is followed by semi-formal wear, equivalently based around daytime black lounge suit, and evening black tie (dinner suit/tuxedo), and evening gown for women. The male lounge suit and female cocktail dress in turn only comes after this level, traditionally associated with informal attire. Travis Unified School District is a Unified School District located in Fairfield.  It serves students from Fairfield, Vacaville and Travis A.F.B. in a total of 9 schools throughout its district.  These schools include 1 high school, 1 alternative high school, 1 middle school, 2 alternative middle schools and 5 elementary schools.  The elementary schools are Scandia Elementary School, Travis Elementary School, Center Elementary School, Cambridge Elementary School, and Foxboro Elementary School.  The middle schools include 2 alternative schools in Travis Independent Study School and Travis Community Day School as well as a public middle school in Golden West Middle School.  The high schools include 1 alternative high school in Travis Education Center (TEC) and 1 public high school in Vanden High School. Sadie Hawkins Day is an American folk event and pseudo-holiday originated by Al Capp's hillbilly comic strip Li'l Abner (1934–1977). The annual comic strip storyline inspired real-world Sadie Hawkins events, the premise of which is that women ask men for a date or dancing. \"Sadie Hawkins Day\" was introduced in the comic strip on November 15, 1937; the storyline ran until the beginning of December. The storyline was revisited the following October/November, and inspired a fad on college campuses. By 1939, Life reported that 201 colleges in 188 cities held a Sadie Hawkins Day event. Comic strip In Li'l Abner, Sadie Hawkins was the daughter of Mayor Hekzebiah Hawkins, one of Dogpatch's earliest settlers and the \"homeliest gal in all them hills\". She grew frantic waiting for suitors until she reached age 35 and was still a spinster, and her father was worried about her living at home for the rest of her life. In desperation, he called together all the unmarried men of Dogpatch and declared it \"Sadie Hawkins Day\". A foot race was decreed with Sadie pursuing the town's eligible bachelors. If Sadie caught one of them, he would be forced to marry her. She was specifically interested in a handsome boy named Adam who was already in a courtship with Theresa, whose father was the area's largest potato farmer. Unlike Sadie, Theresa had a number of courtship offers.As the event became a tradition in the comic strip, Capp added more story elements. Each year, the Sadie Hawkins storyline begins with a prophecy by Old Man Mose, who gives Li'l Abner a cryptic clue about the end of the storyline, which always comes true in a roundabout, surprising way. The storyline sometimes also includes the Sadie Hawkins Eve Dance which is held on the previous evening, when the young women wear hobnailed boots and stomp on their partners' feet, to make the bachelors run slower during the event. Impact Inspired by Capp's satiric race in which eligible women chase down terrified bachelors for the purposes of wedlock, the event reverses the cultural norms of men as the romantic pursuers. In the United States and Canada, the Sadie Hawkins Dance is a usually informal dance sponsored by a high school, middle school or college, in which female students invite male students.  This is contrary to the custom of male students typically inviting female students to school dances such as prom in the spring and Homecoming in the fall. == History ==\nThe Sadie Hawkins dance is named after the Li'l Abner comic strip character Sadie Hawkins, created by cartoonist Al Capp. In the strip, Sadie Hawkins Day fell on a given day in November, on which the unmarried women of Dogpatch would chase the bachelors and \"marry up\" with the ones that they caught. The event was introduced in a daily strip that ran on November 15, 1937. By 1939, Sadie Hawkins events were held at over 200 colleges, according to Life magazine.\nThe date for Sadie Hawkins Day most commonly reported is November 13, two days before the first appearance in the comics, but the exact date was never actually specified by Al Capp until he finally set it as November 26 in his last Li'l Abner daily strip on November 5, 1977.\n\n\n== Similar dance events ==\nThe Tolo Dance in the Pacific Northwest began several decades before Capp's comic strip. The word tolo comes from the University of Washington's Mortar Board, which began as an all-women's honor society called the \"Tolo Club\", from the Chinook word for success and achievement. To raise funds, the group held a dance where women asked men.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGender roles\nLeap year, for traditions on women proposing marriage\nPowder Puff, a football game pitting girls against girls\nWinter Formal, a formal dance that may be had instead of Sadie Hawkins dances from January through March == History ==\nThe Sadie Hawkins dance is named after the Li'l Abner comic strip character Sadie Hawkins, created by cartoonist Al Capp. In the strip, Sadie Hawkins Day fell on a given day in November, on which the unmarried women of Dogpatch would chase the bachelors and \"marry up\" with the ones that they caught.

Boone High School is a public high school in Orlando, Florida, United States.  Built in 1952, the school is one of twenty high schools in the Orange County Public Schools system, created to accommodate the growing number of students at Orlando High School.  The plan involved building two high schools, Orlando North and Orlando South, to take the place of Orlando High School and convert the old high school facilities into what is now Howard Middle School.  The last principal of Orlando High School, William R. Boone, died of a heart condition before the two new schools were opened, so the school board dedicated one of the high schools in his memory, then christened Orlando North as Edgewater High School after its surrounding community. Susie Q is a 1996 fantasy-comedy television film directed by John Blizek and starring Justin Whalin, Amy Jo Johnson and Shelley Long. It originally aired on Super RTL in Germany, followed by Disney Channel's airing of it in the United States on October 3, 1996, as a Disney Channel Premiere Film. The film tells the story of a young woman dying with her beau (Bentley Mitchum) on her way to their Winter Formal back in the mid-1950s and coming back to her old house 40 years later in order to help her parents avoid being kicked out of their trailer park home. Later, Zach (Whalin) moves into Susie's (Johnson) old house, but he is the only one who is able to see Susie.The film was given a \"TV-G\" rating, and was already cut for some profanity, but not all, when it primarily aired on the Disney Channel. This film is the only Disney-related title produced by Saban Entertainment and its extensions. As a project commissioned by Disney on behalf of Super RTL and Disney Channel, it was produced by Saban's adult unit Libra Pictures rather than the main, child-friendly Saban output. It was released as a Disney Channel Premiere Film (DCPF) in 1996, a year before Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOM) made its debut in 1997. However, Disney never owned the Susie Q copyrights until Disney in 2001 acquired Fox Family Worldwide, which includes Saban Entertainment/Libra Pictures and its assets. Susie Q is the only Saban Entertainment property which contains Disney logos and images in promotional and distributional materials also to be directly Disney-branded among the properties including produced in company's both of Saban and Disney era. Consequently Susie Q rights are currently held by The Walt Disney Company through its subsidiary BVS Entertainment.

Kataev is credited with suggesting the idea for \"The Twelve Chairs\" to his brother Yevgeni Petrov and Ilya Ilf.  In return, Kataev insisted that the novel be dedicated to him, in all editions and translations.  Kataev's relentless imagination, sensitivity, and originality made him one of the most distinguished Soviet writers.

Thus it's no coincidence that the main character in Kataev's semi-autobiographical novel A White Sail Gleams is named Pyotr Bachei. His father came from a long line of Russian clergy originally from Vyatka where Valentin's grandfather served as a protoiereus. His maternal grandfather was a major general in the Imperial Russian Army. Despite the obvious class conflict, Kataev never tried to hide his origins during the Soviet period.

It is located in Moscow, Russia, and was founded in 1930.  In Russian Federation the education in universities is available in Russian medium only.  Therefore, before the main education courses would start, the foreign applicants to university courses should pass the Preliminary course for training in Russian language, followed by the State Test in Russian language (called Teaching Russian as a Foreign Language – TORFL).  Fifteen years ago MPEI (as one of few such Russian universities) launched the program of education for foreign students in English medium, however in only one specialty – Computer Engineering.  MPEI invested considerate time and resources into this program, they selected a group of leading professors who spoke English fluently, who in turn prepared the educational materials in English.  Now MPEI accepts annually one full group of foreign students who speak English fluently for this IT educational program in English Language.  All classes here are provided in English, hence the students in this program do not require the preliminary training in Russian language, i.e. the educational period becomes one year shorter.  The annual tuition fee for this program however is more expensive, since this program is conducted in English, unlike the rest of the programs.

It originated in the center of Mexico, it was developed in this country in the 1970s, product of the accidental or intentional crosses of the American Pit Bull Terrier with the now extinct Mexican Bulldog, street dogs, American Bully, Pitbull Blue, Staffordshire bull terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, and probably with the Boxer.  Its name comes from the Mexican slang \"Chamuco\", which means devil because of its temperament and tenacity.  Also it called Mexican pitbull or miniature pitbull, but actually is Dogo of Mexican origin. Ch.  Rocky Top's Sundance Kid (\"aka: \"Rufus\"\") (April 8, 2000 – August 9, 2012), is a Bull Terrier who is best known for being the 2006 Best In Show winner at the Westminster Dog Show.  He is the first Colored Bull Terrier to win Best in Show at Westminster, with the only other victory for his breed going to a White Bull Terrier in 1918.  He also won Best in Show at the National Dog Show in 2005, and on retirement trained as a therapy dog.  He is the most successful Colored Bull Terrier Show Dog of all time. Five ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Galgo, after the Galgo Español, the Spanish greyhound: HMS Galgo (1742) was a Spanish privateer sloop of twelve 4-pounder (Spanish) guns and 178 tons burthen that Hampshire captured in 1742. She was sold 24 March 1743.HMS Galgo (1743) was a sloop of ten 6-pounder guns and 272 tons burthen, launched in 1743 as HMS Galgo. She was renamed HMS Swallow that year, but was wrecked at the end of 1744.HMS Galgo (1745)HMS Galgo (1799) was a Spanish 16-gun corvette captured in 1799 that foundered in 1800.HMS Galgo (1801) was the mercantile Garland, purchased in 1801 and sold in 1814. Pit bull is an umbrella term for several types of dog believed to have descended from bull and terriers. In the United States, the term is usually considered to include the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and sometimes the American Bulldog, along with any crossbred dog that shares certain physical characteristics with these breeds. In other countries, including the United Kingdom, the term is used as an abbreviation of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed specifically, while the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is not considered a pit bull. Most pit bull–type dogs descend from the British bull and terrier, a 19th-century dog-fighting type developed from crosses between the Old English Bulldog and the Old English Terrier.Pit bull–type dogs have a controversial reputation as pets internationally, due to their history in dog fighting, the number of high-profile attacks documented in the media over decades, and their proclivity to latching on while biting. Proponents of the type and advocates of regulation have engaged in a highly contentious nature-versus-nurture debate over whether aggressive tendencies in pit bulls may be appropriately attributed to owners' poor care for and competency to handle the dog or inherent qualities owing to their breeding for fighting purposes. Numerous advocacy organizations have been created in defense of the pit bull, usually led by pit bull owners. While some studies have argued that the type is not disproportionately dangerous, offering competing interpretations on dog bite statistics, independent organizations have published statistics based on hospital records showing pit bulls are responsible for more than half of dog bite incidents among all breeds despite comprising only 6% of pet dogs.: 18, 49  Some insurance companies will not cover pit bulls (along with Rottweilers and wolf hybrids) because these particular dogs cause a disproportionate rate of bite incidents. Dog bite severity varies by the breed of dog, and studies have found that pit bull–type dogs have both a high rate of reported bites and a high rate of severe injuries, compared to other non–pit bull–type dogs.Pit bull–type dogs are extensively used in the United States for dogfighting, a practice that has continued despite being outlawed. Several nations and jurisdictions restrict the ownership of pit bull–type dogs through breed-specific legislation. The Galgo Español (\"Spanish galgo\") or Spanish greyhound is an ancient breed of dog, specifically a member of the sighthound family. The Galgo Español, or Spanish Greyhound, is an ancient breed of dog, specifically a member of the sighthound family. The English greyhound is possibly a descendant of the Spanish greyhound and, for several years in the 20th century, some breeders did cross-breed Galgos and Greyhounds in order to produce faster and more powerful Galgos, specifically for track racing purposes.    Description     Appearance   Galgos are similar in appearance to Greyhounds, but are distinctly different in their conformation. Galgos are higher in the rear than in the front and have flatter muscling than a Greyhound, which is characteristic of endurance runners. They also tend to be smaller, lighter in build, have longer tails and have a very long, streamlined head that gives the impression of larger ears. Their chests are not as deep as a Greyhound's and should not reach the point of the elbow.   Unlike Greyhounds, Galgos come in two coat types: smooth and rough. The rough coat can provide extra protection from skin injuries while running in the field. They come in a variety of colors and coat patterns. Main colors are barcino or atigrado (brindle), negro (black), barquillo (golden), tostado (toasted), canela (cinnamon), amarillo (yellow), rojo (red), blanco (white), berrendo (white with patches) or pío (any colour with white muzzle and forehead).    Temperament  Galgos have a similar nature to Greyhounds. They are calm, quiet, gentle, and laid back; happy to sleep their day away on their backs on a sofa. More than 90% of Galgos can be considered cat-friendly. Almost all Galgos are friendly towards other dogs and small dogs. Galgos are good with children; they possess a calm temperament so there is less risk of a child being knocked over or jumped on than with a more excitable breed. They have a reserved personality and a tendency towards shyness, so it is important that they be socialized early in life. This way, they grow up to be comfortable around strange people, dogs, and locations.    Health   Like many other sighthounds, Galgos are a fairly healthy breed, although they are sensitive to anaesthesia.

The American Staffordshire Terrier, also known as \"Amstaff\" (in the United States) or simply \"Stafford\", is a medium-sized, short-coated American dog breed.  It is one of several breeds commonly known as pit bulls.  In the early part of the twentieth century the breed gained social stature and was accepted by the American Kennel Club in 1936.  The name was changed to reflect difference from the Staffordshire Bull Terrier of England. The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is a dog breed.  It is a medium-sized, solidly-built, intelligent, short-haired dog whose early ancestors came from the British Isles.  When compared with the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier (another breed within the type commonly called pit bulls), the American Pit Bull Terrier is larger by margins of 6 - in height and 25 - in weight.  The American Pit Bull Terrier varies in size.  Males normally are about 18-21 inches (45–53 cm) in height and around 35-60 pounds (15–27 kg) in weight.  Females are normally around 17-20 inches (43–50 cm) in height and 30-50 pounds (13–22 kg) in weight. Luke the Dog (1913-1926) was a Staffordshire Bull Terrier that performed as a recurring character in American silent comedy shorts between 1914 and 1920.  He was also the personal pet of actress Minta Durfee and her husband, the comedian and director Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle.  Although Luke never came close to attaining the stardom of the various dogs that portrayed Rin Tin Tin, Pete the Pup, or Lassie, he accomplished stunts on camera that even those later canine colleagues may have found difficult or impossible to duplicate.  Luke for six years gained widespread popularity among movie audiences, appearing in one- and two-reelers for Keystone Studios, Comique Film Company, and Joseph M. Schenck Productions.  The bull terrier shared screen time not only with Arbuckle and Durfee but also with other stars and top supporting players of the silent era, including Mabel Normand, Buster Keaton, Al St. John, Molly Malone, Joe Roberts, Betty Compson, and Edgar Kennedy. A hound is a type of hunting dog used by hunters to track or chase prey. Description Hounds can be contrasted with gun dogs that assist hunters by identifying prey and/or recovering shot quarry. The hound breeds were the first hunting dogs. They have either a powerful sense of smell, great speed, or both. There are three types of hound, with several breeds type:Sighthounds (also called gazehounds) follow prey predominantly by speed, keeping it in sight. These dogs are fast and assist hunters in catching game: fox, hare, deer, and elk.Scenthounds follow prey or others (like missing people) by tracking its scent. These dogs have endurance, but are not fast runners.The remaining breeds of hound follow their prey using both sight and scent. They are difficult to classify, as they are neither strictly sighthounds nor strictly scenthounds.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier, also called the Staffy or Stafford, is a purebred dog of small to medium size in the terrier group that originated in the northern parts of Birmingham and in the Black Country of Staffordshire, for which it is named. They descended from 19th-century bull terriers that were developed by crossing bulldogs with various terriers to create a generic type of dog generally known as bull and terriers. Staffords share the same ancestry with the modern Bull Terrier, although the two breeds developed along independent lines, and do not resemble each other. Modern Staffords more closely resemble the old type of bull terrier, and were first recognised as a purebred dog breed by The Kennel Club of Great Britain in 1935. Within the broad sweep of dog history, the story behind the modern Stafford is rather brief and somewhat confusing because of the multiple aliases attached to these dogs in centuries past, such as the \"Patched Fighting Terrier\", \"Staffordshire Pit-dog\", \"Brindle Bull\", and \"Bull-and-Terrier\". Similar crosses also had aliases such as half-and-halves and half-breds. Blood sports such as bull-baiting and bear-baiting were outlawed with the passing of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 by Parliament, making it illegal to bait animals but promoting the matching of dogs against each other. Dog breeders migrated away from the heavier bulldogs, and introduced terrier blood into their crosses for gameness and agility. These bull and terrier crosses produced the ancestral breeding stock that, over the course of decades, evolved into the modern conformation show dogs we know today as the Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the Bull Terrier. It was shortly before the American Civil War that immigrants from Great Britain brought their bull and terrier crossbreeds into the U.S. They became the ancestral progenitors of the  American Staffordshire Terrier (AmStaff), Miniature Bull Terrier, Boston Terrier, and American Pit Bull Terrier.    History   The unregulated breeding history and inconsistent genetic makeup of the Stafford's early ancestry have led to misconceptions about its origins.: 8–11  Individual types and styles of crossbred dogs varied by geographic region. For example, the progeny from one area may have a higher percentage of terrier than bulldog, whereas other reports claim that bulldog to terrier was preferred over bull and terrier to bull terrier.

Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog.  Formal breeds often considered in North America to be of the pit bull type include the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.  The American Bulldog is also sometimes included.  Many of these breeds were originally developed as fighting dogs from cross breeding bull-baiting dogs (used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls) and terriers.  After the use of dogs in blood sports was banned, such dogs were used as catch dogs in the United States for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt and drive livestock, and as family companions.  Despite dog fighting now being illegal in the United States, it still exists as an underground activity, and pit bulls are a common breed of choice. The Bull and Terrier is a breed of dog that was the progenitor of the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, English Bull Terrier and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The American Staffordshire Terrier, also known as the AmStaff, is a medium-sized, short-coated American dog breed recognized by the American Kennel Club, but not the United Kennel Club, which instead allows American Staffordshire Terriers to be registered under the American Pit Bull Terrier breed.The height of an American Staffordshire Terrier is 18–19 in (46–48 cm) tall and weighs between 40–70 lb (18–32 kg). The American Kennel Club (AKC) describes the breed as \"confident, smart and good-natured\". American Staffordshire Terriers are not to be confused with American Pit Bull Terriers, though the American Pit Bull Terrier has similar ancestry they are two distinct breeds. It also should not be confused with the \"Staffy\" Staffordshire Bull Terrier of the United Kingdom. History Some varieties of bull-and-terrier from the British Isles began to find their way into America as early as 1850. The name Staffordshire Terrier was approved because the ancestors of the breed originally came from Staffordshire, England. The name of the breed was revised on January 1, 1969, to American Staffordshire Terrier to distinguish it from the British Staffordshire Bull Terrier, which is a completely different type of purebred show dog that was recognized in England in 1935.The AKC opened the AmStaff Stud Book to UKC dogs a few more times until the 1970s. Since then, both parents had to be AKC registered in order to register the offspring. Breed selection was based entirely on conformation and established breed standards that, for decades, has transformed the American Staffordshire Terrier into a much different breed from the American Pit Bull Terrier. Temperament According to the American Kennel Club, these dogs are \"smart, confident, good-natured companions. Their courage is proverbial. A responsibly bred, well-socialized AmStaff is a loyal, trustworthy friend to the end.\" Description According to AKC's published breed standard which was approved June 10, 1936, the \"American Staffordshire Terrier should give the impression of great strength for his size, a well put-together dog, muscular, but agile and graceful, keenly alive to his surroundings. He should be stocky, not long-legged or racy in outline. Watchman is a military mascot of the now disbanded Staffordshire Regiment and the now withdrawn 3rd Battalion (STAFFORDS) of the Mercian Regiment.  He is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: When was the airline alliance founded whose one of the member among 20 member carriers is Korean Air?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nSkyTeam is an airline alliance.  Founded in June 2000, SkyTeam was the last of the three major airline alliances to be formed, the first two being Star Alliance and Oneworld.  s of 2014 , SkyTeam consists of 20 carriers from five continents and operates with the slogan \"Caring more about you\".  It also operates a cargo alliance named SkyTeam Cargo, which partners ten carriers, all of them SkyTeam members.  Its centralised management team, \"SkyTeam Central\", is based at the World Trade Center Schiphol Airport on the grounds of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in Haarlemmermeer, Netherlands. SkyTeam is one of the world's three major airline alliances. Founded in June 2000, SkyTeam was the last of the three alliances to be formed, the first two being Star Alliance and Oneworld, respectively. Its annual passenger count is 437 million customers (2023), the second largest of the three major alliances. As of January 2024, SkyTeam consists of 19 active carriers from five continents and operates with the slogan \"Caring more about you\". It also operates a cargo alliance named SkyTeam Cargo, which partners ten carriers, all of them SkyTeam members. Its centralised management team, SkyTeam Central, is based in Amstelveen, Netherlands. As of 2023, SkyTeam flies to more than 1,050 destinations in more than 166 countries and operates more than 10,770 daily flights. The alliance and its members have 750 lounges worldwide.    Membership history     Formation and early years  On 22 June 2000, representatives of Delta Air Lines, Aeroméxico, Air France, and Korean Air held a meeting in New York to form a third airline alliance. These became the four founding carriers of SkyTeam. Upon its formation, SkyTeam would offer its customers a total of 6,402 daily flights to 451 destinations in 98 countries. In September 2000 (2000-09), the alliance established a cargo alliance, SkyTeam Cargo. The group's inaugural members were Aeromexpress, Air France Cargo, Delta Air Logistics and Korean Air Cargo. The following month, the newly established airline alliance announced its intentions to incorporate CSA Czech Airlines as the 5th member in April the following year. The alliance saw the joining of CSA Czech Airlines on 25 March 2001; Alitalia entered SkyTeam on 27 July the same year, with its membership scheduled to become effective 1 November that year. On 30 September 2001, the alliance received KLM's application for membership, following the airline's plans to create a leading airline group with Air France. In 2003, Delta's subsidiary, Delta Express, was replaced by Song. That same year, SkyTeam also launched an improved website focused on providing passengers with more information, increased interactivity and other resources.    2004: First major expansion   On 24 May 2004, Aeroflot signed a memorandum of understanding with SkyTeam as it intended to become a full member.

The nut rage incident, colloquially referred to as \"nutgate\", (Korean: 땅콩 회항, Ttangkong hoehang) was an air rage incident that occurred on December 5, 2014, at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City onboard Korean Air Flight 086. Korean Air vice president Heather Cho (Korean name: Cho Hyun-ah; later changed to Cho Seung-yeon), dissatisfied with the way a flight attendant served nuts on the plane, ordered the aircraft to return to the gate before takeoff.All first class passengers, including Cho, were given nuts bagged in their original packaging—in keeping with the airline's procedures; however, Cho had expected them to be served on a plate in first class. She questioned the cabin crew chief about the standard procedure of serving the nuts. After a heated confrontation, Cho assaulted him and ordered him off the plane, requiring a return to the gate and delaying the flight about 20 minutes.When the incident became public, Cho and Korean Air were heavily criticized, and in the aftermath, Cho resigned from one of her several executive positions at Korean Air. She was subsequently found guilty in a South Korean court of obstructing aviation safety and given a twelve-month prison sentence, of which she served five months. The flight attendant and cabin crew chief had returned to their positions by April 2016. Initial incident and official report On December 5, 2014, Heather Cho (Korean name: Cho Hyun-ah; Korean: 조현아), a businesswoman and daughter of the then Korean Air chairman and CEO, Cho Yang-ho, boarded Korean Air Flight 086 registered as HL7627 at John F. Kennedy International Airport, destined for Incheon International Airport in Seoul. Prior to takeoff, she was served macadamia nuts in a closed bag rather than on a plate.Upon being served the nuts in a bag, Cho rebuked flight attendant Kim Do-hee and called over cabin crew chief Park Chang-jin to complain because it was not served on a plate. It was alleged that, under Cho's orders, the chief was forced to kneel down before her and beg for forgiveness. Cho repeatedly struck Park's knuckles with the edge of a digital tablet, and summarily dismissed him. Cho ordered the chief to get off the plane, requiring it to taxi back to the airport's gate. Wings (for clarity the Wings Alliance) was the working name of a proposed airline alliance to be anchored by the American carriers Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines of USA with the European flag carriers KLM of the Netherlands and Italy's Alitalia.  Although these airlines cooperated with one another through code-sharing and frequent flyer program coordination, no formal association was ever announced.  It was rendered superfluous in September 2004 when most of its participants joined the SkyTeam alliance. A continent pass (usually called something like Europe (air)pass, Pacific (air)pass or American (air)pass) is a product and service of an airline alliance.  For a relatively low price the traveler can travel freely using all intra-continental flights the airline alliance offers on that continent.  There are restrictions on the number of miles, flights or stops the traveler can make.  Travelers can benefit from the extensive networks airline alliances offer and can earn reward points for each mile they fly by participating in the alliance's frequent flyer program. An airline alliance is an aviation industry arrangement between two or more airlines agreeing to cooperate on a substantial level. Alliances may provide marketing branding to facilitate travelers making inter-airline codeshare connections within countries. This branding may involve unified aircraft liveries of member aircraft.In 2015, Star Alliance was the largest with 23% of total scheduled traffic in Revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs)/revenue passenger miles (RPMs), followed by SkyTeam with 20.4% and Oneworld with 17.8%, leaving 38.8% for others.In 2019, by number of passengers, Star Alliance was leading 762 million, followed by SkyTeam (630 million) and Oneworld (535 million). Rationale Benefits can consist of an extended network, often realised through codeshare agreements. Many alliances started as only codeshare networks. Cost reductions come from sharing operation facilities (e.g. catering or computer systems), operation staff (e.g. ground handling personnel, at check-in and boarding desks), investments and purchases (e.g. in order to negotiate extra volume discounts). Traveller benefits can include lower prices due to lowered operational costs for a given route, different times to choose from, more destinations within easy reach, shorter travel times, more options of airport lounges shared with alliance members, fast track access on all alliance members if having frequent flyer status, faster mileage rewards by earning miles for a single account on several different carriers, round-the-world tickets, enabling travellers to fly over the world for a relatively low price.Airline alliances may also create disadvantages for the traveller, such as higher prices when competition is erased on a certain route or less frequent flights; for instance, if two airlines separately fly three and two times a day respectively on a shared route, their alliance might fly less than 5 (3+2) times a day on the same route. This might be especially true between hub cities for each airline. e.g., flights between Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (a Delta Air Lines fortress hub) and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (a KLM fortress hub). History The first airline alliance was formed in the 1930s, when Panair do Brasil and its parent company Pan American World Airways agreed to exchange routes to Latin America.

After several years of service and expansion, the airline was fully privatized in 1969. Value Alliance is an airline alliance formed in May 2016.  It is the world's second alliance (after the U-FLY Alliance) to consist only of low-cost carriers (LCCs).  However, it is the first pan-regional LCC alliance.  It comprises seven Asia-Pacific airlines: Cebu Pacific, Jeju Air, Nok Air, NokScoot, Scoot, Tigerair Australia and Vanilla Air, along with Tigerair who merged with Scoot under the Scoot brand.

It is the target for the \"New Horizons\" probe for a flyby on 1 January 2019, after its Pluto flyby.  It was selected as \"New Horizons\"' target in August 2015.  After four course changes in October and November 2015, \"New Horizons\" is on course toward 2014 MU . Spree is a candy manufactured by The Willy Wonka Candy Company, a brand owned by the Ferrara Candy Company unit of Ferrero SpA. Spree was created by the Sunline Candy Company, later renamed Sunmark Corporation, of St. Louis, Mo., in the mid-1960s. Spree was an idea of an employee named John Scout. In the 1970s the brand was bought by Nestlé, which markets the candy under the Willy Wonka brand.Spree is classified as a compressed dextrose candy, covered in a colored fruit-flavored shell. Depending on the market it is available in 141.7-gram (5.00 oz) rolls or thin 5-ounce (140 g) movie theater-size cardboard boxes. It is billed as \"a kick in the mouth\".A variety called Chewy Spree, which has a candy shell and a chewy center, comes in 12-ounce (340 g) pouches, rather than rolls.

Cathy Olkin is a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute, focusing on the outer solar system.  Olkin was a deputy project scientist on NASA's New Horizons team responsible for the July 2015 flyby of Pluto and became co-principal investigator for New Horizons' Ralph instrument, a color camera and near-infrared imaging spectrometer.  She is deputy principal investigator for NASA's Lucy mission examining the Trojan asteroids around Jupiter, to launch in 2021 and fly past its targets between 2025 and 2033.  Her scientific research has earned an h-index of 24.  She is also the author of the title story \"All These Wonders\" in \"The Moth\" radio show's 20th anniversary collection, \"The Moth Presents: All These Wonders.  True Stories About Facing the Unknown\"; reviewing the collection in \"The New York Times\", Michiko Kakutani described Olkin's contribution as \"a thrilling account...of last-minute emergency repairs made to the New Horizons spacecraft as it traveled three billion miles to get a close-up of Pluto.\" The geology of Pluto consists of the characteristics of the surface, crust, and interior of Pluto.  Because of Pluto's distance from Earth, in-depth study from Earth is difficult.  Because of this, many details about Pluto remained unknown until 14 July 2015, when \"New Horizons\" flew through the Pluto system and began transmitting data back to Earth.  When it did, Pluto was found to have remarkable geologic diversity, with \"New Horizons\" team member Jeff Moore saying that it \"is every bit as complex as that of Mars”.  The final \"New Horizons\" Pluto data transmission was received on October 25, 2016.

New Horizons 2 (also New Horizons II, NHII, or NH2) was a proposed mission to the trans-Neptunian objects by NASA.  It was conceived as a planetary flyby mission in 2002.  In March 2005, the proposal was not selected for further development because of a shortage of plutonium-238 needed for the radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG).  The New Horizons 2 study was funded out of the New Horizons program, and was delivered to the U.S. Congress in June 2005.

In March 2012, the company estimated a total yearly revenue of $26 million, despite losing money in its first half year. By 2017, the company had revenue of approximately $2 billion and 51% of online pet food sales in the US. At that time, CEO Ryan Cohen prepared to take Chewy public as both Petco and PetSmart approached with merger offers.  Petco's offer would be paid for in part using stock, whereas PetSmart offered an all-cash bid that would also allow Chewy to remain a completely separate business. In 2017, Chewy was purchased by PetSmart, a retail entity backed by private equity firm BC Partners, for $3.35 billion, which at the time was the largest ever acquisition of an e-commerce business. Following the acquisition, Cohen remained CEO and operated the business largely as an independent unit of PetSmart. Between 2017 and 2018, Chewy’s sales increased from $2.1 billion to $3.5 billion, with 66% of sales coming from customers signed up for automatic recurring shipments. Sumit Singh succeeded Ryan Cohen as CEO of Chewy in March 2018.    2019–present: Post-IPO  In 2019, Chewy filed an S-1 for an initial public offering, intending to trade under the ticker symbol CHWY. In its filing, Chewy reported a net loss of $268 million on total sales of $3.5 billion for its 2018 fiscal year. In the 2019 fiscal year, Chewy earned net sales of $4.85 billion, a 40 percent year-over-year increase on a 52-week basis. The company saw increased demand from millions of existing and new customers as the business sustained growth throughout the economic disruption of the COVID-19 era.

The Tenzing Montes ( ; formerly Norgay Montes or less officially, Norgay Mountains) are icy mountains, near the Hillary Montes, that reach 3.4 km above the surface of the dwarf planet Pluto, bordering the southwest region of Sputnik Planitia in the south of Tombaugh Regio (or the part of Tombaugh Regio south of the equator).  The mountains, first viewed by the \"New Horizons\" spacecraft on 14 July 2015, and announced by NASA on 15 July 2015, are named after the Nepalese mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, who, along with Sir Edmund Hillary, made the first successful ascent of the highest peak on Earth, Mount Everest (29 May 1953).  The mountains were informally called \"Norgay Montes\" by the New Horizons team, but that name was later changed from \"Norgay\" to \"Tenzing\".  On 7 September 2017, the name \"Tenzing Montes\" was officially approved together with the names of Tombaugh Regio and twelve other nearby surface features. Thomas Rowe Price Jr. (March 16, 1898 – October 20, 1983) was the founder of T. Rowe Price, an American publicly owned investment firm, established in 1937 and headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. The company offers mutual funds, subadvisory services, and separate account management for individuals, institutions, retirement plans, and financial intermediaries. Along with Philip Fisher, Price was an early proponent of the growth investing strategy. Early life Price was born on March 16, 1898, to Thomas Rowe Price Sr. and Ella Stewart Black, in Glyndon, Maryland, near Baltimore. His father was a graduate of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, as was his grandfather Benjamin F. Price. Thomas Sr. served as a surgeon for the Western Maryland Railroad for many decades as well as a local \"country doctor\" for Glyndon, and was the attending physician at the birth of his own children. Price's mother Ella was the daughter of Samuel Black, a prominent builder and contractor in Baltimore, and the aunt of S. Duncan Black, one of the two founders of the electric tool company Black and Decker based in Towson, Maryland.Price attended the Glyndon School in Glyndon, Maryland, as well as Franklin High School in what is now Reisterstown, Maryland, and, briefly, the Friends School of Baltimore. In 1919, he received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Swarthmore College, where he was a member of Delta Upsilon fraternity. In 1927, Price married Eleanor Baily Gherky, originally of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who was then attending Goucher College in Baltimore. Eleanor's father, William D. Gherky, was an inventor and engineer who had been a \"former research associate of Thomas Alva Edison\" and had helped to convert major American cities such as New York, Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Philadelphia, and Baltimore from gas and steam power to electricity. Together, they had two sons.With his degree in chemistry, Price initially sought a career with the chemical company DuPont. However, he soon realized that he was more interested in money management than scientific research, and left DuPont to join a series of small investment firms and brokerages. Career After a decade spent at three investment firms and brokerages, Price formed a particular vision for the operation of an investment firm that specifically combined a focus on growth investing with a no-load (commission) fee system for clients.

Rowe Price was named one of the best places to work in money management by Pensions&Investments and was one of Fortune's most admired companies in 2020.    Business philosophy  Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages, but disliked the operating models of sales-oriented firms at the time. When he founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in 1937, his firm diverged from the norm in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. He became well known as the \"father of growth investing\" and was nicknamed the \"Sage of Baltimore\" by Forbes.    History     1937–1986  Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co., along with Price. Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management, and private investment accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled during the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. T.

A sequel, also organised by Sherwood, was released the next year: \"Return to the Dark Side of the Moon\" was a tribute to Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth.  The far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria.  It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South Pole–Aitken basin.  Although both sides of the moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night, the far side is sometimes called the \"dark side of the Moon,\" with \"dark\" meaning \"unknown\" rather than lack of light. The lunar phase or phase of the moon is the shape of the illuminated (sunlit) portion of the Moon as seen by an observer on Earth.  The lunar phases change cyclically as the Moon orbits the Earth, according to the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth.  The Moon's rotation is tidally locked by the Earth's gravity, therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth.  This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit.  Therefore, the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100% (full moon) to 0% (new moon).  The lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres.  Each of the four \"intermediate\" lunar phases (see below) is roughly seven days (~7.4 days) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon's orbit.  Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as Shoemaker, all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight, followed by 14.77 days of \"night\".  (The side of the Moon facing away from the Earth is sometimes called the \"dark side of the Moon\", although that is a misnomer.) During the early stages of the Iraq War, members of the United States Army and the Central Intelligence Agency committed a series of human rights violations and war crimes against detainees in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. These abuses included physical abuse, sexual humiliation, physical and psychological torture, and rape, as well as the killing of Manadel al-Jamadi and the desecration of his body. The abuses came to public attention with the publication of photographs by CBS News in April 2004, causing shock and outrage and receiving widespread condemnation within the United States and internationally.  The International Committee of the Red Cross reported that most detainees were civilians with no links to armed groups.The George W. Bush administration stated that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were isolated incidents and not indicative of U.S. policy.: 328  This was disputed by humanitarian organizations including the Red Cross, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, which stated that the abuses were part of a wider pattern of torture and brutal treatment at American overseas detention centers, including those in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and at Guantanamo Bay (GTMO).: 328  There were also 36 prisoners killed at Abu Ghraib due to insurgent mortar attacks, which provoked further criticism due to the facility's location in a combat zone.Documents known as the Torture Memos came to light a few years later. These documents, prepared in the months leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States Department of Justice, authorized certain \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" (generally considered to involve torture) of foreign detainees. The memoranda also argued that international humanitarian laws, such as the Geneva Conventions, did not apply to American interrogators overseas. Several subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, including Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), overturned Bush administration policy, ruling that the Geneva Conventions do apply.In response to the events at Abu Ghraib, the United States Department of Defense removed 17 soldiers and officers from duty. Eleven soldiers were charged with dereliction of duty, maltreatment, aggravated assault and battery. Between May 2004 and April 2006, these soldiers were court-martialed, convicted, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service. Two soldiers, found to have perpetrated many of the worst offenses at the prison, Specialist Charles Graner and PFC Lynndie England, were subject to more severe charges and received harsher sentences.

Between his terms as secretary of defense, he served as the CEO and chairman of several companies. Born in Illinois, Rumsfeld attended Princeton University, graduating in 1954 with a degree in political science. After serving in the Navy for three years, he mounted a campaign for Congress in Illinois's 13th Congressional District, winning in 1962 at the age of 30. Rumsfeld accepted an appointment by President Richard Nixon to head the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969; appointed counsellor by Nixon and entitled to Cabinet-level status, he also headed up the Economic Stabilization Program before being appointed ambassador to NATO. Called back to Washington in August 1974, Rumsfeld was appointed chief of staff by President Ford. Rumsfeld recruited a young one-time staffer of his, Dick Cheney, to succeed him when Ford nominated him to be secretary of defense in 1975. When Ford lost the 1976 election, Rumsfeld returned to private business and financial life, and was named president and CEO of the pharmaceutical corporation G. D. Searle & Company. He was later named CEO of General Instrument from 1990 to 1993 and chairman of Gilead Sciences from 1997 to 2001. Rumsfeld was appointed secretary of defense for a second time in January 2001 by President George W. Bush. As secretary of defense, Rumsfeld played a central role in the 2001 United States invasion of Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq. Before and during the Iraq War, he claimed that Iraq had an active weapons of mass destruction program; no stockpiles were ever found. Donald Henry Rumsfeld (July 9, 1932 – June 29, 2021) was an American politician, government official and businessman who served as secretary of defense from 1975 to 1977 under president Gerald Ford, and again from 2001 to 2006 under President George W.

Additionally, Rumsfeld was a four-term U.S. Congressman from Illinois (1963–1969), director of the Office of Economic Opportunity (1969–1970), counselor to the president (1969–1973), the U.S. Representative to NATO (1973–1974), and the White House Chief of Staff (1974–1975). Between his terms as secretary of defense, he served as the CEO and chairman of several companies. Born in Illinois, Rumsfeld attended Princeton University, graduating in 1954 with a degree in political science. After serving in the Navy for three years, he mounted a campaign for Congress in Illinois's 13th Congressional District, winning in 1962 at the age of 30. Rumsfeld accepted an appointment by President Richard Nixon to head the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969; appointed counsellor by Nixon and entitled to Cabinet-level status, he also headed up the Economic Stabilization Program before being appointed ambassador to NATO. Called back to Washington in August 1974, Rumsfeld was appointed chief of staff by President Ford. Rumsfeld recruited a young one-time staffer of his, Dick Cheney, to succeed him when Ford nominated him to be secretary of defense in 1975. The Dark Side of the Rainbow – also known as Dark Side of Oz or The Wizard of Floyd – is the pairing of the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon with the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. This produces numerous moments of apparent synchronicity where the film and the album appear to correspond. Members of Pink Floyd and the Dark Side of the Moon engineer Alan Parsons denied any intent to connect the album to the film. History In August 1995, the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette published an article by Charles Savage suggesting that readers watch the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz while listening to the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon. Savage said the idea was first shared on an online Pink Floyd newsgroup. According to Savage, if you start the album as the MGM lion roars onscreen, “The result is astonishing. It's as if the movie were one long art-film music video for the album. Song lyrics and titles match the action and plot. The music swells and falls with character's movements ... expect to see enough firm coincidences to make you wonder whether the whole thing was planned.\" In his 1995 article, Savage favoured starting at the lion's first roar, but he acknowledged in 2023 that the third roar had by then become the usual start point. Commonly noted instances of synchronicity include Clare Torry's howls on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" during the film's tornado scene, and the album's final fading heartbeat while Dorothy listens to the Tin Woodman's non-existent heart. Fans created websites about the experience and catalogued moments of synchronicity. In April 1997, the DJ George Taylor Morris discussed \"Dark Side of the Rainbow\" on Boston radio. In July 2000, Turner Classic Movies aired The Wizard of Oz with the option of synchronising the broadcast to the album using the SAP audio channel. Numerous venues have staged Dark Side of the Rainbow shows, where the film is projected while either a recording of the album is played or else a jam band or Pink Floyd tribute act covers it live; for example moe.'s 2000 New Year's Eve show at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. Response Members of Pink Floyd have denied any connection between the album and the film. The guitarist, David Gilmour, dismissed it as the product of \"some guy with too much time on his hands\". The Unknown Known (also known as The Unknown Known: The Life and Times of Donald Rumsfeld) is a 2013 American documentary film about the political career of former U.S. Secretary of Defense and congressman Donald Rumsfeld, directed by Academy Award winning documentarian and filmmaker Errol Morris. It is a summary of 33 hours of interviews that Morris conducted with Rumsfeld over eleven separate sessions during visits to Newton, Massachusetts. The film was released on April 4, 2014, by Radius-TWC, and is dedicated to the memory of Roger Ebert. Synopsis The major portion of the film is spent addressing excerpts from the countless memos, nicknamed \"Yellow Perils\" by his first Pentagon staff and \"Snowflakes\" by his second, that Rumsfeld wrote during his time as a congressman and advisor to four different presidents, twice as United States Secretary of Defense. It also focuses on a response Rumsfeld gave to a question at a U.S. Department of Defense news briefing on February 12, 2002, about the lack of evidence linking the government of Iraq with the supply of weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups. The content of the memos are varied, covering everything from the aftermath of Watergate, to the torture and abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, to the definition of the word \"terrorism\". Morris returns to the motif of snowflakes swirling within a globe throughout the documentary as he discusses the memos with Rumsfeld, the contents of which the Defense Secretary allowed him limited access to while preparing the film, and several of which Rumsfeld reads aloud on camera.At the beginning of the film, Rumsfeld argues that a major purpose of the Department of Defense is to evaluate \"unknown knowns\", or \"the things you think you know, that it turns out you did not\", to anticipate hostile actions before they take place. Illustrating his point, Rumsfeld suggests that the failure of the United States to anticipate the attack on Pearl Harbor was a failure of imagination. As the interviews proceed, several times Morris attempts to point out things that Rumsfeld says which he thinks contradict either fact or Rumsfeld's own past statements, but, as noted in several reviews of the film, Rumsfeld does not always directly acknowledge what Morris is referring to or engage in deeper discourse, and at times he deflects the points raised. The Dark Side of the Moon Tour was a concert tour by British rock band Pink Floyd in 1972 and 1973 in support of their album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\".  There were two separate legs promoting \"Dark Side of the Moon\", one in 1972 before the album's release and another in 1973 after its release. The Dark Side is the third studio album by power metal band DarkSun, which is the English version of \"El Lado Oscuro\", the album was released in September 2007.  \"The Dark Side\" and was released in September 2007 through FC Metal Recordings.  The critics were as good as the Spanish version, like \"the album can be defined with one word: brilliant!\" .  The band collaborated on Rage's album \"Speak of the Dead\", with a Spanish version of the song \"Full Moon\" entitled \"La Luna Reine,\" which appeared as a bonus track.  Just after the release of \"The Dark Side\" drummer Rafael Yugueros left DarkSun to form part of power metal band WarCry replacing former drummer Alberto Ardines.  Yugueros had already worked with WarCry on their 1997's demo \"Demon 97\".  The band re-recruited Daniel Cabal who worked on what would become the band's new album \"Libera Me\".  On the summer of 2008 DarkSun announced that Cabalwas leaving the band, all these occurred in a professional and friendly way from both parties.  On the same announcement the band presented new drummer Jose Ojeda, who had performed drums on Spanish bands like Rivendel Lords, Killian, among others. From the Dark Side of the Moon is a 2011 album released by singer/songwriter Mary Fahl.  The album is a song-by-song \"re-imagining\" of Pink Floyd's classic 1973 album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". Dark Side of the Moon is a French mockumentary by director William Karel which originally aired on Arte in 2002 with the title Opération Lune.  The basic premise for the film is the theory that the television footage from the Apollo 11 Moon landing was faked and recorded in a studio by the CIA with help from director Stanley Kubrick.  It features some surprising guest appearances, most notably by Donald Rumsfeld, Dr. Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, Vernon Walters, Buzz Aldrin and Stanley Kubrick's widow, Christiane Kubrick.   The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records in the UK and Capitol Records in the US. Developed during live performances before recording began, it was conceived as a concept album that would focus on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and also deal with the mental health problems of the former band member Syd Barrett, who had departed the group in 1968. New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London.The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised the band's earlier work. The group employed multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers, including experimentation with the EMS VCS 3 and a Synthi A. The engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many of the sonic aspects of the recording, and for the recruitment of the session singer Clare Torry, who appears on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".The Dark Side of the Moon explores themes such as conflict, greed, time, death, and mental illness. Snippets from interviews with the band's road crew and others are featured alongside philosophical quotations. The sleeve, which depicts a prismatic  spectrum, was designed by Storm Thorgerson in response to the keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design which would represent the band's lighting and the album's themes. The album was promoted with two singles: \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\".The Dark Side of the Moon is among the most critically acclaimed albums and often features in professional listings of the greatest of all time. It brought Pink Floyd international fame, wealth and plaudits to all four band members. A blockbuster release of the album era, it also propelled record sales throughout the music industry during the 1970s. The Dark Side of the Moon is certified 14x platinum in the United Kingdom, and topped the US Billboard Top LPs & Tape chart, where it has charted for 990 weeks. By 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon had sold over 45 million copies worldwide, making it the band's best-selling release, the best-selling album of the 1970s, and the fourth-best-selling album in history. Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by English rock band Pink Floyd.  It was released on 12 September 1975 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and a day later by Columbia Records in the United States.  Inspired by material the group composed while performing around Europe, \"Wish You Were Here\" was recorded during numerous recording sessions at Abbey Road Studios in London, England.  Two of the album's four songs criticise the music business, another expresses alienation and the multi-part track \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" is a tribute to Syd Barrett.  Barrett's mental breakdown had forced him to leave the group seven years earlier, prior to the release of the group's second studio album \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" (on which he only appeared on three tracks).  It was lead writer Roger Waters' idea to split \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" into two parts that would bookend the album around three new compositions and to introduce a concept linking them all.  The band had used a linking concept for their previous album, \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", to great success.  As with \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", the band used studio effects and synthesizers and brought in guest singers to supply vocals on some tracks of the album.  These singers were Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on \"Have a Cigar\", and the Blackberries, who added backing vocals to \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\".

Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical is a rock musical with a book and lyrics by James Rado and Gerome Ragni and music by Galt MacDermot.

The musical broke new ground in musical theatre by defining the genre of \"rock musical\", using a racially integrated cast, and inviting the audience onstage for a \"Be-In\" finale.

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Christoph Sanders played the role of Kyle Anderson in a tv series that aired on what network?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nGhost Whisperer is an American supernatural television series, which ran on CBS from September 23, 2005, to May 21, 2010.The series follows the life of Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt), who has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts. While trying to live as normal a life as possible—she is married and owns an antique store—Melinda helps earthbound spirits resolve their problems and cross over into the light, or the spirit world. Her tasks are difficult and at times she struggles with people who push her away and do not believe in her gift. In addition, the ghosts are mysterious and sometimes menacing at first, and Melinda must use the clues available to her to understand the spirits' needs and help them. The show was created by John Gray and was produced by Sander/Moses Productions, executive producer, and Jennifer Love Hewitt in association with ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.On May 18, 2010, CBS canceled the series after five seasons. Premise Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is a young woman from the town of Grandview, New York, who has the ability to see and communicate with the dead. Melinda lives with her husband, Jim Clancy (David Conrad), and later their son Aiden (Connor Gibbs). She owns a shop called \"Same as It Never Was Antiques\". Each ghost seeks Melinda's help in relaying a message or completing a task that will put their spirit to rest, and allow them to cross over into the light. Those who died with unfinished business become earthbound and cannot cross over, and Melinda, as their earthly representative, helps them to find peace. The show does not present the ghosts as having sinned; rather it is the spirits' own guilt that condemns them, and their own fear of judgment that keeps them from \"crossing over\" into an afterlife.The series also starred Aisha Tyler as Andrea Marino, Melinda's best friend, who runs the antique shop with her. Andrea is killed in the finale of season 1 when she was driving to her brother's apartment located in the city. During the premiere of season 2, Melinda meets Delia Banks (Camryn Manheim), a struggling real estate agent who forms a friendship with Melinda and who eventually agrees to run the antique shop with her.

A leading pioneer and a skilled lawyer, Sanders played a prominent role in the development of Montana Territory and the state's early political history. Christopher \"Christoph\" Sanders (born April 21, 1988) is an American actor who is best known for his role as Ned Banks in the television series \"Ghost Whisperer\" and Kyle Anderson in the television series \"Last Man Standing\". Christopher \"Christoph\" Sanders (born April 21, 1988) is an American actor who is best known for his role as Ned Banks in the television series Ghost Whisperer and Kyle Anderson in the sitcom Last Man Standing on ABC (2011-2017) and FOX (2018-2021).    Early life  Sanders was born in Arden, North Carolina and grew up in nearby Hendersonville, North Carolina. He was home-schooled and participated in such extra curricular activities as soccer and the Boy Scouts of America. He went on to attain scouting's highest rank of Eagle Scout. Concerning the difference Scouting made in his life, Sanders says, \"when you spend that much time working on something, it becomes a part of you. Being an Eagle Scout affects your outlook on your fellow man.\" While growing up, he considered engineering as a possible career. He took drafting classes at Blue Ridge Community College for two years and had been accepted at UNC Wilmington, but decided that acting was what he wanted to do instead.    Career    Sanders first became interested in acting at the age of 9 when he began taking classes at the Flat Rock Playhouse, the state theater of North Carolina. He began with basic drama classes before moving on to an intermediate level and finally being invited to join their YouTheater company and gaining membership in its elite conservatory. He graduated from the conservatory program at the age of 18. While there he appeared in more than 16 productions including A Christmas Carol; The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; and Bye, Bye Birdie. He got his first agent when he was 12 and at the age of 16 did a series of television commercials in Georgia for General Mills. He made his film debut in 2006 with a small role in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby which was filmed primarily in and around Charlotte, North Carolina. A role soon followed that in the somewhat controversial movie Hounddog which was shot on a plantation near Wilmington, North Carolina. Much of the film's controversy stemmed from a pivotal scene in which a young girl, played by then 12-year-old actress Dakota Fanning, was raped by Sanders' character. It was a role he found to be challenging but one that gave him a chance to prove the range of his acting ability. When asked about the controversial scene, Sanders responded, \"That's just one part of the film.

It was released on February 7, 2006 and a portion of the proceeds were donated to the National Breast Cancer Foundation.  A story regarding the album's creation by characters Peyton Sawyer and Ellie Harp to raise funds for breast cancer research featured as a plot element on the third season of the show.  Several of the artists appearing on the album also appeared on the show, including Gavin DeGraw, Fall Out Boy, Audioslave, Tyler Hilton as well as leukemia survivor Andrew McMahon and his band, Jack's Mannequin.  Bethany Joy Lenz who portrays Haley James Scott in the series also sang a song on the show that appeared on this album.  The album debuted and peaked at No. 54 on the \"Billboard 200\" and No. 3 on the \"Billboard Top Soundtracks\" chart. \" Allmusic\" gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, concluding the compilation was an \"eclectic set that improves on the original album.\" Yattalunga is a northern suburb of Adelaide, South Australia.  It is the easterm in the City of Playford.  Yattalunga is east of One Tree Hill, between the Gawler–One Tree Hill Road and the South Para River.  The road runs near the top of the ridge separating the South Para River gorge from the Adelaide Plains. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge is a pair of twin suspension bridges that span the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound in Pierce County, Washington. The bridges connect the city of Tacoma with the Kitsap Peninsula and carry State Route 16 (known as Primary State Highway 14 until 1964) over the strait. Historically, the name \"Tacoma Narrows Bridge\" has applied to the original bridge, nicknamed \"Galloping Gertie\", which opened in July 1940 but collapsed possibly because of aeroelastic flutter four months later, as well as to the successor of that bridge, which opened in 1950 and still stands today as the westbound lanes of the present-day two-bridge complex.The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened on July 1, 1940. The original bridge received its nickname \"Galloping Gertie\" for the vertical movement of the deck observed by construction workers during windy conditions. While engineers and engineering professor F. B. Farquharson were hired to seek ways to stop the odd movements, months' experiments were unsuccessful. The bridge became known for its pitching deck, and collapsed into Puget Sound the morning of November 7, 1940, under high wind conditions. Engineering issues, as well as the United States' involvement in World War II, postponed plans to replace the bridge for several years; the new bridge was opened on October 14, 1950.By 1990, population growth and development on the Kitsap Peninsula had caused traffic on the bridge to exceed its design capacity; as a result, in 1998 Washington voters approved a measure to support building a parallel bridge. After a series of protests and court battles, construction began in 2002 and the new bridge opened to carry eastbound traffic on July 16, 2007, while the 1950 bridge was reconfigured to carry westbound traffic.At the time of their construction, both the 1940 and 1950 bridges were the third-longest suspension bridges in the world in terms of main span length, behind the Golden Gate Bridge and George Washington Bridge. The 1950 and 2007 bridges are as of 2017 the fifth-longest suspension bridge spans in the United States and the 43rd-longest in the world.Tolls were charged on the bridge for the entire four-month service life of the original span, as well as the first 15 years of the 1950 bridge. The Narrows is an American 2008 independent film starring Kevin Zegers, Sophia Bush, Vincent D'Onofrio, Eddie Cahill and Monica Keena. Plot  The movie is based on Tim McLoughlin's novel Heart of the Old Country, which has Mike Manadoro (Kevin Zegers) as a 19-year-old Brooklyn boy who is torn between two worlds. When Mike's photography portfolio wins him a partial scholarship to New York University, he must figure out how to balance his tight-knit Italian neighborhood roots in Bay Ridge with the opportunity to blend into the expansive, sophisticated world on the other side of the East River. Since his job at a local car service doesn't earn him enough to make up for the rest of the tuition, and his father, a retired sanitation worker on disability, refuses out of pride to support Mike's attempts for financial aid, Mike ultimately takes a job making deliveries for Tony, the local mob boss, to make up the difference. Mike not only has to balance work with his academic assignments, he has to manage his personal relationships as well. This includes his attraction to a beautiful, cool, intellectual young woman, Kathy Popovich (Sophia Bush) he meets at NYU, with his responsibility to his longtime girlfriend Gina (Monica Keena) from the neighborhood whom he's promised to marry. The stakes grow higher as he faces consequential choices from turning his back on all he knows and pursuing a new life.

Murray has written a graphic novel with lead illustrator Danijel Žeželj titled Everlast (2011), and a novel co-authored with Heather Graham titled American Drifter (2017). Early life Chad Michael Murray was born in Buffalo, New York, and was raised by a single father, Rex Murray, who worked as an air traffic controller. His mother left the family when Murray was 10 years old. He has five siblings, consisting of an older sister, three younger full brothers, and a younger half-brother from his father's second marriage, and has two step-siblings, consisting of a step-sister and a step-brother. Murray is of Scottish, Irish, English, German, Swiss-German and Polish descent.Murray attended Clarence High School in Clarence, New York. He became a fan of literature and played football. As a teenager, he worked at the Dipson Theatres in Eastern Hills Mall. In his late teens, he broke his nose. This led to reports during his career that he had received a nose job. Murray clarified in a 2004 interview, \"I got jumped in a Burger King when I was 18 and had my nose put on the other side of my face. It was three guys [...] The doctors didn't even bother running X-rays. They just reset it. The 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the first bridge at this location, was a suspension bridge in the U.S. state of Washington that spanned the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula. It opened to traffic on July 1, 1940, and dramatically collapsed into Puget Sound on November 7 of the same year. The bridge's collapse has been described as \"spectacular\" and in subsequent decades \"has attracted the attention of engineers, physicists, and mathematicians\". Throughout its short existence, it was the world's third-longest suspension bridge by main span, behind the Golden Gate Bridge and the George Washington Bridge.Construction began in September 1938. From the time the deck was built, it began to move vertically in windy conditions, so construction workers nicknamed the bridge Galloping Gertie. The motion continued after the bridge opened to the public, despite several damping measures. The bridge's main span finally collapsed in 40-mile-per-hour (64 km/h) winds on the morning of November 7, 1940, as the deck oscillated in an alternating twisting motion that gradually increased in amplitude until the deck tore apart. The violent swaying and eventual collapse resulted in the death of a cocker spaniel named \"Tubby\", as well as inflicting injuries on people fleeing the disintegrating bridge or attempting to rescue the stranded dog.Efforts to replace the bridge were delayed by World War II, but in 1950, a new Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened in the same location, using the original bridge's tower pedestals and cable anchorages. The portion of the bridge that fell into the water now serves as an artificial reef.The bridge's collapse had a lasting effect on science and engineering. In many physics textbooks, the event is presented as an example of elementary forced mechanical resonance, but it was more complicated in reality; the bridge collapsed because moderate winds produced aeroelastic flutter that was self-exciting and unbounded: for any constant sustained wind speed above about 35 mph (56 km/h), the amplitude of the (torsional) flutter oscillation would continuously increase, with a negative damping factor, i.e., a reinforcing effect, opposite to damping. Millicent \"Millie\" McFadden (\"née\" Huxtable) is a fictional character on the CW television series \"One Tree Hill\", portrayed by Lisa Goldstein.  Originally from New York City, Millie was introduced as the personal assistant to Brooke Davis, founder of Clothes Over Bros.

Her third album, produced by Ron Aniello, never came to life due to changes behind the label Epic Records.  She then teamed up with her friend Amber Sweeney to create the duet Everly in 2008.  After three albums and four years of collaboration, the band split.  Soon after that, Lenz released her fourth solo album produced once again by her friend Ron Aniello, and sold during the \"Rock the Schools\" Concert.  A year later Jeff Cohen produced her fifth solo album which was sold to attendees of the One Tree Hill Convention \"From Wilmington to Paris\" and later 500 autographed first edition copies of the CD were sold on Etsy.  In 2015, she released a sneak peek EP of an upcoming album through Kickstarter but the hard copies promised to the backers were sent 2 years later, and the full album never came to life due to legal proceedings with the creator of the project.  She then teamed up with artists Daniel Shyman & Doo Crowder to release two songs for Christmas 2015.  And they went on tour during summer 2016 under the name of \"Joy Lenz and the Fire pit Band\".\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: The New York City Airport that is associated with Shuttle America is located on which New York bays?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nEastern Air Lines Shuttle (or Eastern Air Shuttle) was the brand name of Eastern's air shuttle.  It began operations on April 30, 1961 and was sold in 1989 to Donald Trump, and later became the Trump Shuttle.  In April 1992, the shuttle service began as the USAir Shuttle (presently American Airlines Shuttle).  The shuttle originally flew between New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C. and Newark.  The shuttle's slogan was \"Imagine life without us.\" Trump Shuttle, Inc. was an airline owned by Donald Trump from 1989 to 1992.  The landing rights and some of the physical assets necessary to operate the shuttle flights were originally part of Eastern Air Lines and known as the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle.  It operated hourly flights on Boeing 727 aircraft from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C., then known as Washington National Airport, as well as charter service to other destinations.  Its IATA designator code was TB (later reassigned to Jetairfly). The South Brooklyn Railway (reporting mark SBK) is a railroad in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.  It is owned by the City of New York and operated by the New York City Transit Authority.  Its original main line ran parallel to 38th Street from the Upper New York Bay to McDonald Avenue, and south on McDonald Avenue to the Coney Island Yards, mostly underneath the former Culver Shuttle and the IND Culver Line of the New York City Subway. The James Speyer House was a mansion located at 1058 Fifth Avenue, on the southeast corner of 87th Street, in the Upper East Side of New York City.  It was constructed for James Speyer, a New York City banker.  It was a reticent classicizing block of three storeys and a set-back attic storey over a sunk basement lit by a light well; it had five bays on the avenue, where the upper two floors were linked by a colossal order of pilasters, and seven bays on the side street. The Marine Air Terminal (also known as Terminal A) is an airport terminal located at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, New York City. Its main building, designed in the Art Deco style by William Delano of the firm Delano & Aldrich, opened in 1940. The terminal was built to handle Pan Am's fleet of flying boats, the Boeing 314 Clippers, which landed on the nearby Bowery Bay. Technological advances after World War II made the Clippers obsolete, and the Marine Air Terminal was renovated in 1946 to serve conventional planes. As of April 2024, the terminal is used by Spirit Airlines for flights to various destinations around the U.S.The Marine Air Terminal was LaGuardia Airport's original terminal for overseas flights. It was highly popular in the 1940s, when LaGuardia was the only major airport in the U.S. which offered regular flights to Europe. Traffic dropped drastically after the larger Idlewild Airport opened in 1948, and Clippers stopped serving the terminal in 1952. The terminal then served as the airport's general aviation terminal for more than three decades, except for a short period in the 1950s, when it was used by Northeast Airlines. The Pan Am Shuttle service started operating from Marine Air Terminal in 1986. Delta Air Lines took over the service in 1991, operating Delta Shuttle flights from the terminal until 2017, after which it was used by various carriers. The terminal has been renovated multiple times throughout its history.The main terminal building consists of a two-story circular core with a projecting entrance pavilion and a pair of two-story wings. The brick facade is painted buff, with black details, and contains a frieze that depicts flying fish. The three-story rectangular entrance pavilion contains a canopy and a set of doors leading to the terminal's main rotunda. The rotunda contains marble floors and walls, as well as the Flight mural by James Brooks. Both the interior and the exterior of the main building were declared New York City Landmarks in 1980, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In addition, there was a hangar for seaplanes next to the main building, which has been converted into a garage for snow-removal vehicles. History Following Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight in 1927, commercial air travel in the United States increased during the 1930s. Shuttle America Corporation was an American regional airline based in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.  It fed United Airlines flights at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) and Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) under the United Express brand, as well as Delta Air Lines flights at Atlanta (ATL), New York-LaGuardia (LGA), and New York-JFK under the Delta Connection brand.  Shuttle America also operated two of three Delta Shuttle East Coast routes, serving Washington, D.C. and Chicago from New York-LaGuardia. Shuttle America Corporation was a regional airline in the United States based in Indianapolis, Indiana,. It fed United Airlines flights at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) and Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) under the United Express brand, as well as Delta Air Lines flights at Atlanta (ATL), New York-LaGuardia (LGA), and New York-JFK under the Delta Connection brand.  Shuttle America also operated two of three Delta Shuttle East Coast routes, serving Washington, D.C., and Chicago from New York-LaGuardia. Shuttle America merged into Republic Airways on January 31, 2017.    History   Shuttle America was established in 1995 by former CEO David Hackett, and began operations on November 12, 1998, as a low-fare commuter airline, headquartered in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, the location of Hartford's Bradley International Airport.   Shuttle America's first route was Hartford, Connecticut, to Buffalo, New York. Shuttle America got much publicity for their launch because of their \"super-low $29 fares\". Shuttle America's first aircraft; registered N801SA, was a 50-seat Bombardier Dash 8-300 with leather seats and a very creative and patriotic paint scheme. Shuttle America had rapid growth in its first year, adding more aircraft and destinations. In 1999, Shuttle America made a controversial move to reach the Boston market. Instead of choosing the busy Logan Airport in East Boston, Shuttle America chose a nearby regional airport, Hanscom Field. Located in Bedford, Massachusetts, just 12 miles (19 km) west of Boston, it had amenities not found at the larger Logan Airport. With free parking, rental cars, and convenience to the I-95 highway, it was promoted as \"Hassle-free Hanscom Field\". From Hanscom, Shuttle America served Buffalo, LaGuardia Airport in New York, Trenton, New Jersey, and Greensboro, North Carolina, via Trenton.  At that time Trenton, New Jersey, was acting as a hub because of its central location in their route network. At the peak time of their operation without codeshares, the airline was flying six Dash 8-300 aircraft and transported over 3000 passengers per day.  Additional destinations in their route network during this time period include Albany, New York, Islip, New York, Norfolk, Virginia,  and Wilmington, Delaware.

LaGuardia Airport (IATA: LGA, ICAO: KLGA, FAA LID: LGA) is an airport in the northern part of the New York City borough of Queens in the United States.  It is on the waterfront of Flushing and Bowery Bays in East Elmhurst and borders the neighborhoods of Astoria and Jackson Heights.  The airport is the third busiest airport serving New York City, and the twentieth busiest in the United States.  LaGuardia Airport covers 680 acre . LaGuardia Airport (IATA: LGA, ICAO: KLGA, FAA LID: LGA)  is a civil airport in East Elmhurst, Queens, New York City. Covering 680 acres (280 ha) as of July 1, 2024, the facility was established in 1929 and began operating as a public airport in 1939. It is named after former New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia. The airport primarily accommodates airline service to domestic and limited international destinations. As of 2023, it was the third-busiest airport in the New York metropolitan area behind Kennedy and Newark airports, and the 19th-busiest in the United States by passenger volume. The airport is located directly to the north of the Grand Central Parkway, the airport's primary access highway. While the airport is a hub for both American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, commercial service is strictly governed by unique regulations including a curfew, a slot system, and a \"perimeter rule\" prohibiting most non-stop flights to or from destinations greater than 1,500 mi (2,400 km). Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, LaGuardia was criticized for its outdated facilities, inefficient air operations, and poor customer service metrics. In response, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) in 2015 announced a multibillion-dollar reconstruction of the airport's passenger infrastructure, which is expected to be completed by 2025.    History     Original site   Prior to human development, the coastlines of Bowery Bay and Flushing Bay converged at a natural point that comprised the eventual northern shoreline of Newtown, Queens. By 1858 the area was partially contained by the estate of Benjamin Pike Jr. based around what is today known as the Steinway Mansion, which was soon purchased and consolidated with other property by William Steinway. In June 1886, Steinway opened a summer resort development known as Bowery Bay Beach on the peninsula. Originally featuring a bathing pavilion, beach, lawns, and boathouse, the resort was renamed North Beach and later expanded with the addition of Gala Amusement Park. By the turn of the century, North Beach's German-influenced development drew comparisons to Brooklyn's Coney Island. Its fortunes would soon turn, however, as Prohibition in the United States and war-related anti-German sentiment presented significant challenges to the resort's profitability.

John F. Kennedy International Airport (IATA: JFK, ICAO: KJFK, FAA LID: JFK) , often referred to as Kennedy Airport, or simply JFK, is the primary international airport serving New York City.  It is the busiest international air passenger gateway into North America, the fifth busiest airport in the United States and the busiest airport in the New York City airport system, handling just under 59 million passengers in 2016.  Over ninety airlines operate out of the airport, with non-stop or direct flights to destinations in all six inhabited continents. The transportation system of New York City is a network of complex infrastructural systems.  New York City, being the most populous city in the United States, has a transportation system which includes one of the largest subway systems in the world; the world's first mechanically ventilated vehicular tunnel; and an aerial tramway.  New York City's airport system, which includes John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport (located in New Jersey), Stewart Airport and a few smaller facilities, is one of the largest in the world.  New York City is also home to an extensive bus system in each of the five boroughs, and numerous taxis throughout the city. The LaGuardia Airport subway extension is a proposed extension of the New York City Subway's BMT Astoria Line (currently served by the N and ​W trains) to connect to LaGuardia Airport, which has never had an airport rail link. Such a connection was first proposed in 1943, when LaGuardia was already surrounded by development. Two proposals during the 1990s and 2000s received funding, In 1990, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) proposed a $1.6 billion, dedicated airport rail link from Midtown Manhattan to LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports, which would be developed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). The PANYNJ set aside $40 million for engineering and marketing before the line was canceled in 1995; part of the route became the AirTrain JFK people mover system. The MTA, PANYNJ, and federal, state, and local officials began considering another proposal in 1998, which would have entailed extending the Astoria Line. The plan received funding for construction in the early 2000s, but the plan was ultimately shelved in 2003 after opponents rejected the idea of constructing the extension through a residential area of Astoria.In 2015, the planned AirTrain LaGuardia reflected a similar idea, although various media outlets criticized it as inferior due to its distance from the city, calling it a pet project of then-governor Andrew Cuomo. The AirTrain's future was placed in doubt after Cuomo's resignation in 2021, putting discussion of the subway extension back on the table, and the PANYNJ suggested the extension in a 2022 report. Despite this, the AirTrain was canceled in March 2023 and replaced with enhanced Q70 bus service, continuing to leave the airport without a rail link. Context LaGuardia Airport, in the New York City borough of Queens, is considered the only major U.S. airport that is not served by train as of 2022. The nearest New York City Subway station to the airport is 3 miles (4.8 km) away. The M60 bus, which runs to Upper Manhattan, is the only public transportation route between Manhattan (the most densely populated New York City borough) and the airport. Pelham Picture House, also known as \"The Picture House\" , is a historic movie theater located at Pelham, Westchester County, New York.  The rectangular building was built in 1921, in the Spanish Revival style and is oriented at an angle at the northwest corner of Wolf's Lane and Brookside Avenue.  It features angled end bays, a distinctive round arched entrance, tiled hoods over the large windows on the end bays, and a wood open truss ceiling in the auditorium.  The building typifies early 20th century commercial architecture of New York City commuter suburbs with its eclectic style reflective of the Mission style. The 42nd Street Shuttle is a New York City Subway shuttle train service that operates in Manhattan.  The shuttle is sometimes referred to as the Grand Central/Times Square Shuttle, since these are the only two stations served by the shuttle.  It runs at all times except late nights, connecting Times Square to Grand Central under 42nd Street.  It is the shortest regular service in the system, running about 2700 ft in 90 seconds. Space Shuttle America (also known as Space Shuttle America – The Next Century) was a motion simulator ride at the Six Flags Great America theme park in Gurnee, Illinois, that opened in 1994. The ride's main feature was a full-scale replica of an American Space Shuttle orbiter. It closed permanently after the 2007 season and was removed on December 5, 2009. Storyline The storyline of the ride was that riders have boarded a new Space Shuttle called America, which is capable of transporting passengers to the fictional Armstrong City using the LRVM (Lunar Run Velocity Management) Warp. Armstrong City is located a short distance from Tranquility Base, the site of the first crewed Moon landing.Guests entered a building that has a small replica of Launch Control at Cape Canaveral. Several TV screens display fake NASA TV recordings about the shuttle and security cam views of the fictional facility that attendees are supposedly touring. Shortly before boarding, there is a notice about a large meteor that is approaching Earth.In the movie, the shuttle takes off horizontally and the Pas-Com (Passenger Compartment) rises out of the cargo bay so riders can do some orbital sightseeing. The shuttle passes Space Shuttle Destiny, which is doing some cleanup work around the atmosphere. Next the shuttle passes an HBO satellite and Space Station Freedom. The shuttle enters LRVM warp and exits a short distance from the Moon. The shuttle then flies over the Sea of Tranquility and Armstrong City. Shortly before landing at Armstrong, an alert is sent to the shuttle crew ordering them to investigate a meteor danger in the area. The shuttle, not even getting a chance to land, takes off again towards an asteroid belt. America is then hit by an asteroid and is now fighting to survive in the asteroid field. America begins blasting asteroids with its 'particle beam' (laser). The shuttle then spots the meteor and is alerted it is heading on a direct course to Earth. Unable to destroy it from a distance, the shuttle flies through a canyon and a cave and destroys it from the inside. The shuttle, now crippled, heads immediately back towards the LRVM and warps back to Earth.  As the shuttle prepares for re-entry, the hydraulics for the Pas-Com malfunction, preventing it from being retracted, but the fault is corrected just in time. The shuttle lands and the ride ends. The original meaning of the word shuttle is the device used in weaving to carry the weft. By reference to the continual to-and-fro motion associated with that, the term was then applied in transportation and then in other spheres.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Fear the Voices was co-written by the bassist for the group he was a part of until which month?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nAndrew Shives was the former bassist of the industrial metal group Fear Factory between 1992 and 1993.  His photo appeared on the Soul of a New Machine album jacket, but he didn't play on the album (Dino Cazares played all bass tracks).  In 1993 Fear Factory released a 7\" single under their Spanish name Factoría De Miedo called Sangre De Niños.  This is the only material that was ever recorded in a studio with Andrew Shives on bass.  He was forced to leave the band due to some internal disputes and was replaced by Christian Olde Wolbers.  He then played for Cool for August for some years, and is now in a band called Paperstreet which is based in Atlanta, Georgia. \"Fear the Voices\" is the last single that Alice in Chains released with vocalist Layne Staley and the only single that was co-written by bassist Mike Starr.  The song was included on the box set \"Music Bank\" (1999). == Origin and recording ==\n\"Fear the Voices\" is an outtake from the Dirt album, recorded in 1992.

Originally formed as a joke band called \"Tony Flow And The Miraculously Majestic Masters Of Mayhem\" by bassist Flea, guitarist, Hillel Slovak and drummer, Jack Irons, all friends from high school.  They asked fellow high school friend, Anthony Kiedis to join them onstage for their first-ever show at the Hollywood, California venue known as The Rhythm Lounge.  Kiedis had previously been a MC to introduce his friend's former bands.  However, this time Kiedis was asked to sing.  With one song, a made-up rap Kiedis created called \"Out In L.A.\", the band took to the stage as an opening act for Neighbor's Voices.  The club owner was so impressed by their performance he told them to return the following week with another song.  The band quickly wrote \"Get Up and Jump\" and played it at that second show.  In early March 1983 the band made the name change to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  The band first made a name for themselves on their local club scene when they played the famous Kit Kat Club by doing their now famous socks on cocks routine (this would become a trademark for the band and something they would do on occasion for many years).  After this performance, Lindy Goetz decided to be their manager, a role he would hold until 1999.  The 1983 tour consisted of shows mostly in the band's homestate of California except for one show in Nevada.  A 10-song demo tape was recorded with Spit Stix, drummer for the punk band Fear, which Flea was briefly with.

Michael Christopher Starr (April 4, 1966 – March 8, 2011) was an American musician best known as the original bassist in Alice in Chains, which he played with from the band's formation in 1987 until January 1993. Michael Christopher Starr (April 4, 1966 – March 8, 2011) was an American musician best known as the original bassist for the rock band Alice in Chains, with which he played from the band's formation in 1987 until January 1993. He was also a member of Sato, Gypsy Rose, Sun Red Sun, and Days of the New. Starr had a long history of substance abuse, including addictions to both heroin and synthetic opioids. In 2011, he died of a prescription drug overdose at the age of 44.    Career  In 1983, Starr formed the heavy metal band Sato. Their song \"Leather Warrior\" appeared on Northwest Metalfest, a compilation album featuring various metal acts released in 1984 by Seattle label Ground Zero Records. Starr briefly joined another band, Gypsy Rose, which included early Alice N' Chains producer Tim Branom on lead vocals and his future bandmate Jerry Cantrell on guitar. Starr and Cantrell left Gypsy Rose and started working in other bands. Cantrell wanted to form a new band and his roommate, Layne Staley, gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could talk to him. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank rehearsal studios and listened to Cantrell's demos. Cantrell mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in the band Gypsy Rose in Burien. Kinney pointed at his girlfriend and said: \"that's weird cause that's his sister\". Kinney called Starr and a few days later he jammed with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank. However, the band did not have a singer. The trio then began staging what Cantrell and Kinney later said were fake auditions in order to coax Staley into joining their band. Eventually, Staley quit the other bands he was performing with at that time and joined their band on a full-time basis. This band gained attention in the Seattle area playing under several different monikers before they eventually settled on the name Alice in Chains, which they had taken from Staley's previous band Alice N' Chains.

Their song \"Leather Warrior\" appeared on Northwest Metalfest, a compilation album featuring various metal acts released in 1984 by Seattle label Ground Zero Records. Starr briefly joined another band, Gypsy Rose, which included early Alice N' Chains producer Tim Branom on lead vocals and his future bandmate Jerry Cantrell on guitar. Starr and Cantrell left Gypsy Rose and started working in other bands. Cantrell wanted to form a new band and his roommate, Layne Staley, gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, the girlfriend of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could talk to him. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank rehearsal studios and listened to Cantrell's demos. Cantrell mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in the band Gypsy Rose in Burien. Kinney pointed at his girlfriend and said: \"that's weird cause that's his sister\". Kinney called Starr and a few days later he jammed with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank. However, the band did not have a singer. The trio then began staging what Cantrell and Kinney later said were fake auditions in order to coax Staley into joining their band. Eventually, Staley quit the other bands he was performing with at that time and joined their band on a full-time basis.

Fear the Walking Dead: Flight 462 is a 16-part web series based on the television series \"Fear the Walking Dead\".  The series premiered on October 4, 2015, on AMC's official website.  It also aired as promos during \"The Walking Dead\" season 6.  The web series tells the story of a group of passengers aboard a commercial airplane during the earliest moments of the outbreak.

Two of its characters, Alex and Jake, are introduced in \"Fear the Walking Dead\" season 2, episode 3 \"Ouroboros\". Phonophobia, also called ligyrophobia or sonophobia, is a fear of or aversion to loud sounds (for example firecrackers)—a type of specific phobia. It is a very rare phobia which is often the symptom of hyperacusis.  Sonophobia can refer to the hypersensitivity of a patient to sound and can be part of the diagnosis of a migraine.Occasionally it is called acousticophobia.The term phonophobia comes from Greek φωνή - phōnē, \"voice\" or \"sound\" and φόβος - phobos, \"fear\".Ligyrophobics may be fearful of devices that can suddenly emit loud sounds, such as computer speakers or fire alarms. When operating a device such as a home theater system, computer, television, or CD player, they may wish to have the volume turned down all the way before doing anything that would cause the speakers to emit sound, so that once the command to produce sound is given, the user can raise the volume of the speakers to a comfortable listening level. They may avoid parades and carnivals due to the loud instruments such as drums. As festive occasions are accompanied by music of over 120 decibels, many phobics develop agoraphobia. Other ligyrophobics also steer clear of any events in which firecrackers are to be let off.Another example is watching someone blow up a balloon beyond its normal capacity. This is often an unsettling, even disturbing thing for a person with ligyrophobia to observe, as they anticipate a loud sound when the balloon pops. When balloons pop, two types of reactions are heavy breathing and panic attacks. The sufferer becomes anxious to get away from the source of the loud sound and may get headaches. It may also be related to, caused by, or confused with hyperacusis, extreme sensitivity to loud sounds. Phonophobia also has been proposed to refer to an extreme form of misophonia. See also Astraphobia – fear of thunderMisophonia – irrational 'hatred' or disgust expressed towards specific soundsGlobophobia - the fear of balloons, which is commonly linked to phonophobiaList of phobias References  External links Lucius Hunt is an alternative Australian progressive rock band formed in late 2005.

It is the first track of the group's second album T.N.T., released only in Australia and New Zealand on 8 December 1975, and was written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott. The song  combines bagpipes with hard rock instrumentation; in the middle section of the song there is a call and response between the bagpipes and guitar. The original recording is in B-flat major, but it was played live in A major.Record World said that it shows \"a firm grasp on rock dynamics\" and sounds \"like a cross between the Stones and the Easybeats.\"The song is also the first track on the internationally released High Voltage (April 1976).The full version of the song is also on the Volts CD of the Bonfire box set, released in 1997.This was a signature song for Bon Scott.

However, the band accepts these hardships as natural on the path to stardom, saying that \"It's a long way to the top/If you wanna rock 'n' roll\".The title and chorus line is said to have originated with a Melbourne club manager who would warn the young bands he booked that it would be \"a long bloody way to the top\" if they wanted to make it in the business. Bagpipes While jamming on new songs in the studio, co-producer George Young (the older brother of Angus and Malcolm) recalled that Bon Scott had once been in a pipe band and encouraged the band to experiment with incorporating bagpipes into the song. Scott left the studio that day and returned with a set of bagpipes purchased at a Park Street music store at what was an extortionately high price (AU$479) at the time.

Nok Hockey is a tabletop game produced by the Carrom Company since 1942.  It has its roots in the ancient game of carrom, but combines the basic \"strike and pocket\" gameplay with a hockey theme. Ludo , (from Latin \"ludo\", \"I play\") is a strategy board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single die.  Like other cross and circle games, Ludo is derived from the Indian game Pachisi, but simpler.  The game and its variations are popular in many countries and under various names.   Pichenotte is a French Canadian tabletop game, with a board, game pieces and rules similar to carrom.  Used more broadly, the term is a general name for tabletop games played with small (usually wooden) pieces that are flicked using the thumb and index (or middle) finger, including such games as carrom, sharing a similarity in that their mechanics lie somewhere between pocket billiards and shuffleboard.  The term is sometimes also mistakenly used as the actual name of other games of this class, such as carrom and crokinole.  Commercially produced boards are available, some under the trade name Pinnochi.  The game is sometimes referred to as \"piche\" or \"pish\".

The carrom ball is a style of spin bowling delivery used in cricket. The ball is released by flicking it between the thumb and a bent middle finger in order to impart spin. Origin and history The first bowler known to have used this style of delivery was the Australian Jack Iverson from Victoria, who used it throughout his Test cricket career in the period after the Second World War, although he did not use the name \"carrom ball\". Fellow Australian John Gleeson used a similar grip a decade later, but by the end of the 1970s the method was almost forgotten. It has since re-entered cricketing consciousness because of its use by Ajantha Mendis of Sri Lanka, with the new name of carrom ball. Mendis unveiled this delivery during the 2008 Asia Cup. Sri Lankan Rangana Herath is believed to be the first left handed spin bowler to have used the method in international cricket, dismissing Australian opener David Warner with a delivery in the carrom ball style during a test match. Method The ball is held between the thumb, forefinger and the middle finger and, instead of a conventional release, the ball is squeezed out and flicked by the fingers like a carrom player flicking the disc on a carrom board. It is different from wrist-bowled deliveries. Traditional leg-spin is bowled with anti-clockwise wrist movement for a right-armed bowler. A finger-bowled delivery such as traditional off-spin is bowled with a clockwise finger movement. In a carrom delivery, the middle finger and thumb flick or squeeze the ball out of the hand, like a carrom player flicking a striker in the indoor game of carrom. When the centre finger is gripped towards the leg side, the ball spins from leg to off; when the centre finger is gripped towards the off side, the ball spins from off to leg. Depending on the degree the ball is gripped towards the leg side, the carrom ball could also travel straight. The carrom ball can therefore spin to either the off or leg sides or travel straight (as opposed to the misconception that it only spins towards the off side).

Here, the players can choose to play with their Facebook friends on the online mode, and can play with up to 6 players in the local multiplayer mode. Development of Ludo King Before Ludo King, Gametion primarily focused on developing browser games for desktop users. In 2013, the company shifted focus to mobile gaming. It published several games, including Snakes and Ladders and Baby’s Big Adventure, but these were all average. Henry L. Haskell started the Ludington Novelty company in 1889, making baskets and games.  The names of the first games of \"Novelty\" are unknown.  Haskell was a Sunday school teacher at the time and was concerned that young boys were loitering around pool halls, exposing them to develop bad habits.  In 1892, he invented a game called \"carroms\" that the whole family could play on a carrom board, a design he later patented.  A 1953 Ludington Daily News article talks of an 1895 newspaper advertisement that said, \"you can keep the boys home nights by giving them a good carrom game.\" Trouble (known as Frustration in the UK and Kimble in Finland) is a board game in which players compete to be the first to send four pieces all the way around a board.  Pieces are moved according to the roll of a die.  \"Trouble\" was developed by the Kohner Brothers and initially manufactured by Irwin Toy Ltd., later by Milton Bradley (now part of Hasbro).  The game was launched in the United States in 1965.  It is very similar to the much older game, \"Mensch ärgere dich nicht\", as well as another Hasbro game, \"Sorry!\"  (originally marketed by Parker Brothers).  The classic version is now marketed by Winning Moves.  All these games are versions of the classic Indian game Pachisi, which was first introduced to the western world in England under the name of \"Ludo\". Ludo (; from Latin  ludo '[I] play') is a strategy board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls of a single die. Like other cross and circle games, Ludo is derived from Bharat, the Indian game Pachisi. The game and its variations are popular in many countries and under various names.  History Pachisi was created in Bharat (India) in the sixth century CE. It was modified to use a cubic die with a die cup and patented as \"Ludo\" in England in 1896.  The Royal Navy took Ludo and converted it into the board game Uckers. Ludo board Special areas of the Ludo board are typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is assigned a colour and has four tokens in their colour. The board is normally square with a cross-shaped playspace, with each arm of the cross having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player's home column. A sixth coloured square not on the home column is a player's starting square. At the centre of the board is a large finishing square, often composed of coloured triangles atop the players' home columns (thus depicting \"arrows\" pointing to the finish). Rules Rule No. 1: The game starts with each player choosing a set of four pieces (usually colored red, blue, green, and yellow) and placing them on the starting square.Rule No. 2: The objective of the game is to move all four pieces around the board and return them to the starting square before your opponents.Rule No. 3: On each turn, players roll two dice to determine how many spaces they can move their pieces.Rule No. 4: The number on each die represents how many spaces a piece can move. For example, if a player rolls a 3 and a 6, they can move one piece 3 spaces and another piece 6 spaces.Rule No. 5: Pieces can only move forward, never backward.Rule No. 6: If a piece lands on a square occupied by an opponent's piece, it can \"knock off\" that piece and send it back to the starting square.Rule No.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

        "query": "Given the following question and contexts, create a final answer to the question. \n=========\nQUESTION: Are both the Swedish Vallhund and the Šarplaninac associated with the care of livestock?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nOriginated in 1969 by staff nurses at the University of Minnesota, Primary Nursing is a system of nursing care delivery which emphasizes continuity of care and responsibility acceptance by having one registered nurse (RN), often teamed with a licensed practical nurse (LPN) and/or nursing assistant (NA), who together provide complete care for a group of patients throughout their stay in a hospital unit or department.  For the duration of a patient’s episode of care, the primary nurse accepts responsibility for administering some and coordinating all aspects of the patient’s nursing care.  When RNs supervise LPNs and NAs in the care of patients, costs associated with labor and other resources typically decrease while more attentive, well-coordinated care is provided for patients, increasing patient satisfaction and safety. The Šarplaninac or Yugoslavian Shepherd Dog is a dog breed of the livestock guardian type named after the Šar Mountains.  It is a molosser-type mountain dog. The Šarplaninac or Sharr dog is a breed of dog of livestock guardian type. It is named for the Šar Mountains or Šar Planina range in the Balkans, where it is principally found. It was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as the Illyrian Shepherd Dog or Ilirski Ovčar from 1939 until 1957, when the name was changed to Yugoslavian Shepherd Dog – Sharplanina or Jugoslovenski Ovčarski Pas – Šarplaninac. In Ottoman times, the dogs moved with the flocks of sheep, spending the summer in the area of the Šar Mountains and the winter in Thessaly, where they were known as Greek Shepherd Dogs.: 124     History   The origins of the Šarplaninac are not known. It was traditionally used to guard cattle or sheep.: 124  In the transhumant system of management, livestock was moved twice a year, to the high mountain pastures for the summer, and to the warmer plains for the winter. In the southern Balkans, very large numbers of sheep were moved in this way, accompanied by men and dogs.: 35  In Ottoman times, dogs of this type moved with the flocks of sheep, spending the summer in the area of the Šar Mountains and the winter in Thessaly – where they were known as 'Greek Shepherd Dogs'.: 124  In 1939 it was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as a Yugoslav breed with the name 'Ilirski Ovčar' or 'Illyrian Shepherd Dog'; In 1957, following a request from the Yugoslav Federation of Cynology (Jugoslovenski Kinološki Savez), the Fédération Cynologique Internationale agreed to change the official international names of the breed to 'Jugoslovenski Ovcarski Pas – Sarplaninac' and 'Yugoslavian Shepherd Dog – Sharplanina'.

In 1968 the Kraški Ovčar or Karst Shepherd Dog, which had previously been considered a sub-type, was recognised as a separate breed. Breed numbers were much reduced by the conflicts associated with the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.: 299  Following these events, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale recognised North Macedonia and Serbia as the countries of origin. The Šarplaninac is found mainly in the Šar Mountains, where it is thought to have originated and from which the name 'Šarplaninac' derives.: 124 : 25  It is also distributed in the areas of the Jablanica, Korab and Pelister mountains.: 358     Characteristics  The Šarplaninac is a large and strongly built dog. The body is slightly longer than the height at the withers, and the front legs account for approximately 55% of the height. The head is large but proportional to the body, with dark eyes. It is a robust, well-proportioned dog with plenty of bone, of a size that is well above the average and with a thick, long, rather coarse coat that emphasises the short-coupled appearance. A sheep dog or sheepdog is generally a dog or breed of dogs historically used in connection with the raising of sheep. The Welsh Corgi ( , Welsh for \"dwarf dog\"; plural \"corgis\" or occasionally the etymologically consistent \"corgwn\" ( )) is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales.  Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi.  Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund.  A certain degree of interbreeding between the two types has been suggested to explain the similarities between the two. The Welsh Corgi ( or Corgi, plural Corgis, or occasionally the etymologically consistent Corgwn; ) is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name corgi is derived from the Welsh words cor and ci (which is mutated to gi), meaning \"dwarf\" and \"dog\", respectively.Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Physical differences are seen between the two breeds. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger, both in weight and height. Their tails are of different shapes, and docking was previously performed on Corgis before the practice was largely banned.Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 14th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund.The Pembroke is the more popular of the two, yet still appears on the Kennel Club's vulnerable dog breeds of the United Kingdom list. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi gained in popularity because Elizabeth II had personally owned more than 30 Pembrokes or Corgi-Dachshund crosses, known as dorgis. History Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are adjoining historical agricultural counties in South West Wales. Welsh Corgis were cattle herding dogs, the type of herding dog referred to as \"heelers\", meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move. The combination of their low height off the ground and the innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle. The term \"Corgi\" means either cur dog or dwarf dog (cor  dwarf, gi  lenitive of ci, dog) in the Welsh language, which was not intended as an insult to the dog's size, rather as a purely descriptive term. Different tales have been told of the Corgi's origin; some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from shared ancestry, while others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories on the origin of the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation model (PCBH) is a psychological approach to population-based clinical health care that is simultaneously co-located, collaborative, and integrated within the primary care clinic.  The goal of PCBH is to improve and promote overall health within the general population.  This approach is important because approximately half of all patients in primary care present with psychiatric comorbidities, and 60% of psychiatric illness is treated in primary care.  Primary Care practice has traditionally adopted a generalist approach whereby physicians are trained in the medical model and solutions to problems typically involve medications, procedures, and advice.  Appointment times are short, with the goal of seeing a large number of patients in a day.  Many patients present with mental health care needs whose symptomology may overlap with medical disorders and which may exacerbate, complicate, or masquerade as physical symptoms.  In addition, many medical problems present with associated psychological sequelae (e.g. stress, emotional reactions, dysfunctional lifestyle behaviors), that are amenable to change, through behavioral intervention, that can improve outcomes for these health problems.  Over 50% of medical visits to primary care clinics today are related to chronic medical conditions (e.g. chronic pain, diabetes, COPD, hypertension, obesity).  As we learn more and more about the contributing factors to the development and maintenance of these medical problems, there is growing evidence that the PCBH model affords us the opportunity for early identification and behavioral/medical intervention that can prevent some acute problems from becoming chronic health care problems.  Behavioral Health Consultants (BHCs) work side-by-side with all members of the clinical care team (including primary care providers (PCPs) and nursing staff) to enhance preventive and clinical care for mental health problems that have traditionally been treated solely by physicians.  The role of the BHC is to facilitate systemic change within primary care that facilitates a multidisciplinary approach both from a treatment and reimbursement standpoint.  BHCs typically collaborate with physicians to develop treatment plans, monitor patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients’ changing needs In this review the terms Primary Care Behavioral Health Consultation and Behavioral Health Consultation will be used interchangeably. The Swedish National Board of Institutional Care (Swedish: \"Statens institutionsstyrelse\" , abbreviated SiS) is a Swedish government agency organized under the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.  The agency arrange compulsory care for young people with psychosocial problems and for adults suffering from substance abuse problems.  SiS offers a number of different treatment plans and mandatory care, when voluntary intervention have failed, and the right to forcibly detain and isolate individuals has become necessary.  Decisions regarding compulsory care is made by the administrative court, on the application of social services. A sheep dog or sheepdog is generally a dog or breed of dogs historically used in connection with the raising of sheep. The Tornjak (pronounced [torɲâk]), also known as the Bosnian-Herzegovinian sheepdog, is a recreated breed of livestock guardian dog native to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.  They are molosser-type mountain dogs, similar to other livestock guardian breeds of the region, the Šarplaninac, Bucovina Shepherd Dog, and the Greek Shepherd. History The earliest written reference to the breed dates back to the 11th century. Descriptions of the Tornjak are present in the writings of Peter Horvat, Bishop of Đakovo, in 1374, and Peter Lukić, Canon of the Đakovo diocese, in 1752. The dogs are described as guarding dogs, intelligent and bred to limit aggression. They were the transhumance shepherd dog of Vlachs in medieval Bosnia. Prevalence of the Tornjak gradually declined with the end of nomadic sheep herding in the region. In the early 1970s, a group of cynologists began a project to identify and breed dogs sharing similar characteristics to those found in historic writings about the breed. Pure blood breeding began in 1978 and the foundation stock of the modern breed is genetically homogeneous landrace shepherding dogs identified through this process. Tornjaks were first imported to the UK in 2013 with intentions of working towards UK Kennel Club Recognition. Name Numerous names are used to describe dogs from this region sharing similar characteristics and fulfilling a similar role. The FCI standard name, Tornjak, is derived from the word tor, meaning sheep pen. The breed is called Toraši in Sinj and the Kamešnica mountain, and the shepherds of the Dinara mountains call the breed Dinarci. Bosanski Ovčar Tornjak, meaning Bosnian Shepherd Dog and Hrvatski pas planinac, meaning Croatian mountain dog, are also used. Characteristics  Appearance The Tornjaks are large dogs, with somewhat square-bodied features and relatively agile movements. Despite this, their bones are not lightweight. The Tornjak is a long-coated breed with short hair over the face and legs. The hair is distinctively long and abundant over the neck (mane), and on the back of the upper thighs (breeches). The concept of an animal unit (AU) has traditionally been used in North America to facilitate planning, analysis and administration of forage use by grazing livestock, but the term has also had other applications (in relation to odor control regulation, feedlot size, manure management, etc.).  The term has been variously defined by regulation in different jurisdictions, and by livestock management specialists, rangeland resource managers and others.  Consequently, when using or interpreting the term, care is needed to ensure that a definition appropriate for the purpose is being used.  Most (but not all) definitions are based on the concept that a 1000-pound (454 kg) cow, with or without an unweaned calf, is one animal unit, with such a cow being assumed to consume 26 pounds (about 12 kg) of forage dry matter per day.

The Swedish Vallhund, also known as the \"Västgötaspets\" and Swedish cow dog, is a breed of dog native to Sweden.  The breed's name, \"Vallhund\", when translated into English, means herding dog, as the Swedish Vallhund was originally bred as a drover and herder of cows over 1,000 years ago.  In 1942, the dog came close to extinction, but careful breeding and publicity by Swedish national Bjorn von Rosen and K. G. Zettersten managed to revive the breed in popularity and save it from its likely end.  In 1943, the Swedish Kennel Club recognized the Swedish Vallhund as a breed, and officially categorized the Swedish Vallhund as \"the Västgötaspets\" for Västergötland, the province in which their revival took place.  Since then, the breed has been recognized by, and bred in, over ten countries and has gained some popularity.

Since then, the breed has been recognized by, and bred in, over ten countries and has gained some popularity.     Physical features  The average height of the Swedish Vallhund, measured at the withers, is approximately 33 cm (12.9 in) for males and 31 cm (12.2 in) for females. They are strong, with a long body. The ratio of height to body length is about 2:3. The head of the Vallhund is wedge-shaped, with dark brown oval eyes and pricked ears. They are born with every variance of tail length, from no tail at all to full length, therefore they are often mistaken for having been docked. (Tail docking is illegal in Sweden.)    Colour and coat  The coat is short and harsh, with a tight topcoat and a soft, dense undercoat. The hair on the foreparts of the legs is slightly longer than that of the neck, chest and back parts of the hind legs. Fur color varies from grey, greyish brown and greyish yellow to reddish brown, with darker hair on the back, neck, and sides of the body. Lighter hair in the same shade of color as mentioned above can be seen on the muzzle, throat, chest, belly, buttocks, feet and hocks. They have lighter markings on their shoulders, also known as harness markings. Some dogs have white patches which appear, to a small extent, as a narrow blaze, neckstop or slight necklace, as well as having white markings on their fore and hindlegs and on the chest.

The Maremma Sheepdog, in Italian Cane da pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese, is a breed of livestock guardian dog indigenous to central Italy, particularly to Abruzzo and the Maremma region of Tuscany and Lazio.  It has been used for centuries by Italian shepherds to guard sheep from wolves.  The literal English translation of the name is \"The dog of the shepherds of the Maremma and Abruzzese region\".  The English name of the breed derives from that of the Maremma marshlands, where until recently shepherds, dogs and hundreds of thousands of sheep over-wintered, and where the breed is today abundant although sheep-farming has decreased substantially.  The breed is widely employed in Abruzzo, where sheep herding remains vital to the rural economy and the wolf remains an active and protected predator.  Similar breeds include the Pyrenean Mountain Dog, the Kuvasz of Hungary, the Tatra of Poland, the Cuvac of Slovakia and the Šarplaninac (although not white), with all of which it may share a common ancestor; and the Akbash Dog of Turkey. Pastoralism is the branch of agriculture concerned with the raising of livestock.  It is animal husbandry: the care, tending and use of animals such as camels, goats, cattle, yaks, llamas, and sheep.  \"Pastoralism\" generally has a mobile aspect; moving the herds in search of fresh pasture and water (in contrast to pastoral farming, in which non-nomadic farmers grow crops and improve pastures for their livestock).  Pastoralism is similar to nomadic movement because all of them go to places season to season.  It is like they migrate from place to place like animals.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Intelligence squadrons  References  See also List of United States Air Force squadrons The United States Air Force's 102d Intelligence Wing (102 IW), of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, is a military intelligence unit located at Otis Air National Guard Base, Massachusetts.  Its primary subordinate operational unit is the 101st Intelligence Squadron.  According to the Air Force, the history of the 102d begins with the 318th Fighter Group, which was active during World War II.  After the war, the 318th was inactivated, and eventually the 102d Fighter Wing was formed, which had a direct lineage link.  In 1946, the 102d was activated at Logan International Airport where it stayed until 1968, when it moved to Otis Air Force Base.  Beginning in 1946, the wing began regular patrols of the Northeastern United States which took place in conjunction with Air Force active duty units.  In 1968, the 102d was moved to Otis, where it continued its regular patrols until 1973. The United States Air Force's 234th Intelligence Squadron is an Air National Guard intelligence unit located at Beale Air Force Base, California. Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod is a United States Coast Guard air station located on Joint Base Cape Cod formerly known as Otis Air National Guard Base in Sandwich, Massachusetts.  It operates from New York City to the Canada–US border.  It was founded in 1970 as a replacement to Coast Guard Air Station Salem. The Joint Base Cape Cod is a joint base created by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the United States War Department in 1935.  Governor James Curley signed the state bill to allocate and purchase land for a military facility, and establishing a formal commission to manage this new state military property and personnel.  After 22000 acre of land was secured in Cape Cod, the Massachusetts National Guard began erecting tents and a basic training program in the following year.  Formerly the Massachusetts Military Reservation, it was renamed in 2013 to Joint Base Cape Cod. The United States Air Force's 101st Intelligence Squadron (101 IS), Massachusetts Air National Guard, is an intelligence unit assigned to the 102nd Intelligence Wing and located at Otis Air National Guard Base, Massachusetts.  From its creation in 1921 to its mission change in 2008, the 101st was the mainstay of aerospace defence for the Northeastern United States.  The 101st was deployed during the Berlin Crisis to France and was also deployed to Panama during Operation Coronet Nighthawk.  It also participated in Operation Northern Watch.  During the September 11 attacks, the 101st was the first Air Force unit to send aircraft toward New York City, but they arrived too late to help stop the attacks.

During the September 11 attacks, the 101st was the first Air Force unit to send aircraft toward New York City, but they arrived too late to help stop the attacks. Base downsizing through the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process removed the wing's F-15C Eagles beginning in 2007, leaving the 101st with an intelligence gathering mission that will be fully active starting in 2010. It is one of three Air National Guard wings that works with the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency.    History     World War I  The squadron has its origins at Kelly Field, Texas, being organized as the 101st Aero Squadron on 22 August 1918.  The personnel were composed of new recruits from various Recruit Barracks, including Fort McDowell, Vancouver Barracks, Fort Sam Houston, Columbus Barracks, Fort Williams, Fort Warren and Fort Oglethorpe. During September 1917, it was found necessary to transfer many of its men.  Altogether, 113 men were transferred out and 32 transferred in, leaving the squadron well below its authorized strength.  In October, the squadron was again filled up to a required total of 150 recruits. After basic indoctrination into the military, on 29 October, the squadron was ordered to overseas service, being ordered to report to the Aviation Concentration Center, Garden City, Long Island. Arrived at Camp Mills on 3 November.  A wave of measles and mumps plagued the squadron, and it was placed in the Quarantine barracks for several weeks. It received orders to report to the Port of Entry, Philadelphia for immediate transport to France in mid-December 1917, sailing on the SS Northland on 4 December.

Finch became the Senior Leader of the US Air National Guard; (Chief of the Air Division National Guard Bureau) (1948-1950) In June 1953 it was reported that Gen. Mark W. Clark would retire and be replaced by Maj. Gen George G. Finch on the UN command delegation to the Korean armistice talks George G. Finch, born April 11, 1902 in Dade City, Florida, is considered one of the pioneers in United States aviation history.  He began his military career during World War 1, enlisting in the Aviation Section of the Army's Signal Corps in 1918.  He remained in the Reserve Corps after the war, and in 1926, became Commander, 27th Pursuit Squadron, 1st Pursuit Group.  In 1940, Georgia Governor Ed Rivers commissioned him to form the first flying unit of the Georgia Air National Guard.  The unit was mobilized into the U.S. Army in September, 1941, with Major Finch as commander.  After World War II, he was a leading critic of efforts to eliminate the air arm of the National Guard during peacetime.  General Finch gained the respect and admiration of Air National Guardsmen throughout the nation with his steadfast support and successful efforts to preserve the Air Guard.  He became the first Chief of the Air Force Division of the National Guard Bureau in 1948.  Under his leadership, the Air National Guard built to combat readiness and was among the first components called into service after the outbreak of the Korean War.  As a result of General Finch's vision and perseverance, 45,000 highly trained officers and airmen of 22 wings and 65 squadrons gave the Air Force the strength it needed in the early, critical phases of the Communist drive down the Korean peninsula.General Finch served as the senior Air Force member of the United Nations negotiating team at the peace talks at Panmunjom, Korea, and received the Legion of Merit for outstanding service in 1955; General Finch assumed command of Fourteenth Air Force, Robins AFB, Georgia, becoming the nation's first Air National Guardsman to head a numbered air force.  General Finch had a career of \"firsts\" including the US Army's first night landing with a single, five-million-candlepower floodlight in 1927.  He also established and endowed the General John P. McConnell Award at the United States Air Force Academy.  Considered by many as the father of the strong, independent Air National Guard existing today, General Finch retired in 1957.  No man has had greater impact on the Air Force Reserve and National Guard than has General George G. Finch.A graduate of the University of Georgia and a member of the Georgia Bar, General Finch was enshrined in the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame May 18, 1996. The Massachusetts Air National Guard (MA ANG) is the aerial militia of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States of America. It is a reserve of the United States Air Force and along with the Massachusetts Army National Guard, an element of the Massachusetts National Guard of the larger United States National Guard Bureau.As commonwealth militia units, the units in the Massachusetts Air National Guard are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. They are under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Massachusetts through the office of the Massachusetts Adjutant General unless they are federalized when ordered by the President of the United States. The Massachusetts Air National Guard is headquartered on Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, and its commander is Brigadier General Virginia I. Gaglio. Overview Under the \"Total Force\" concept, Massachusetts Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). Massachusetts ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Massachusetts Air National Guard Airmen are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window.Along with their federal reserve obligations, as commonwealth militia units the elements of the Massachusetts ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base is an Ohio Air National Guard installation at Rickenbacker International Airport near Lockbourne in southern Franklin County.  The base was named for the famous early aviator and Columbus native Eddie Rickenbacker. It is the home of the 121st Air Refueling Wing (121 ARW), an Air National Guard (ANG) unit that serves as the host wing and operates in federal service under the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command (AMC).Rickenbacker ANGB operates at the airport as a tenant of the Columbus Regional Airport Authority, sharing the facility with commercial airlines and other civilian aircraft operators. The air base is a joint military facility whose own tenant activities include the Ohio Army National Guard's Army Aviation Support Facility #2, Navy Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve units, and associated facilities.During World War II, the installation was a U.S. Army Air Forces training base known as Lockbourne Army Airfield, becoming an Air Force base in 1948 a few months following the establishment of the United States Air Force as an independent branch of the U.S. armed forces.  The base was named Lockbourne AFB from 1948 to 1974 and later Rickenbacker AFB from 1974 to 1980.  The facility was transferred from Strategic Air Command and the active duty Air Force on 1 April 1980 and turned over to the Air National Guard.

Twenty-Fifth Air Force (25 AF), also known as Air Force Intelligence is a numbered air force (NAF) within the United States Air Force (USAF), and serves as the Air Force's premier military intelligence organization.  25 AF was established on 29 September 2014 by redesignating the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency (a field operating agency) under Headquarters, United States Air Force, to a numbered air force aligned under Air Combat Command.  USAF also realigned the 9th Reconnaissance Wing and the 55th Wing under the new NAF.  It is headquartered at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. The United States Air Force's 102nd Intelligence Wing (102 IW), of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, is a military intelligence unit located at Otis Air National Guard Base, Massachusetts. Its primary subordinate operational unit is the 101st Intelligence Squadron. The 102nd Fighter Wing was formally re-designated the 102nd Intelligence Wing on 6 April 2008 and was planned to reach full operational capacity in 2010. Mission The wing mission is \"to provide world wide precision intelligence and command and control, along with trained and experienced airmen for expeditionary combat support and homeland security.\" In addition, the website says that their Air Force based mission is in line with the ability of joint force commanders to keep pace with information and incorporate it into a campaign plan. In addition to its strictly military role, the wing shares the overall Air National Guard mission of providing assistance during national emergencies such as natural disasters and civil disturbances.However, the 102nd Intelligence Wing has been ordered to halt its intelligence-gathering mission. Secretary Austin has ordered a DoD-wide review of the military intelligence practices to be completed in 45 days. The recertified 102nd ISRG (Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance group) resumed its intelligence mission on 1 June 2024. Units assigned  Current  Former  History According to the Air Force, the history of the 102nd begins with the 318th Fighter Group, which was active during World War II. After the war, the 318th was inactivated, and eventually the 102nd Fighter Wing was formed, which had a direct lineage link. In 1946, the 102nd was activated at Logan International Airport where it stayed until 1968, when it moved to Otis Air Force Base. Beginning in 1946, the wing began regular patrols of the Northeastern United States which took place in conjunction with Air Force active duty units. In 1968, the 102nd was moved to Otis, where it continued its regular patrols until 1973.During the time that the wing had a flying mission, the wing deployed to many locations around the globe to assist in missions for the Air Force. In 1961, the wing deployed to France during the Berlin Crisis. Twenty eight years later, the wing deployed to Panama during Operation Coronet Nighthawk.\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"

Paraguay is a member of CONMEBOL. The Albirroja has qualified for eight FIFA World Cup competitions (1930, 1950, 1958, 1986, 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010), with their best performance coming in 2010 when they reached the quarter-finals. A regular participant at the Copa América, Paraguay have been crowned champions of the competition on two occasions (in 1953 and 1979). Paraguay's highest FIFA World Rankings was 8th (March 2001) and their lowest was 103 (May 1995). Paraguay was awarded second place with Best Move of the Year in 1996 for their rise in the FIFA Rankings.The national team's most successful period was under the coaching of Argentine Gerardo Martino, who was awarded with the South American Coach of the Year in 2007 and took Paraguay to the quarter-finals stage of the FIFA World Cup competition for the first time in history (in 2010) and also to the final of the 2011 Copa América, where Paraguay finished as runners-up. In Paraguay's entire history at the FIFA World Cup, only Carlos Gamarra and José Luis Chilavert hold the distinction of being selected as part of the All-Star Team, being for the 1998 edition. Paulo da Silva holds the most appearances for the national team with 148 matches and Roque Santa Cruz is the all-time leading goal scorer with 32 goals. Denis Caniza, who was present with the national team from 1996 to 2010, is the only player to have represented Paraguay in four consecutive FIFA World Cup competitions (1998, 2002, 2006, 2010). History  The beginning (1900–1930) Soon after the introduction of football in Paraguay by Williams Paats, the Liga Paraguaya de Futbol (today Asociación Paraguaya de Fútbol) was created in 1906. The 2023–24 season is the 136th season in the existence of Blackburn Rovers Football Club and the club's sixth consecutive season in the Championship. In addition to the league, they are also competing in the FA Cup and the EFL Cup. Season summary  May On 19 May 2023, Rovers confirmed their retained list for the 2023–24 season. The club confirmed Bradley Dack, Ben Brereton Diaz, Daniel Ayala, Danny Butterworth, Dan Pike, Sam Burns, Aidan Dowling,  George Chmiel, Will Blease & Ryan Wilson will all leave the club when their contracts end on 30 June. Jared Harlock, Lenni Cirino & Alex Baker have all had their contracts extended by a further 12 months, whilst Zak Gilsenan, Patrick Gamble and Isaac Whitehall have been offered new contracts. John Bovill (born 21 March 1886 in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, Scotland) was a British footballer who played as a striker for Liverpool F.C. in The Football League.  Bovill started his career at Rangers F.C. before he moved to England to play for Blackburn Rovers F.C. and Chesterfield F.C..  He stayed with Chesterefield after they lost their league status before he was signed by Liverpool.  He made 29 appearances for the club with 25 of those coming in the 1911–12 season. Blackburn Rovers F.C. were in Division One for the 1999-2000 season, having been relegated from the FA Premier League after seven years.  The expected comeback to the top flight did not materialise, in spite of several expensive purchases staying at the club.  Brian Kidd was sacked on 3 November 1999 after 11 months in charge, with Rovers 19th in the league despite more than £30 million having been spent on players in that time.  Long-serving coach Tony Parkes was placed in temporary charge of the team as the search for a successor began.  Former defender Colin Hendry, who had been part of the title winning team in 1995 and who had started his first spell at Ewood Park in the 1980s, was linked with a return to the club as player-manager.  Other names linked with the vacancy included Graeme Souness, Colin Todd, Roy Evans and Joe Kinnear. Blackburn Rovers F.C. Academy and Under-23s are the youth teams of Blackburn Rovers.  The Blackburn Rovers Academy holds Category One status. Roque González de Santa Cruz, SJ (17 November 1576 – 15 November 1628) was a Jesuit priest who was the first missionary among the Guarani people in Paraguay. He is honored as a martyr and saint by the Catholic Church. Life González was born in the city of Asunción, now part of Paraguay, on 17 November 1576. He was the son of the Spanish colonists Bartolomé González y de Villaverde and María de Santa Cruz, who were both from noble families. Due to the large native population in the region, he spoke Guaraní fluently from an early age, as well as his native Spanish.In 1598, at the age of 23, González was ordained a priest by Fernando Trexo y Senabria, the Bishop of Córdoba, to serve that diocese. In 1609 he became a member of the Society of Jesus, beginning his work as a missionary in what is now Brazil. He became the first European person to enter the region known today as the State of Rio Grande do Sul, extending the system of Jesuit reductions begun in Paraguay to that region.González' arrival in the area happened only after his developing delicate relationships of trust with local indigenous leaders, some of whom feared that the priests were preparing the way for the arrival of masses of Spanish colonists in their land.In 1613 González led the founding of the Reduction of San Ignacio Miní. In 1615 he founded Itapúa, which is now the City of Posadas in the Argentine Province of Misiones. Then he had to move the reduction to the other side of the river, now the site of the City of Encarnación. He also founded the reductions of Concepción de la Sierra Candelaria (1619), Candelaria (1627), San Javier, Yapeyú (now in the Province of Corrientes), San Nicolás, Asunción del Ijuí, and Caaró (now in Brazil). Herbert L. \"Harry\" Fecitt (1865 – 1946) was an English association football player of the Victorian era.  Born in Blackburn, he played for the Blackburn club King's Own F.C. before joining Blackburn Rovers in 1888.

Dian Fossey ( dy-AN; January 16, 1932 – c. December 26, 1985) was an American primatologist and conservationist known for undertaking an extensive study of mountain gorilla groups from 1966 until her murder in 1985. She studied them daily in the mountain forests of Rwanda, initially encouraged to work there by paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey. Gorillas in the Mist, a book published two years before her death, is Fossey's account of her scientific study of the gorillas at Karisoke Research Center and prior career. It was adapted into a 1988 film of the same name.Fossey was a leading primatologist, and a member of the \"Trimates\", a group of female scientists recruited by Leakey to study great apes in their natural environments, along with Jane Goodall who studies chimpanzees, and Birutė Galdikas, who studies orangutans.Fossey spent 20 years in Rwanda, where she supported conservation efforts, strongly opposed poaching and tourism in wildlife habitats, and made more people acknowledge the sapience of gorillas. Following the killing of a gorilla and subsequent tensions, she was murdered in her cabin at a remote camp in Rwanda in December 1985. Although Fossey's American research assistant was convicted in absentia, there is no consensus as to who killed her.Her research and conservation work helped reduce the downward population trend in mountain gorillas. Early life Fossey was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of Hazel (née Kidd), a fashion model, and George Edward Fossey III, a real estate agent and business owner. Her parents divorced when she was six. Her mother remarried the following year, to businessman Richard Price. Her father tried to keep in contact, but her mother discouraged it, and all contact was subsequently lost. Fossey's stepfather, Richard Price, never treated her as his own child. He would not allow Fossey to sit at the dining room table with him or her mother during dinner. A man adhering to strict discipline, Richard Price offered Fossey little to no emotional support. Although, by 1950, Richard and Hazel would relocate with Dian to Marin County, the same county where her father George Fossey, now married to Mrs. Gladys Bove (née Kohler), resided.

G. Jones?\n=========\nCONTEXT:\nJupiter's Legacy is an American superhero comic book series, first published in 2013, written by Mark Millar, drawn by Frank Quitely, colored and lettered by Peter Doherty and published by Image Comics.  Published as a series of eponymous limited series and interstitial prequel limited series, it is to date the longest series that Millar has published as part of his Millarworld line of creator-owned comics, spanning an issue run three times as long as his then-most recent series, \"Super Crooks\" and \"Nemesis\".  It is also the first collaboration between Millar and Quitely since their work on \"The Authority\" in 2001, and Quitely's first long-form work with a writer other than Grant Morrison. The universal mind, or universal consciousness, is a metaphysical concept suggesting an underlying essence of all beings and becoming in the universe. It includes the being and becoming that occurred in the universe prior to the emergence of the concept of mind, a term that more appropriately refers to the organic, human aspect of universal consciousness. It addresses inorganic being and becoming and the interactions that occur in that process without specific reference to the physical and chemical laws that try to describe those interactions. Those interactions have occurred, do occur, and continue to occur. Universal consciousness is the source that underlies those interactions and the awareness and knowledge they imply. Introduction The concept of the universal mind was presented by Anaxagoras, a pre-Socratic philosopher who arrived in Athens some time after 480 BC. He taught that the growth of living things depends on the power of mind within the organisms that enables them to extract nourishment from surrounding substances. For this concept of mind, Anaxagoras was commended by Aristotle. Both Plato and Aristotle, however, objected that his notion of mind did not include a view that mind acts ethically, i.e., acts for the “best interests” of the universe.The most original aspect of Anaxagoras's system was his doctrine of nous (\"mind\" or \"reason\"). A different Greek word, gnósi (knowledge), better reflects what is observed in the wider world of organic and inorganic beings than just the human world.Chu Ch’an says, “The universal mind, therefore, is something to which nothing can be attributed. Being absolute goes beyond attributes. If, for example, it were to be described as infinite, that would exclude from it whatever is finite, but the whole argument of the book is that the universal mind is the only reality and that everything we apprehend through our senses is nothing else but this mind. Even to think of it in terms of existence or non-existence is to misapprehend it entirely.” pp. 8–9The term surfaced again in later philosophy, as in the writings of Hegel. - Hegel writes:¤ 377  The knowledge of Mind is the highest and hardest, just because it is the most 'concrete' of sciences.

He is an automobile upholsterer by trade.Packard was elected by the New Hampshire House of Representatives Republican caucus to serve as minority leader for the 2008–2010 legislative session. In 2010, after Republicans flipped the chamber, Packard declined to be a candidate for the Republican nomination for the speakership. Conservative Tea Party supporter Bill O’Brien was elected speaker, having defeated the more moderate representative Gene Chandler, an ally of Packard, for the nomination in an upset. O’Brien appointed Packard chair of the transportation committee for the 2010–2012 legislative session.In December 2014, for the 2014–2016 session, Packard was appointed speaker pro tempore, the house’s third-ranking presiding officer, by speaker Shawn Jasper.  He was also appointed vice chair of the legislative administration committee. In November 2017, after the resignation of Speaker Shawn Jasper to serve as New Hampshire Commissioner of Agriculture, Packard was appointed deputy speaker, the house’s second-ranking presiding officer, by newly elected speaker Gene Chandler, the previous deputy speaker. He lost his post as deputy speaker when Democrats flipped the house in the 2018 elections.For the 2018–2020 legislative session, Packard served as deputy minority leader under minority leader Dick Hinch as well as on the Transportation and Rules Committees.After the death of newly-elected speaker Dick Hinch on December 9, 2020, Packard, who had again been appointed deputy speaker, told news sources that Hinch had cold-like symptoms that were not COVID-19-related.

Governors New Hampshire was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on June 21, 1788. Before it declared its independence, New Hampshire was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain.The original 1776 Constitution of New Hampshire did not provide for a chief executive. The office of President was created by the 1784 constitution, and renamed Governor in 1792. Governors served one-year terms until an 1877 amendment increased this to two years. there have never been any term limits for the office, nor is there a lieutenant governor; should the office become vacant, the president of the New Hampshire Senate acts as governor.

It is a transverse version of the Peirce quincuncial projection, and is named after American cartographer Oscar Sherman Adams, who published it in 1925. When it is used to represent the entire sphere it is known as the Adams doubly periodic projection. Like many conformal projections, conformality fails at certain points, in this case at the four corners.

Musser (1863–1950) was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and moved to Dickinson County, Kansas, in March 1884.  In November 1884 he married Amanda Eisenhower (1861–1951), whose brother David J. Eisenhower was the father of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  Musser farmed briefly near Abilene but in December 1889 took a job at the Belle Springs Creamery in Abilene, Kansas where he worked for 38 years.  In 1892, when the Eisenhower family was living in Texas, Musser made it possible for the family to move to Abilene (now the site of the Eisenhower Presidential Center) by obtaining a job for David J. Eisenhower at the Creamery.  Musser was active in the Brethren in Christ Church, and invested in real estate in the Abilene area. The Governor of the State of New Hampshire is the head of the executive branch of New Hampshire's state government. The governor of New Hampshire is the head of government of the U.S. state of New Hampshire. The governor is elected during the biennial state general election in November of even-numbered years. New Hampshire is one of only two states, along with bordering Vermont, to hold gubernatorial elections every two years as opposed to every four. Currently, the state's 82nd governor is Republican Chris Sununu, who has served since January 5, 2017.  In New Hampshire, the governor has no term limit of any kind. Only two governors have served more than three terms since the 18th century (when the term was for only one year), John Lynch, who won a fourth two-year term on November 2, 2010, and Sununu, who won a fourth two-year term on November 8, 2022. John Taylor Gilman had been the last governor before Lynch to serve longer than six years, serving 14 one-year terms as governor between 1794 and 1816. Gilman is one of seven governors to serve non-consecutive terms, the others being John Langdon, John Sullivan, William Plumer, Benjamin Pierce, James A. Weston, and John Gilbert Winant. Unlike in many other states in which executive councils are merely advisory, the Executive Council of New Hampshire has a strong check on the governor's power. The five-member council has a veto over many actions of the governor. Together, the governor and Executive Council approve contracts with a value of $5,000 or more, approve pardons, and appoint the directors and commissioners, judges, the attorney general and officers in the National Guard. To be qualified to be governor, one must be 30 years of age, a registered voter, and domiciled in New Hampshire for at least seven years.

After independence, from 1786 to 1791, \"President of the State of New Hampshire\" was the official style of the position. == Title ==\nTraditionally, the governors of the colonial Province of New Hampshire were titled as \"President of New Hampshire\", beginning with the appointment of the province's first president, John Cutt, in 1679.

Eisenhower, the culmination of an 18-year political career that also included a stint as the 67th governor of New Hampshire. He lost his White House position in a scandal when he accepted an expensive vicuña coat.    Early life  Born in East Dover, Vermont to grocer Clyde H. Adams and Winnie Marion Sherman, Adams was educated in public schools in Providence, Rhode Island, graduating from Hope High School. He received an undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College (1920), having taken time off briefly for a six-month World War I stint in the United States Marine Corps. While at Dartmouth, Adams helped found Cabin and Trail, Dartmouth's influential hiking club, and was a member of the New Hampshire Alpha chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.   He then went into the lumber business, first in Healdville, Vermont (1921), then to a combined lumber and paper business in Lincoln, New Hampshire. He also was involved in banking.    Political beginnings  Adams entered state politics in New Hampshire as a Republican legislator (1941–44; Speaker of the House, 1944). He served a term in the United States House of Representatives (1945–47), making a failed effort to capture the 1946 Republican gubernatorial nomination in New Hampshire. He lost to incumbent Charles M. Dale.  Adams won the governorship two years later, in 1948.    New Hampshire governorship  When Adams took office as governor, New Hampshire was suffering post-war recession. He called for frugality and thrift in both personal and state expenditures. Retirees were (and are) a significant part of New Hampshire's population; Adams called for increased state aid for the aged, and for legislation which would enable the state's seniors to qualify for Federal Old Age & Survivors Insurance. In 1950 he formed a Reorganization Committee to recommend changes in state operations, and he called for the legislature to act on the recommendations. It was during his time as Governor that the New Hampshire Right to Work law (which prevented people being forced to join unions) was repealed.  Adams's clipped New Hampshire twang and calls for frugality made him a virtual poster boy for Republican balanced budget values of the time.

He also served on the Board of Directors of the Panama Canal Company during the Eisenhower administration. \"And I don't care what it is\" is a phrase attributed to U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, and often misquoted.  For example, one encyclopedia says: \"Eisenhower once remarked that 'America makes no sense without a deeply held faith in God—and I don't care what it is.'\"  Some commentators, such as Will Herberg, argued that Eisenhower favored a generic, watered-down religion, or ridiculed Eisenhower's banality.  What Eisenhower actually said, when he was President-elect, was that the American form of government since 1776 was based on Judeo-Christian moral values.  Speaking extemporaneously on December 22, 1952, a month before his inauguration, Eisenhower actually said:\n=========\nQUESTION: f{question}\n=========\nANSWER: please answer less than 6 words"
