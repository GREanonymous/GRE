Some unreliable apocryphal accounts suggest Mary was 12-14 years old and betrothed to the 30-year-old Joseph, though these details are contested. In the temple, Mary was miraculously sustained by an angel until she was twelve, at which point an angel directed Zachariah to arrange her betrothal to a suitable widower in Israel.\ncontext 2: Mary, the daughter of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne, was a first-century Jewish woman from Nazareth, known as the mother of Jesus and revered in multiple faiths. According to the Gospels, Mary was a virgin chosen by God to conceive Jesus through the Holy Spirit, and later lived with John the Evangelist in Ephesus, a location possibly influenced by the worship of Artemis in Ephesian culture. The doctrine of Mary's perpetual virginity was early established in Christianity, supported by early Church Fathers like Irenaeus and Clement of Alexandria.\ncontext 3: According to the apocryphal Gospel of James, Mary was the daughter of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne. Before Mary's conception, Anne had been barren and was far advanced in years.\ncontext 4: Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a first-century Jewish woman from Nazareth who is revered in multiple faiths for her virgin conception of Jesus through the Holy Spirit. She was consecrated as a virgin in the Temple at age three and later betrothed to Joseph, with various traditions and titles attributing her with numerous spiritual and divine attributes. Mary's significance extends across Christian traditions, with titles like Mother of God and Theotokos, and beliefs in her miraculous Assumption or Dormition into heaven.\ncontext 5: The High Priest Zachariah blessed Mary, telling her that God had honored her name across generations, and placed her on the third step of the altar to receive divine grace. Mary was the eldest daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck, Francis and Mary Adelaide. At 25, she adopted the religious name \"Sister Mary of the Cross\" and, at the request of Bishop Laurence Bonaventure Sheil, founded a new school in Adelaide.\ncontext 6: Mary was a first-century Jewish woman of Nazareth, the wife of Joseph and the mother of Jesus.\ncontext 7: While in the temple, Mary was miraculously fed by an angel, until she was twelve years old. At that point an angel told Zachariah to betroth Mary to a widower in Israel, who would be indicated.\ncontext 8: In Christianity  In Christianity, Mary is commonly referred to as the Virgin Mary, in accordance with the belief that the Holy Spirit impregnated her, thereby conceiving her first-born son Jesus miraculously, without sexual relations with her betrothed Joseph, \"until her son [Jesus] was born\".\ncontext 9: Some apocryphal accounts state that at the time of her betrothal to Joseph, Mary was 12–14 years old, and he was thirty years old, but such accounts are unreliable.\ncontext 10: Mary resided in \"her own house\"[Lk.1:56] in Nazareth in Galilee, possibly with her parents, and during her betrothal — the first stage of a Jewish marriage — the angel Gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah by conceiving him through the Holy Spirit, and she responded, \"I am the handmaid of the Lord. Let it be done unto me according to your word.\"\ncontext 11: His mother was the eldest daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Teck (Francis and Mary Adelaide).\ncontext 12: She is also revered in the Baháʼí Faith and the Druze Faith.

She holds numerous titles and epithets across Christian traditions, including Mother of God, a title affirmed by the Council of Ephesus in 431, recognizing her son Jesus as both divine and human. Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and some Protestant traditions believe that Mary's body was miraculously assumed into heaven, known as the Assumption of Mary in Western Christianity and the Dormition of the Mother of God in Eastern Christianity.\ncontext 14: The English name Mary comes from the Greek Μαρία, a shortened form of the name Μαριάμ. Both Μαρία and Μαριάμ appear in the New Testament.    \ncontext 15: The Gospel of John states that Mary went to live with the Disciple whom Jesus loved,[Jn 19:27] identified as John the Evangelist.[citation needed] Irenaeus and Eusebius of Caesarea wrote in their histories that John later went to Ephesus, which may provide the basis for the early belief that Mary also lived in Ephesus with John.\ncontext 16: Mary's name in the New Testament manuscripts originates from the Aramaic מרים, transliterated as Maryam or Mariam, and later adapted into English as Mary through the Greek Μαρία. She holds numerous titles including the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Mary, the Mother of God in Western Christianity, and the Theotokos in Eastern Christianity, reflecting her diverse cultural and religious significance.
